We characterize for the first time the food web of Lake Gatun-a diverse and highly invaded tropical freshwater lake within the Panama Canal. We used stable isotope analysis to reconstruct the trophic structure of the fish community of Lake Gatun and to compare it to that of a minimally invaded reference lake, Lake Bayano. We found significant differences between the trophic structures of these two Neotropical lakes, notably that Lake Gatun's fish community was characterized by a longer food chain, greater isotopic diversity, a broader range of trophic positions and body sizes, and shifts in the isotopic positions of several native taxa relative to Lake Bayano. The degree of isotopic overlap between native and non-native trophic guilds in Lake Gatun was variable, with herbivores exhibiting the lowest (20%-29%) overlap and carnivores the greatest (81%-100%).

For four seasons, samples of the above-mentioned organisms were collected on five occasions (July and October 2018 and January, April, and July 2019) in Minamata Bay. Isotope analysis showed that Minamata Bay food web structures were almost entirely fueled by microphytobenthos. The THg values of the fish and macrobenthos species were positively correlated with their δ(13)C. This indicates that their diets, which were highly fueled by microphytobenthos, led to high THg bioaccumulation in both macrobenthos and fish. The feeding habits of fishes differ depending on the species, and they prey on organisms of many taxa, including fish (mainly Japanese anchovy), crabs, shrimp, copepods, annelids, and algae. Fish species that preyed on benthic crustaceans had high THg. These results suggest that the main pathway of Hg bioaccumulation in fish from Minamata Bay is the benthic food chain, which is primarily linked to benthic crustaceans fueled by microphytobenthos.","Animals and Food Chain and Bays and Environmental Monitoring and Fishes/metabolism and *Mercury/analysis and Isotopes/analysis and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2023/11/15 06:42,10.1007/s00244-023-01040-y [pii] and 10.1007/s00244-023-01040-y [doi],37919444,0357245,"FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury) and 0 (Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",United States,"© 2023.

The loss of apex predators in human-transformed landscapes can result in changes in the ecological roles of the remaining mesocarnivores. Decreased top-down control together with increased bottom-up forcing through greater availability of anthropogenic foods can result in a predation paradox. Understanding these changes is important for conserving ecological function and biodiversity in rapidly urbanising systems. Here, we use stable isotope analysis to provide insight into longer term changes in trophic position, niche width and overlap of an elusive, medium-sized urban adapter, the caracal (Caracal caracal) in and around the city of Cape Town, South Africa. Using fur samples (n = 168) from individuals along a gradient of urbanisation we find that overall caracals have a broad isotopic dietary niche that reflects their large variation in resource use. When accounting for underlying environmental differences, the﻿ intensity of anthropogenic pressure, measured using the Human Footprint Index (HFI), explained variation in both food subsidy use (δ(13)C values) and trophic status (δ(15)N values). The significantly higher δ(13)C values (P < 0.01) and lower δ(15)N values (P < 0.001) of caracals in more urbanised areas suggest that predator subsidy consumption occurs via predictable, anthropogenic resource subsidies to synanthropic prey. These prey species are predominantly primary consumers, resulting in shifts in diet composition towards lower trophic levels. Further, caracals using areas with higher HFI had narrower isotope niches than those in less impacted areas, likely due to their hyperfocus on a few lower trophic level prey species. This pattern of niche contraction in urban areas is retained when accounting for caracal demographics, including sex and age. The removal of apex predators in human-transformed landscapes together with reliable resource availability, including abundant prey, may paradoxically limit the ecological influence of the remaining predators, and bring about a degree of predator trophic downgrading. The dampening of top-down control, and thus ecosystem regulation, likely points to widespread disruption of trophic dynamics in rapidly developing areas globally.","Animals and Animals, Wild and *Carnivora and *Ecosystem and Food Chain and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and South Africa and Male and Female",2023/12/17 09:42,10.1038/s41598-023-48868-x [pii] and 48868 [pii] and 10.1038/s41598-023-48868-x [doi],38062237,101563288,0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),England,© 2023.

While the general assumption is that M and N scale linearly (on log-log axes), nonlinearity is regularly observed in natural systems, and is theorized to be driven by nonlinear scaling of trophic level (TL) with M resulting in the rapid transfer of energy to consumers in certain size classes. We tested this hypothesis with data from 31 stream food webs. We predicted that allochthonous subsidies higher in the web results in nonlinear M-TL relationships and systematic abundance peaks in macroinvertebrate and fish size classes (latter containing salmonids), that exploit terrestrial plant material and terrestrial invertebrates, respectively. Indeed, both M-N and M-TL significantly deviated from linear relationships and the observed curvature in M-TL scaling was inversely related to that observed in M-N relationships. Systemic peaks in M-N, and troughs in M-TL occurred in size classes dominated by generalist invertebrates, and brown trout.

Dietary analysis revealed that the relative contribution of stream periphyton to the diets of macroinvertebrates increased, while that of allochthonous resources, specifically leaf litter from the terrestrial ecosystems in the catchment, decreased in response to open canopy and nutrient enrichment in the streams. The trophic diversity also increased with the elevated light intensity and nutrient availability, while the trophic redundancy decreased, suggesting a reduced ability of the stream ecosystems to resist environmental changes. Nutrient enrichment also increased the δ(15)N ratios of periphyton and macroinvertebrates, indicating potential δ(15)N enrichment of stream benthos by nitrogen pollution.

Today, giant pandas exclusively consume bamboo and have distinctive tooth, skull, and muscle characteristics adapted to a tough and fibrous bamboo diet during their long evolution [1, 2]. A special feature, the pseudo-thumb, has evolved to permit the precise and efficient grasping of bamboo [3, 4]. Unlike those of extant pandas, little is known about the diet and habitat preferences of extinct pandas. Prevailing studies suggest that the panda shifted to specialized bamboo feeding in the Pleistocene [5, 6]; however, this remains questionable. Pandas now survive in a fraction of their historical habitat [7], but no specific information has been reported. Stable isotope analyses can be used to understand diet- and habitat-related changes in animals [8]. Isotopic signals in bone collagen reflect dietary compositions of ancient human diets [9, 10] and dietary changes between historical and modern animal populations [11, 12]. Here, we conduct stable isotope analyses of bone and tooth samples from ancient and modern pandas and from sympatric fauna. We show that pandas have had a diet dominated by C(3) resources over time and space and that trophic niches of ancient and modern pandas are distinctly different. The isotopic trophic and ecological niche widths of ancient pandas are approximately three times larger than those of modern pandas, suggesting that ancient pandas possibly had more complex diets and habitats than do their modern counterparts.

We quantified aquatic food webs along longitudinal stream gradients spanning the Rocky Mountain-Great Plains ecotone using community composition, functional traits, and stable isotopes. We predicted that increasing ecosystem size, productivity, and species richness along the gradient would positively influence aquatic trophic diversity (e.g., expanded vertical and horizontal trophic niche breadths). We also predicted that trophic redundancy among fish species would decrease moving downstream as species partition food resources (e.g., reduced trophic niche overlap). Consumer stable isotope data (δ(13) C and δ(15) N) revealed nonlinear changes in trophic diversity along the gradient. Invertebrate trophic diversity had a dome-shaped relationship with the gradient, strongly linked to an expanding then contracting δ(13) C range. Fish trophic diversity initially increased and then plateaued downstream, despite linearly expanding δ(13) C and δ(15) N ranges. Trophic redundancy within the fish community decreased downstream along the gradient. However, trophic redundancy also showed a nonlinear relationship with fish species richness; it initially declined, then began to increase when more than nine species were present, indicating a shift from niche partitioning to niche packing at intermediate species richness levels. This result suggests that while δ(13) C and δ(15) N ranges for fish communities increased across the gradient, niche packing within communities in the Great Plains caused overall trophic diversity to saturate. Our results demonstrate that food web structure along stream gradients reflects an interaction between factors that decrease trophic redundancy, such as increased living space and niche partitioning, versus factors that increase trophic redundancy, such as increased species richness and niche packing. Our study helps to explain how multiple mechanisms shape food web properties along longitudinal stream gradients, and where niche partitioning or niche packing may be dominant. Understanding the functional roles of organisms across similar environmental gradients in other ecosystems will be increasingly important because they determine how food webs, and thus ecosystem function, will respond to environmental change, biodiversity loss, or species invasions.",Animals and *Food Chain and *Ecosystem and Biodiversity and Invertebrates and Fishes,2023/07/04 06:42,10.1002/ecy.4103 [doi],37203414,0043541,NA,United States,© 2023 The Ecological Society of America.,10.1002/ecy.4103 [doi],community ecology and food webs and longitudinal gradient and niche partitioning and realized trophic niche and stable isotopes,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Marine resource subsidies may have profound effects on predator ecology, influencing population and niche dynamics. Expanding niches of top consumers can impact ecosystem resilience and interspecific interactions, affecting predator-prey dynamics and competition. We investigate the occurrence, importance, and impact of marine resources on trophic ecology and niche dynamics in a highly generalist predator, the caracal (Caracal caracal), on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. Caracals have flexible diets, feeding across a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic prey. We use carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of fur samples (n = 75) to understand trophic position and niche shifts in coastal and inland foragers, as well as the implications of a diet rich in marine resources. We found significant differences in isotope signatures between these groups, with higher δ(13)C (P < 0.05) and δ(15)N values (P < 0.01) in coastal foragers. Isotope mixing models reveal that these elevated signatures were due to non-terrestrial food subsidies, where approximately a third of coastal foraging caracal diet comprised marine prey. The addition of marine prey species to diet increased both the trophic level and isotope niche size of coastal foraging caracals, with potential impacts on prey populations and competition. Our results suggest that marine prey are an important dietary resource for coastal foraging caracals, where seabirds, including two endangered species, are a major component of their diet. However, there are likely risks associated with these resource benefits, as routine consumption of seabirds is linked with higher pollutant burdens, particularly metals. Increased encounters between this terrestrial predator and seabirds may be a result of increased mainland colonies due to changes in habitat availability and the highly opportunistic and generalist foraging behaviour of a native predator.",NA,2024/01/07 06:44,S0048-9697(24)00046-9 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.169912 [doi],38184259,0330500,NA,Netherlands,Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

After a pointed call for research on subsidies in the 1990s, an industry of empirical work has documented the ubiquitous role subsidies play in ecosystem structure, stability, and function. Here, we argue that physical constraints (e.g., water temperature) and species traits can govern a species' accessibility to resource subsidies, which has been largely overlooked in the subsidy literature. We examined the input of a high-quality, point-source anthropogenic subsidy (aquaculture feed) into a recipient freshwater lake food web. Using a combined bio-tracer approach, we detect a gradient in accessibility of the anthropogenic subsidy within the surrounding food web driven by the thermal preferences of three constituent species, effectively rewiring the recipient lake food web. Because aquaculture is predicted to increase significantly in coming decades to support growing human populations, and global change is altering temperature regimes, then this form of food web alteration may be expected to occur frequently.

To understand ecological implications of these environmental changes, we studied benthic food web structure on the coasts of Adélie Land during an event of unusually high sea ice cover (i.e. two successive austral summers without seasonal breakup). We used integrative trophic markers (stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur) to build ecological models and explored feeding habits of macroinvertebrates. In total, 28 taxa spanning most present animal groups and functional guilds were investigated. Our results indicate that the absence of seasonal sea ice breakup deeply influenced benthic food webs. Sympagic algae dominated the diet of many key consumers, and the trophic levels of invertebrates were low, suggesting omnivore consumers did not rely much on predation and/or scavenging. Our results provide insights about how Antarctic benthic consumers, which typically live in an extremely stable environment, might adapt their feeding habits in response to sudden changes in environmental conditions and trophic resource availability. They also show that local and/or global trends of sea ice increase in Antarctica have the potential to cause drastic changes in food web structure, and therefore to impact benthic communities.","Animals and Antarctic Regions and Aquatic Organisms/*physiology and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Climate Change and *Ecological Parameter Monitoring and Feeding Behavior and *Food Chain and Geologic Sediments/analysis and *Ice Cover and Invertebrates/*physiology and Models, Theoretical and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Seasons and Seawater/analysis and Sulfur Isotopes/analysis",2020/10/24 06:00,10.1038/s41598-019-44605-5 [pii] and 44605 [pii] and 10.1038/s41598-019-44605-5 [doi],31147605,101563288,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Sulfur Isotopes),England,NA,10.1038/s41598-019-44605-5 [doi] and 8062,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC6542827,The authors declare no competing interests.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The northwestern Atlantic has a history of heavy fishing, and over the past century has also experienced destructive bottom fishing and harmful mobile fishing gear. After confirming that preservation solvent did not alter the nitrogen stable isotopes of preserved samples, we used museum specimens and modern samples to analyze nitrogen stable isotopes in tissues of two common demersal fishes pre-1950 (1850 to 1950) compared to 2021 to assess changes in trophic positions of coastal New England consumers over this time period. Both the mesopredator Centropristis striata (black sea bass) and the benthivore Stenotomus chrysops (scup) experienced significant declines in trophic position during this time. C. striata declined almost a full trophic level, S. chrysops declined half a trophic level, and these species are now occupying almost the same trophic position. Heavy fishing activities potentially shorten food chains, simplify trophic complexity, lessen the separation of trophic niches, and generally flatten food webs. The consequences of these within-species shifts are poorly investigated but could generate underappreciated cascading impacts on community structure and function.

A backbone of classic niche theory is that local coexistence of competitors is favoured by the contraction or divergence of species' niches. However, this effect should depend on the diversity of resources available in the local environment, particularly when resources vary in multiple ecological dimensions. Here, we investigated how available resource breadth (i.e. prey diversity) and competition together shape multidimensional niche variation (between and within individuals) and interspecific niche overlap in 42 populations of congeneric tropical frog species. We modelled realized niches in two key trophic dimensions (prey size and carbon stable isotopes) and sampled available food resources to quantify two-dimensional resource breadth. We found a 14-fold variation in multidimensional population niche width across populations, most of which was accounted for by within-individual diet variation. This striking variation was predicted by an interaction whereby individual niche breadth increased with resource breadth and decreased with the number of congeneric competitors. These ecological gradients also interact to influence the degree of niche overlap between species, which surprisingly decreased with population total niche width, providing novel insights on how similar species can coexist in local communities. Together, our results emphasize that patterns of exploitation of resources in multiple dimensions are driven by both competitive interactions and extrinsic factors such as local resource breadth.","Animals and Anura/*physiology and Brazil and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and *Diet and *Environment and *Food Chain and Models, Biological",2020/04/29 06:00,rspb20190369 [pii] and 10.1098/rspb.2019.0369 [doi],31039715,101245157,0 (Carbon Isotopes),England,NA,10.1098/rspb.2019.0369 [doi] and 20190369,Leptodactylus and individual specialization and multidimensional and niche partitioning and niche shift and stable isotopes,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,PMC6532515,We declare we have no competing interests.,NA,Dryad/10.5061/dryad.bj7rn5t and figshare/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4479833,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Invasive piscivore diet plasticity could complicate suppression success; thus, understanding invasive predator consumption is insightful to meeting conservation targets. Here, we determine if diet plasticity exists in an invasive apex piscivore and whether plasticity could influence native species recovery benchmarks and invasive species suppression goals. We compared diet and stable isotope signatures of invasive lake trout and native Yellowstone cutthroat trout (cutthroat trout) from Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming, U.S.A. as a function of no, low-, moderate-, and high-lake trout density states. Lake trout exhibited plasticity in relation to their density; consumption of cutthroat trout decreased 5-fold (diet proportion from 0.89 to 0.18) from low- to high-density state. During the high-density state, lake trout switched to amphipods, which were also consumed by cutthroat trout, resulting in high diet overlap (Schoener's index value, D = 0.68) between the species. As suppression reduced lake trout densities (moderate-density state), more cutthroat trout were consumed (proportion of cutthroat trout = 0.42), and diet overlap was released between the species (D = 0.30). A shift in lake trout δ13C signatures from the high- to the moderate-density state also corroborated increased consumption of cutthroat trout and lake trout diet plasticity. Observed declines in lake trout are not commensurate with expected cutthroat trout recovery due to lake trout diet plasticity. The abundance of the native species in need of conservation may take longer to recover due to the diet plasticity of the invasive species. The changes observed in diet, diet overlap, and isotopes associated with predator suppression provides more insight into conservation and suppression dynamics than using predator and prey biomass alone. By understanding these dynamics, we can better prepare conservation programs for potential feedbacks caused by invasive species suppression.",Animals and *Introduced Species and Trout and *Oncorhynchus and Diet and Wyoming,2023/03/03 06:00,PONE-D-22-19581 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0279099 [doi],36827303,101285081,NA,United States,"Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be and freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise and used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Along with the rapid urbanization of developing countries, population encroachment, deforestation, and land-use modifications are expected to increase the risk of EID outbreaks. We show that the freshwater food-web collapse driven by land-use change has a nonlinear effect on the abundance of preferential hosts of a generalist bacterial pathogen, Mycobacterium ulcerans. This leads to an increase of the pathogen within systems at certain levels of environmental disturbance. The complex link between aquatic, terrestrial, and EID processes highlights the potential importance of species community composition and structure and species life history traits in disease risk estimation and mapping.

There is a distinct lack of research regarding their ecological response to climatic events in the Global South. This region is predicted to experience climatic events such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) more often and with greater severity with the potential to alter the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems significantly. From 2015 to 2016 South Africa experienced one of the most severe country-wide droughts as a result of a strong ENSO event. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of this supra-seasonal drought on the trophic structure of fish communities in a naturally saline shallow lake of a Ramsar wetland using stable isotope techniques. Fishes and potential basal sources were collected from the lake, during predrought conditions in 2010 and after severe drought (recovery phase; 2017). The δ(13)C and δ(15)N values of food web elements were determined and analysed using Bayesian mixing models and Bayesian Laymen metrics to establish the proportional contribution of C(3) and C(4) basal sources to the fish (consumer) diets, and examine the fish community in terms of isotopic niche and trophic structure, respectively. Fish consumers relied predominantly on C(3) basal sources in the predrought and shifted to greater reliance on C(4) basal sources, decreased isotopic niche space use and a reduction in trophic length in the recovery phase. Drought altered the type and abundance of the basal sources available by limiting sources to those that are more drought-tolerant, reducing the trophic pathways of the food web with no significant alterations in the fish community. These results demonstrate the resilience and biological plasticity of Lake Nyamithi and its aquatic fauna, highlighting the importance of freshwater inflow to saline lakes with alterations thereof posing a significant threat to their continued functioning.",Animals and Bayes Theorem and *Droughts and Ecosystem and Fishes/physiology and Food Chain and Isotopes and *Lakes/chemistry,2022/06/09 06:00,S0048-9697(22)02431-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155338 [doi],35452726,0330500,0 (Isotopes),Netherlands,Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The food web structure can indicate the response of these ecosystems to ecological threats, such as fish introduction, by analyzing the trophic dynamics. Nonetheless, the food webs of tropical HMLs are less well-studied than temperate HMLs. The present study assessed the food webs of two neighboring (600 m apart) tropical HMLs, El Sol and La Luna, inside the crater of the Nevado de Toluca volcano, Mexico. It used stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) and Bayesian mixing models with different trophic discrimination factors and priors to assess the impacts of introduced rainbow trout, persisting only in the larger lake, El Sol. The food web in Lake El Sol was more complex than in Lake La Luna, mainly due to its larger size, extensive vegetated littoral zone, and being fueled by autochthonous primary production. In contrast, the smaller and fishless Lake La Luna has a reduced and bare littoral zone that harbored a simple food web substantially sustained by allochthonous carbon inputs. The persistence of introduced rainbow trout in Lake El Sol but not in Lake La Luna accentuated the differences between the lakes. The models suggested that rainbow trout fed on key consumers of littoral macroinvertebrates (70-80%) and pelagic zooplankton (20-30%), increasing the linkage between sub-networks. In both tropical HMLs, the species richness and herbivorous fraction were elevated compared with temperate HMLs, while the linkage density and omnivorous fraction were lower. Basal nodes dominated these tropical HMLs, and the vegetated littoral zone of Lake El Sol had more intermediate (omnivore) nodes.

Lake trout invasion increased fish diet variability (trophic dispersion), displaced native fishes from their reference diets (trophic displacement), and reorganized macroinvertebrate communities, indicating strong food web disruption. Trophic dispersion was greatest 25 to 50 y after colonization and dissipated as food webs stabilized in later stages of invasion (>50 y).

Individual effects of both stressors on basal resources available to stream communities have been described, with diversion reducing detritus standing stocks and pollution increasing biomass of primary producers. However, interactive effects of both stressors on the structure and trophic basis of food webs remain unknown. We hypothesized that the interaction between both stressors increases the contribution of the green pathway in stream food webs. Given the key role of the high-quality, but less abundant, primary producers, we also hypothesized an increase in food web complexity with larger trophic diversity in the presence of water diversion and pollution. To test these hypotheses, we selected four rivers in a range of pollution subject to similar water diversion schemes, and we compared food webs upstream and downstream of the diversion. We characterized food webs by means of stable isotope analysis. Both stressors directly changed the availability of basal resources, with water diversion affecting the brown food web by decreasing detritus stocks, and pollution enhancing the green food web by promoting biofilm production. The propagation of the effects at the base of the food web to higher trophic levels differed between stressors. Water diversion had little effect on the structure of food webs, but pollution increased food chain length and trophic diversity, and reduced trophic redundancy. The effects at higher trophic levels were exacerbated when combining both stressors, as the relative contribution of biofilm to the stock of basal resources increased even further. Overall, we conclude that moderate pollution increases food web complexity and that the interaction with water abstraction seems to amplify this effect.

Under these conditions, the growth of unpalatable, filamentous, N(2) -fixing cyanobacterial blooms, and their effect on planktonic food webs will become increasingly important. The planktonic food web structure in aquatic ecosystems at times of filamentous cyanobacterial blooms is currently unresolved, with discordant lines of evidence suggesting that herbivores dominate the mesozooplankton or that mesozooplankton organisms are mainly carnivorous. Here, we use a set of proxies derived from amino acid nitrogen stable isotopes from two mesozooplankton size fractions to identify changes in the nitrogen source and the planktonic food web structure across different microplankton communities. A transition from herbivory to carnivory in mesozooplankton between more eutrophic, near-coastal sites and more oligotrophic, offshore sites was accompanied by an increasing diversity of microplankton communities with aging filamentous cyanobacterial blooms. Our analyses of 124 biotic and abiotic variables using multivariate statistics confirmed salinity as a major driver for the biomass distribution of non-N(2) -fixing microplankton species such as dinoflagellates. However, we provide strong evidence that stratification, N(2) fixation, and the stage of the cyanobacterial blooms regulated much of the microplankton diversity and the mean trophic position and size of the metabolic nitrogen pool in mesozooplankton. Our empirical, macroscale data set consistently unifies contrasting results of the dominant feeding mode in mesozooplankton during blooms of unpalatable, filamentous, N(2) -fixing cyanobacteria by identifying the at times important role of heterotrophic microbial food webs. Thus, carnivory, rather than herbivory, dominates in mesozooplankton during aging and decaying cyanobacterial blooms with hitherto uncharacterized consequences for the biogeochemical functions of mesozooplankton.",Biomass and Cyanobacteria/metabolism/*physiology and Ecosystem and *Eutrophication and *Food Chain and Nitrogen/metabolism and *Nitrogen Fixation and Nitrogen Isotopes/metabolism and Plankton/classification/metabolism/*physiology and Salinity,2019/04/12 06:00,GCB14546 [pii] and 10.1111/gcb.14546 [doi],30628151,9888746,0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and N762921K75 (Nitrogen),England,© 2019 The Authors.

Food network unfolding is a theoretical method to transform a complex food web into a linear food chain based on ecosystem processes. Based on this method, we can define three biodiversity indices, horizontal diversity (D(H) ), vertical diversity (D(V) ) and range diversity (D(R) ), which are associated with the species diversity within each trophic level, diversity of trophic levels, and diversity in resource use, respectively. These indices are related to Shannon's diversity index (H'), where H' = D(H)  + D(V)  - D(R) .

We investigated these structural and functional properties of food webs in stream ecosystems distributed across woodland, agricultural and urban areas in the Zagreb region of Croatia. We compared resource availability and consumer diet composition using stable isotope mixing models and tested how the isotopic variance of basal resources, primary consumers, macroinvertebrate predators and other food web characteristics change with different land-use types. Combination of increased loading and altered composition of nutrients, lower water discharge and higher light availability at urban sites likely promoted the contribution of aquatic macrophytes to diets of primary consumers. Macroinvertebrate predators shifted their diet, relying more on active filterers at urban sites relative to woodland and agricultural sites. Urban food webs also had lower trophic redundancy (i.e. fewer species at each trophic level) and a more homogenized energy flow from lower to higher trophic levels. There was no effect of land use on isotopic variation of basal resources, primary consumers or macroinvertebrate predators, but all these trophic groups at urban and agricultural sites were (15) N-enriched relative to their counterparts in woodland stream food webs. The physical and chemical ecosystem characteristics associated with intensive land use altered the resource availability, trophic redundancy and the flow of energy to other trophic levels, with potentially negative consequences for community dynamics and ecosystem functioning.

However, invasive species, such as black rats, thrive on tropical islands and disrupt the natural pathways of nutrient subsidies by reducing seabird colonies. Here, we used stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon to examine the role of seabirds in subsidizing the terrestrial food webs and adjacent coral reefs in the Abrolhos Archipelago, Southwest Atlantic Ocean. By sampling invasive rats and multiple ecosystem compartments (soil, plants, grasshoppers, tarantulas, and lizards) within and outside seabird colonies, we showed that seabird subsidies led to an overall enrichment in (15) N across the food web on islands. However, contrary to other studies, δ(15) N values were consistently lower within the seabird colonies, suggesting that a higher seabird presence might produce a localized depletion in (15) N in small islands influenced by seabirds. In contrast, the nitrogen content (%N) in plants and soils was higher inside the colonies, corresponding to a higher effect of seabirds at the base of the trophic web. Among consumers, lizards and invasive rats seemed to obtain allochthonous resources from subsidized terrestrial organisms outside the colony. Inside the colony, however, they showed a more direct consumption of marine matter, suggesting that subsidies benefit these native and invasive animals both directly and indirectly. Nonetheless, in coral reefs, scleractinian corals assimilated seabird-derived nitrogen only around the two smaller and lower-elevation islands, as demonstrated by the substantially higher δ(15) N values in relation to the reference areas. This provides evidence that island morphology may influence the incorporation of seabird nutrients in coral reefs around rat-invaded islands, likely because guano lixiviation toward seawater is facilitated in small and low-elevation terrains. Overall, these results showed that seabirds affected small islands across all trophic levels within and outside colonies and that these effects spread outward to coral reefs, evidencing resiliency of seabird subsidies even within a rat-invaded archipelago.

Using a previously-developed model (Islam 2005), we estimated that a trout farm in the vicinity released 1.4 tons of nitrogen into the river. This was comparable to an estimated total nutrient load of 2.1 tons of nitrogen for the six-month fish-rearing period based on a web-based constituent load estimator (LOADEST). A model estimate of river nitrogen concentration at the time of minimum river discharge (100 L/s) was 2.74 mg/L. Despite relatively high nitrogen loading from the farm, isotope data showed typical food web structure. Several biological groups had elevated δ(13)C or δ(15)N values, but there was limited evidence for the entry of organic matter from the trout farm into the food web, with sites above and below trout farms having inconsistent patterns in (15)N enrichment. By coupling nitrogen load modeling with stable isotope analysis we showed that stable isotopes might not be effective tracers of organic matter into food webs, depending on surrounding land use and other point sources of nutrients.

Quantifying trophic position-individual body size relationships (trophic allometries) underpins the development of size-structured ecosystem models to predict abundance and the transfer of energy through ecosystems. Trophic allometries are well studied for fishes but remain relatively unexplored for cephalopods. Cephalopods are important components of coastal, oceanic and deep-sea ecosystems, and they play a key role in the transfer of biomass from low trophic positions to higher predators. It is therefore important to resolve cephalopod trophic allometries to accurately represent them within size-structured ecosystem models. We assessed the trophic positions of cephalopods in an oceanic pelagic (0-500 m) community (sampled by trawling in a cold-core eddy in the western Tasman Sea), comprising 22 species from 12 families, using bulk tissue stable isotope analysis and amino acid compound-specific stable isotope analysis. We assessed whether ontogenetic trophic position shifts were evident at the species-level and tested for the best predictor of community-level trophic allometry among body size, taxonomy and functional grouping (informed by fin and mantle morphology). Individuals in this cephalopod community spanned two trophic positions and fell into three functional groups on an activity level gradient: low, medium and high. The relationship between trophic position and ontogeny varied among species, with the most marked differences evident between species from different functional groups. Activity-level-based functional group and individual body size are best explained by cephalopod trophic positions (marginal R(2)  = 0.43). Our results suggest that the morphological traits used to infer activity level, such as fin-to-mantle length ratio, fin musculature and mantle musculature are strong predictors of cephalopod trophic allometries. Contrary to established theory, not all cephalopods are voracious predators. Low activity level cephalopods have a distinct feeding mode, with low trophic positions and little-to-no ontogenetic increases. Given the important role of cephalopods in marine ecosystems, distinct feeding modes could have important consequences for energy pathways and ecosystem structure and function. These findings will facilitate trait-based and other model estimates of cephalopod abundance in the changing global ocean.",Animals and Aquatic Organisms and *Cephalopoda and *Ecosystem and Food Chain and Nutritional Status and Oceans and Seas,2021/04/14 06:00,10.1111/1365-2656.13333 [doi],32895913,0376574,NA,England,© 2020 British Ecological Society.,10.1111/1365-2656.13333 [doi],food web and mesopelagic and octopus and ontogenetic diet shift and predator-prey interaction and size spectrum and squid and trophodynamics,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We determined the accumulation and trophic transfer of 14 PFASs (5 short-chain and 9 long-chain) within the food web of the Yadkin-Pee Dee River of North Carolina and South Carolina, US. Food web components and pathways were determined by stable isotope analyses of producers, consumers, and organic matter. Analyses of water, sediment, organic matter, and aquatic biota revealed that PFASs were prevalent in all food web compartments. Biofilm, an aggregation of bacteria, fungi, algae, and protozoans and a basal resource for the aquatic food web, showed high PFAS accumulation (in 10 of 14 compounds), particularly for perfluorooctanoic acid, with the greatest mean concentration of 463.73 ng/g. The food web compartment with the most detections and greatest concentrations of PFASs was aquatic insects; all 14 PFASs were detected in individual aquatic insect samples (range of <limit of detection [<LOD] to 1670.10 ng/g of wet weight [WW]). These findings may suggest a trophic link between biofilm PFASs and aquatic insect PFASs. Individual fish tissue samples ranged from <LOD to 797.00 ng/g of WW, where perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) was the dominant PFAS among all samples (64%). The ova of an imperiled fish, the robust redhorse (Moxostoma robustum), had concentrations of 10 PFASs (range of <LOD to 482.88 ng/g of WW) and the highest PFOS concentration (482.88 ng/g of WW), indicating a likely maternal transfer. The trophic magnification factors (TMFs) calculated in this study showed that various taxa accumulated PFAS compounds differently. PFBS, a short-chain PFAS compound that would presumably exhibit lesser TMFs, had nine values among our compartments and organisms >1.0 (range of 0.57 to 2.33); it is possible that an unmeasured PFBS precursor may be accumulating in biota and metabolizing to PFBS, leading to a higher than expected TMFs for this compound. Our findings demonstrate the prevalence of PFASs in a freshwater food web with potential implications for ecological and human health.","*Alkanesulfonic Acids/analysis and Animals and Environmental Monitoring and *Fluorocarbons/analysis and Food Chain and Humans and North Carolina and Rivers and South Carolina and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2020/10/10 06:00,10.1021/acs.est.9b05007 [doi],32345015,0213155,"0 (Alkanesulfonic Acids) and 0 (Fluorocarbons) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",United States,NA,10.1021/acs.est.9b05007 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,EPA999999/ImEPA/Intramural EPA/United States,PMC8190818,NA,NA,NA,NA,NIHMS1602635,NA,NA,NA

By measuring fish Hg stable isotope ratios, we related temporal changes in Hg concentrations to varying Hg sources. Additionally, dietary tracers were necessary to identify food web influences. Through combined Hg, C, and N stable isotopic analyses, we were able to differentiate between a shift in Hg sources to fish and periods when energetic transitions (from dreissenid mussels) led to the assimilation of contrasting Hg pools (2000 to present). In the late 1980s, lake trout δ(202)Hg increased (0.4‰) from regulatory reductions in regional Hg emissions. After 2000, C and N isotopes ratios revealed altered food web pathways, resulting in a benthic energetic shift and changes to Hg bioaccumulation. Continued increases in δ(202)Hg indicate fish are responding to several United States mercury emission mitigation strategies that were initiated circa 1990 and continued through the 2011 promulgation of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule. Unlike archives of sediments, this fish archive tracks Hg sources susceptible to bioaccumulation in Great Lakes fisheries. Analysis reveals that trends in fish Hg concentrations can be substantially affected by shifts in trophic structure and dietary preferences initiated by invasive species in the Great Lakes. This does not diminish the benefits of declining emissions over this period, as fish Hg concentrations would have been higher without these actions.","Air Pollutants/analysis and Air Pollution/legislation & jurisprudence and Amphipoda/chemistry and Animals and Diet and Dreissena/chemistry and Environmental Policy and *Food Chain and Fresh Water/chemistry and Geologic Sediments/chemistry and Introduced Species and Lakes and Mercury Isotopes/analysis and Methylmercury Compounds/*analysis and Michigan and Predatory Behavior and Time Factors and Trout/*metabolism/physiology and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*analysis",2020/04/21 06:00,1907484116 [pii] and 201907484 [pii] and 10.1073/pnas.1907484116 [doi],31685632,7505876,"0 (Air Pollutants) and 0 (Mercury Isotopes) and 0 (Methylmercury Compounds) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",United States,Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

However, the trophic transfer of mercury through the aquatic food web may be impacted by several factors related to network complexity and the ecology of the species present. The present study addresses the interplay between trophic ecology and mercury contamination in the fish communities of two lakes in a pollution-impacted subarctic watercourse, exploring the role of both horizontal (feeding habitat) and vertical (trophic position) food web characteristics as drivers for the Hg contamination in fish. The lakes are located in the upper and lower parts of the watercourse, with the lower site located closer to, and downstream from, the main pollution source. The lakes have complex fish communities dominated by coregonids (polymorphic whitefish and invasive vendace) and several piscivorous species. Analyses of habitat use, stomach contents, and stable isotope signatures (δ(15) N, δ(13) C) revealed similar food web structures in the two lakes except for a few differences chiefly related to ecological effects of the invasive vendace. The piscivores had higher Hg concentrations than invertebrate-feeding fish. Concentrations increased with size and age for the piscivores and vendace, whereas habitat differences were of minor importance. Most fish species showed significant differences in Hg concentrations between the lakes, the highest values typically found in the downstream site where the biomagnification rate also was higher. Mercury levels in piscivorous fish included concentrations that exceed health authorization limits, with possible negative implications for fishing and human consumption.

This study first suggests an improved BMF (i.e., BMF') applied to mercury bioaccumulation in freshwater fish from four sites before and after rainfall. The diet source and TP of each fish were identified using nitrogen stable isotope of amino acids (δ(15)N(AAs)) combined with bulk carbon stable isotope (δ(13)C). The BMF' was calculated normalizing with TP and diet contributions derived from MixSIAR. The BMF' values (1.3-27.2 and 1.2-27.8), which are representative of the entire food web, were generally higher than TMF (1.5-13.9 and 1.5-14.5) for both total mercury and methyl mercury, respectively. The BMF' implying actual mercury transfer pathway is more reliable index than relatively underestimated TMF for risk assessment. The ecological approach for BMF calculations provides novel insight into the behavior and trophic transfer of pollutants like mercury.","Animals and Food Chain and *Mercury/analysis and Bioaccumulation and Amino Acids/metabolism and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis and Environmental Monitoring and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Fishes and Carbon Isotopes/analysis",2023/10/23 00:44,S0043-1354(23)01031-X [pii] and 10.1016/j.watres.2023.120591 [doi],37690411,0105072,"FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury) and 0 (Amino Acids) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Carbon Isotopes)",England,Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, urban areas can provide diet subsidies for wildlife species in the form of fruiting ornamental plants, trash, and domestic animals. Ecological opportunity in the forms of habitat and food heterogeneity are thought to be important mechanisms in maintaining individual specialization. Identifying which contexts, traits, and mechanisms determine the success or failure of individuals within an urban wildlife population could potentially provide predictions about which populations may succeed in human-dominated landscapes and which may experience local extinction. We used both scat and stable isotope analysis of whiskers to investigate the degree to which coyotes (Canis latrans) utilized anthropogenic subsidies and exhibited individual diet specialization across the urban-rural gradient in southern California. Land use surrounding scat and isotope sample locations was also evaluated to determine the effect of land cover on diet. Human food constituted a significant portion of urban coyote diet (22% of scats, 38% of diet estimated by stable isotope analysis). Domestic cats (Felis catus) and ornamental fruit and seeds were also important items in urban coyote diets. Consumption of anthropogenic items decreased with decreasing urbanization. In suburban areas, seasonality influenced the frequency of occurrence of anthropogenic subsidies with increased consumption in the dry season. The amount of altered open space (areas such as golf courses, cemeteries, and landscaped parks) nearby had a negative effect on the consumption of anthropogenic items in both urban and suburban areas. Contrary to our hypothesis, urban coyotes displayed reduced between-individual variation compared to suburban and rural coyotes. It is possible that the core urban areas of cities are so densely developed and subsidized that wildlife inhabiting these areas actually have reduced ecological opportunity. Suburban animals had the broadest isotopic niches and maintained similar individual specialization to rural coyotes. Wildlife in suburban areas still have access to relatively undisturbed natural areas while being able to take advantage of anthropogenic subsidies in neighboring residential areas. Therefore, areas with intermediate urban development may be associated with increased ecological opportunity and specialization.","Animals and Animals, Wild and California and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Cities and Coyotes/*physiology and Diet and Ecosystem and Feces/chemistry and Female and Humans and Male and Models, Biological and Natural Resources and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Seasons and Urbanization and Vibrissae/chemistry",2020/05/08 06:00,PONE-D-19-21059 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0228881 [doi],32023321,101285081,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen-15) and FDJ0A8596D (Carbon-13),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0228881 [doi] and e0228881,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC7001990,The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Understanding the ecological role of overexploited and endangered predators is essential to deciphering how their feeding behaviour influences food web dynamics. In this study, the authors investigated the feeding behaviour of the common and IUCN-listed Near Threatened (NT) thornback ray Raja clavata, using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope and stomach content analysis (SCA). It has recently suffered an 87% decline in reported catches from the Sea of Marmara within the last decade. These results show that thornback ray mainly feeds on teleost species, except in summer, with both methods showing this species changes its diet ontogenetically by SCA. This ontogenetic diet shift was at lengths 40-50 cm by changing group preferences from Crustacea to Teleostei. MixSIAR results showed that both adult and juvenile individuals of R. clavata feed mainly on the crustaceans, but the contribution of teleosts represented by Trachurus sp. was very low (<15%). The trophic position increased total length and was higher than other batoid species in the Sea of Marmara.","Animals and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Crustacea and Diet/veterinary and Fishes and Food Chain and Gastrointestinal Contents/chemistry and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Nutritional Status and *Skates, Fish",2022/09/15 06:00,10.1111/jfb.15123 [doi],35638307,0214055,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),England,© 2022 Fisheries Society of the British Isles.,10.1111/jfb.15123 [doi],dietary shift and elasmobranch and feeding strategy and mesopredator and thornback ray and trophic position,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,"FDK-2018-30841/Bilimsel Arascedil;tirma Projeleri Birimi, Istanbul and Uuml;niversitesi/ and MAB-2021-37457/Bilimsel Arascedil;tirma Projeleri Birimi, Istanbul and Uuml;niversitesi/ and HAYSUD/2014/05/01/T.C.

Mean δ(13)C values in teeth declined significantly over time, from -13.01 ± 0.55‰ historically to -14.41 ± 0.28‰ in 2000, while no consistent pattern was evident for δ(15)N due to high individual variability within each period. The temporal shift in isotopic niche is consistent with beluga feeding ecology changing in recent decades to a more pelagic and less isotopically diverse diet or an ecosystem wide change in isotope profiles. Mercury concentrations in modern beluga teeth were 3-5 times higher on average than those in historical beluga. These results are similar to the long-term trends of Hg and feeding ecology reported in other beluga populations and in other Arctic marine predators. Similar feeding ecology shifts across regions and species indicate a consistent increased pelagic diet response to climate change as the Arctic Ocean progressively warmed and lost sea ice. Previously, significant temporal Hg increase in beluga and other Arctic animals was attributed solely to direct inputs of anthropogenic Hg from long-range sources. Recent advances in understanding the Arctic marine Hg cycle suggest an additional, complementary possibility─increased inputs of terrestrial Hg of mixed anthropogenic-natural origin, mobilized from permafrost and other Arctic soils by climate warming. At present, it is not possible to assign relative importance to the two processes in explaining the rise of Hg concentrations in modern Arctic marine predators.","Animals and Arctic Regions and *Beluga Whale/physiology and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and *Mercury/analysis and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2022/03/24 06:00,10.1021/acs.est.1c05389 [doi],34914363,0213155,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",United States,NA,10.1021/acs.est.1c05389 [doi],beluga and carbon-13 and climate change and global change. and human activity and mercury and nitrogen-15 and stable isotopes,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We examined the detrital pathways in mangrove food webs in native (Puerto Rican) and introduced (Hawaiian) Rhizophora mangle forests using a dual isotope approach and a mixing model. Based on trophic-level fractionation of 0-1 per thousand for delta(13)C and 2-3 per thousand for delta(15)N, among the invertebrates, only nematodes, oligochaetes, and nereid polychaetes from native mangroves exhibited stable isotopes consistent with a mangrove-derived diet. Certain fauna, in particular tubificid oligochaetes, had delta(13)C values consistent with the consumption of mangrove leaves, but they were depleted in (15)N, suggesting their primary nitrogen source was low in (15)N, and was possibly N(2)-fixing bacteria. In introduced mangroves, all feeding groups appeared to rely heavily on non-mangrove sources, especially phytoplankton inputs. Mixing model results and discriminant analysis showed clear separation of introduced and native mangrove sites based on differential food source utilization within feeding groups, with stronger and more diverse use of benthic foods observed in native forests. Observed differences between native and invasive mangrove food webs may be due to Hawaiian detritivores being poorly adapted to utilizing the tannin-rich, nitrogen-poor mangrove detritus. In addition, differential utilization of mangrove detritus between native and introduced mangroves may be a consequence of forest age. We postulate that increasing mangrove forest age may promote diversification of bacterial food webs important in N and S cycling.

However, because multiple biotic and abiotic drivers shape the trophic responses of predators to productivity, we often observe patterns, but not mechanisms, by which productivity drives food web structure. One way to capture mechanisms shaping trophic responses is to quantify trophic interactions among multiple trophic groups and by using complementary metrics of trophic ecology. In this study, we combine two diet-tracing methods: diet DNA and stable isotopes, for two trophic groups (top predators and intermediate predators) in both low- and high-productivity habitats to elucidate where in the food chain trophic structure shifts in response to changes in underlying ecosystem productivity. We demonstrate that while top predators show increases in isotopic trophic position (δ(15)N) with productivity, neither their isotopic niche size nor their DNA diet composition changes.

Due to analytical costs constraining the scope, sample size, and range of congeners analyzed, and variation in methodologies preventing cross-study syntheses, how PCBs biomagnify at food web, regional, and global scales remains uncertain. To overcome these constraints, we compiled diet (stable isotopes) data and lipid-normalized concentrations of sum total PCB (PCB(ST)), seven indicator PCB congeners, and their sum (PCB(∑7)). Our analyses revealed that the number of congeners analyzed, region, and class most strongly predicted PCB(ST), while similarly, region, class, and feeding location best predicted PCB(∑7) and all seven congeners. We also discovered that PCB(ST), PCB(∑7), and the seven indicator congeners all occur in higher concentrations in freshwater than marine ecosystems but are more likely to biomagnify in the latter. Moreover, although the seven congeners vary in their propensity to biomagnify, their trophic magnification factors are all generally greater in the Atlantic than the Pacific. Thus, novel insights regarding PCB biomagnification across taxonomic, food webs, regional, and global scales can be gleaned by leveraging existing data to overcome analytical constraints.","Bioaccumulation and Ecosystem and Food Chain and *Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2020/12/15 06:00,10.1021/acs.est.9b07693 [doi],32786558,0213155,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and DFC2HB4I0K (Polychlorinated Biphenyls)",United States,NA,10.1021/acs.est.9b07693 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) dominated the total PFAS (ΣPFAS) concentration (50-90% of ΣPFAS concentration), followed by C9-C11 perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs). The highest PFOS concentrations (79 ± 4.8 ng/g, wet weight (wwt)) and ΣPFAS (88 ± 5.2 ng/g, wwt) were detected in yellow perch (Perca flavescens). The C8-C14 PFAS biomagnification factors (BMFs) between apex piscivorous fish and prey fish were found to be generally greater than 1, indicative of PFAS biomagnification, while biodilution (BMF<1) was observed between planktivorous fish and zooplankton. Trophic magnification factors (TMFs) of C8-C14 PFCA were not correlated with perfluoroalkyl chain length. The C4-C9 PFAS were detected in the surface water of Lake Erie, and PFBA was found to have the highest concentrations (2.1-2.8 ng/L) among all PFAS detected. The log of bioaccumulation factor (BAF) was found to generally increase with increasing log K(ow) for C6, 8, and 9 PFAS in all selected species from three tropic levels.","Animals and Lakes and Bioaccumulation and Food Chain and Environmental Monitoring and *Fluorocarbons/analysis and *Perches and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis and Water and *Alkanesulfonic Acids/analysis and Zooplankton",2023/01/06 06:00,S0269-7491(22)01891-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120677 [doi],36400140,8804476,"9H2MAI21CL (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) and 0 (Fluorocarbons) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and 059QF0KO0R (Water) and 0 (Alkanesulfonic Acids)",England,Copyright © 2022.

In this study, we compared the two TP calculation methods and then reconsidered the evaluation of the trophic magnification factors (TMFs). Our results show that the TP(scaled) value is higher and the TMFs value is lower under the scaled Δ(15)N framework, indicating that the TMFs value under the constant Δ(15)N framework is often overestimated. We further constructed a diet proportion food web model, which shows that species with lower TP has higher contribution rate as food sources. In Xingkai Lake, the enrichment process of mercury in the food web is not strictly consistent with the diet proportion of the food web. Based on the diet proportion food web model and the mercury enrichment model, it can be found that the White shrimp (Exopalaemon modestus) is not only an important food source, but also the main source of mercury transmission in the food web. Overall, our findings have quantified the food web construction and thus facilitated a better understanding of the interaction between the diet proportion and the bio-concentration in the food web.","Animals and Environmental Monitoring/methods and Fishes and Food Chain and Lakes and *Mercury/analysis and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2022/08/26 06:00,10.1007/s11356-022-19874-9 [pii] and 10.1007/s11356-022-19874-9 [doi],35366206,9441769,"0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",Germany,"© 2022.

We investigated the role of human foods in ant diets across an urbanization gradient in Manhattan using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes. We found that some-but not all-ant species living in Manhattan's most urbanized habitats had δ(13)C signatures associated with processed human foods. In particular, pavement ants (Tetramorium sp. E) had increased levels of δ(13)C similar to δ(13)C levels in human fast foods. The magnitude of this effect was positively correlated with urbanization. By contrast, we detected no differences in δ(15)N, suggesting Tetramorium feeds at the same trophic level despite shifting to human foods. This pattern persisted across the broader ant community; species in traffic islands used human resources more than park species.

Evaluating Hg biomagnification in Arctic marine food webs is critical for understanding Hg dynamics and estimating exposure to understudied fish and wildlife consumed by humans. The majority of studies conducted on Hg biomagnification in the Arctic have focused on pelagic food webs. Benthic and benthopelagic food webs in Arctic marine ecosystems also support many species of subsistence and commercial importance, and data are lacking for these systems. In this study, we investigated food web structure and Hg biomagnification for the benthic, pelagic, and benthopelagic marine food webs of inner Frobisher Bay in Nunavut. Stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N), as well as total (THg) and methyl (MeHg) mercury concentrations were measured in fish, invertebrates, and zooplankton. Biomagnification in each food web was quantified with Trophic Magnification Slopes (TMS) and Trophic Magnification Factors (TMF). The highest TMS and TMF values were exhibited by the benthopelagic food web (TMS = 0.201; TMF = 1.59), followed by the pelagic food web (TMS = 0.183; TMF = 1.52), and lastly the benthic food web (TMS = 0.079; TMF = 1.20), with δ(15)N explaining 88%, 79%, and 9% of variation in Hg concentrations, respectively. TMS and TMF values were generally low compared to other Arctic marine food webs. Results from food web structure analyses indicated that the benthic food web had the greatest trophic diversity, trophic redundancy, and largest isotopic niche area of all food webs studied. Greater food web complexity may thus result in reduced MeHg biomagnification, but further study is required. Acquiring Hg and food web structure data is critical for predicting the effects of climate-induced environmental change on Hg dynamics, especially in the context of Arctic marine ecosystems.","Animals and Bioaccumulation and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and Fishes and Food Chain and *Mercury/analysis and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2022/07/07 06:00,S0048-9697(22)03521-5 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156424 [doi],35662606,0330500,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",Netherlands,Crown Copyright © 2022.

This ""dynamic food web approach"" is rarely applied at the coastal margin where aquatic and terrestrial systems are coupled and human development activities are often concentrated. We propose a simple model of ghost crab (Ocypode quadrata) feeding that predicts changing dominant prey (Emerita talpoida, Talorchestia sp., Donax variablis) along a gradient of beach morphology and test this model using a suite of 16 beaches along the Florida, USA coast. Assessment of beaches included quantification of morphological features (width, sediments, slope), macrophyte wrack, macro-invertebrate prey and active ghost crab burrows. Stable isotope analysis of carbon ((13)C/(12)C) and nitrogen ((15)N/(14)N) and the SIAR mixing model were used to determine dietary composition of ghost crabs at each beach. The variation in habitat conditions displayed with increasing beach width was accompanied by quantifiable shifts in ghost crab diet and trophic position. Patterns of ghost crab diet were consistent with differences recorded across the beach width gradient with respect to the availability of preferred micro-habitats of principal macro-invertebrate prey. Values obtained for trophic position also suggests that the generalist ghost crab assembles and augments its diet in fundamentally different ways as habitat morphology varies across a highly dynamic ecosystem. Our results offer support for a functional response in the trophic architecture of a common food web compartment (ghost crabs, macro-invertebrate prey) across well-known beach morphologies. More importantly, our ""dynamic food web approach"" serves as a basis for evaluating how globally wide-spread sandy beach ecosystems should respond to a variety of anthropogenic impacts including beach grooming, beach re-nourishment, introduction of non-native or feral predators and human traffic on beaches.",Animals and Bathing Beaches and Bivalvia/*physiology and Brachyura/*physiology and Carbon Isotopes and *Conservation of Natural Resources and Decapoda/*physiology and Diet and Ecosystem and Florida and Food Chain and Human Activities and Humans and Isotope Labeling and Nitrogen Isotopes and Predatory Behavior/*physiology and Regression Analysis,2016/07/07 06:00,PONE-D-15-42980 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0147759 [doi],26824766,101285081,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0147759 [doi] and e0147759,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC4732677,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the processes and sources of Hg in differing marine compartments (e.g. estuary, marine continental shelf (MCS) or pelagic area) have not been well studied, which makes it difficult to understand Hg cycling in marine ecosystems. To address this issue, the total Hg (THg) concentration, methylmercury (MeHg) concentration and stable Hg isotopes were determined in seawater and fish samples collected from differing marine compartments of the South China Sea (SCS). The results showed that the estuarine seawater exhibited substantially higher THg and MeHg concentrations than those in the MCS and pelagic seawater. Significantly negative δ(202)Hg (-1.63‰ ± 0.42‰) in estuarine seawater compared with that in pelagic seawater (-0.58‰ ± 0.08‰) may suggest watershed input and domestic sewage discharge of Hg in the estuarine compartment. The Δ(199)Hg value in estuarine fish (0.39‰ ± 0.35‰) was obviously lower than that in MCS (1.10‰ ± 0.54‰) and pelagic fish (1.15‰ ± 0.46‰), which showed that relatively little MeHg photodegradation occurred in the estuarine compartment. The Hg isotope binary mixing model based on Δ(200)Hg revealed that approximately 74% MeHg in pelagic fish is derived from atmospheric Hg(II) deposition, and over 60% MeHg in MCS fish is derived from sediments. MeHg sources for estuarine fish may be highly complex (e.g. sediment or riverine/atmospheric input) and further investigations are warranted to clarify the contribution of each source. Our study showed that Hg stable isotopes in seawater and marine fish can be used to identify the processes and sources of Hg in different marine compartments. This finding is of great relevance to the development of marine Hg food web models and the management of Hg in fish.","Animals and *Mercury/analysis and Mercury Isotopes/analysis/metabolism and Food Chain and Ecosystem and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis and Environmental Monitoring and *Methylmercury Compounds and Seawater and Fishes",2023/06/19 13:08,S0043-1354(23)00586-9 [pii] and 10.1016/j.watres.2023.120150 [doi],37269625,0105072,"FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury) and 0 (Mercury Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and 0 (Methylmercury Compounds)",England,Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

The TP(mix) model characterized the structure of the wetland food web more accurately and significantly improved the reliability of TMF compared to the TP(bulk), TP(AAs), and TP(simmr) models, which were calculated based on the methods of stable nitrogen isotope analysis of bulk, traditional AAs-N-CSIA, and weighted β(Glu/Phe), respectively.

The highest HOP biomagnification capacities (TMF(mix)) were found in the kingfisher food web (0.24-82.0), followed by the frog (0.08-34.0) and crab (0.56-11.7) food webs. The parabolic trends of TMF(mix) across combinations of log K(OW) in the frog food web were distinct from those of aquatic food webs (kingfisher and crab), which may be related to differences in food web composition and HOP bioaccumulation behaviors between aquatic and terrestrial organisms.

Epub and 2022 Sep 6.,313,1873-6424 (Electronic) and 0269-7491 (Linking),120108,"To provide insight into how climate-driven diet shifts may impact contaminant exposures of Arctic species, we compared feeding ecology and contaminant concentrations in ringed seals (Pusa hispida) from two Canadian sub-Arctic (Nain at 56.5°N, Arviat at 61.1°N) and two Arctic sites (Sachs Harbour at 72.0 °N, Resolute Bay at 74.7 °N). In the sub-Arctic, empirical evidence of changing prey fish communities has been documented, while less community change has been reported in the Arctic to date, suggesting current sub-Arctic conditions may be a harbinger of future Arctic conditions. Here, Indigenous partners collected tissues from subsistence-harvested ringed seals in 2018. Blubber fatty acids (FAs) and muscle stable isotopes (δ(15)N, δ(13)C) indicated dietary patterns, while measured contaminants included heavy metals (e.g., total mercury (THg)), legacy persistent organic pollutants (e.g., dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs)), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). FA signatures are distinct between sub-Arctic and Resolute Bay seals, likely related to higher consumption of southern prey species including capelin (Mallotus villosus) in the sub-Arctic but on-going feeding on Arctic species in Resolute Bay. Sachs Harbour ringed seals show FA overlap with all locations, possibly consuming both southern and endemic Arctic species. Negative δ(13)C estimates for PFAS models suggest that more pelagic, sub-Arctic type prey (e.g., capelin) increases PFAS concentrations, whereas the reverse occurs for, e.g., THg, ΣPBDE, and ΣDDT. Inconsistent directionality of δ(15)N estimates in the models likely reflects baseline isotopic variation not trophic position differences. Adjusting for the influence of diet suggests that if Arctic ringed seal diets become more like sub-Arctic seals due to climate change, diet-driven increases may occur for newer contaminants like PFASs, but not for more legacy contaminants. Nonetheless, temporal trends studies are still needed, as are investigations into the potential confounding influence of baseline isotope variation in spatial studies of contaminants in Arctic biota.","Animals and Canada and Climate Change and Fatty Acids and *Fluorocarbons and Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers/analysis and *Mercury/analysis and *Metals, Heavy and Persistent Organic Pollutants and *Phoca",2022/10/14 06:00,S0269-7491(22)01322-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120108 [doi],36084741,8804476,"0 (Fatty Acids) and 0 (Fluorocarbons) and 0 (Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers) and 0 (Metals, Heavy) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",England,Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

However, our understanding of the role of trophic niche in microplastic ingestion is still limited. Here, we quantified the level of microplastic (700 μm to 5 mm) contamination for macroinvertebrates and fish within the Garonne river. We then used stable isotope analyses (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) to quantify trophic niches. We first demonstrated that the abundance of ingested microplastics differed between macroinvertebrates and fish and was not significantly related to microplastic pollution. We then found that microplastic characteristics (shape, color, size, and polymer composition) differ between the abiotic (surface waters and sediments) and biotic (ingested by macroinvertebrates and fish) compartments. The abundance of ingested microplastics increased with the size of organisms in both fish and macroinvertebrates and tended to increase with trophic position in macroinvertebrates only. Finally, the origin of the resources consumed by fish significantly affected the abundance of microplastics ingested. Altogether, these results suggest the absence of microplastic bioaccumulation in freshwater food webs and the dominance of direct consumption, most likely accidentally. The use of stable isotope analyses is therefore crucial to improve our understanding of microplastic ingestion by wild organisms.","Animals and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and Food Chain and Fresh Water and Isotopes and *Microplastics and Plastics and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2021/04/10 06:00,10.1021/acs.est.0c06221 [doi],33410676,0213155,"0 (Isotopes) and 0 (Microplastics) and 0 (Plastics) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",United States,NA,10.1021/acs.est.0c06221 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Environ Sci Technol. 2021 Mar 2;55(5):3448.

Following the arrival of Neolithic groups in the 6th millennium BCE, the Northern Dongola Reach of Upper Nubia witnessed a cultural florescence manifested through elaborate funerary traditions. However, despite the wealth of archaeological data available from funerary contexts, including evidence for domesticated animals and plants as grave goods, the paucity of stratified habitation contexts hinders interpretation of local subsistence trajectories. While it is recognised archaeologically that, against the backdrop of increasing environmental deterioration, the importance of agriculture based on Southwest Asian winter cereals increased throughout the Kerma period (2500-1450 BCE), the contribution of domesticated cereals to earlier Neolithic herding economies remains unclear. This paper presents direct dietary data from a total of 55 Middle Neolithic and Kerma period individuals from Kadruka 21 and Kadruka 1. Microbotanical data obtained from human dental calculus and grave sediments are integrated with human and faunal stable isotopes to explore changes in dietary breadth over time. The combined results demonstrate the consumption of wild plant species, including C4 wetland adapted grasses, by Middle Neolithic individuals at Kadruka 1. Despite existing evidence for domesticated barley in associated graves, the results obtained in this study provide no clear evidence for the routine consumption of domesticated cereals by Middle Neolithic individuals. Rather, direct microparticle evidence for the consumption of Triticeae cereals is only associated with a single Kerma period individual and corresponds with an isotopic shift indicating a greater contribution of C3-derived resources to diet. These results provide evidence for Neolithic dietary flexibility in Upper Nubia through the persistence of foraging activities and support existing evidence linking increased agricultural reliance to the development of the Kerma culture.","Humans and Animals and History, Ancient and *Climate Change and *Animals, Domestic and Agriculture and Isotopes and Edible Grain and Archaeology and Diet and Poaceae",2023/02/07 06:00,PONE-D-22-23418 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0280347 [doi],36730175,101285081,0 (Isotopes),United States,"Copyright: © 2023 Le Moyne et al.

However, the manner in which eutrophication triggers a series of cascade effects in the whole food web in coastal lagoons has received little attention. Using stable isotope (SI) analyses, we investigated the food web structure in the hypertrophic lagoon of Yundang (Xiamen, China) in two periods of the year characterized by the recurrent alternation of Ulva lactuca and phytoplankton blooms in the cool (March) and warm (September) seasons, respectively. Large temporal fluctuations in the dominance of primary producers (i.e. macroalgae vs. phytoplankton) and, thus, in the available food items, were reflected in major changes in the diet and SI signals of several primary consumers, such as the amphipod Grandidierella japonica, the polychaetes Neanthes japonica and Capitella capitata, and omnivorous fishes (i.e. Mugil cephalus, Oreochromis niloticus, and Sardinella zunasi), while these changes were limited in top carnivorous fishes, such as Lateolabrax japonicus. Furthermore, reduced macrozoobenthic abundance available for omnivores in September was found to force omnivores to switch their feeding habits to those of herbivores. The present study provides evidence that the periodical alternation of macroalgal and phytoplankton blooms throughout the year strongly affect the relations among different trophic levels leading to a cascading effect across the whole food web and to major changes in the lagoon's food web structure. Importantly, our study shows that the lagoon's food web structure under persistent eutrophic conditions can still cope with seasonal changes in primary energy source type from macroalgae to microalgae due to the ability of omnivorous fishes to conduit different food sources up to the highest trophic levels. Thus, this study suggests that in such a highly variable eutrophic system, omnivores play a central role in the lagoon's functioning, and help to sustain the biological resources and the ecosystem services provided by the lagoon.",Animals and China and *Ecosystem and Eutrophication and *Food Chain and Phytoplankton,2020/11/11 06:00,S0141-1136(20)30413-X [pii] and 10.1016/j.marenvres.2020.105128 [doi],32916642,9882895,NA,England,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

We used a unique combination of stable isotope analysis and food-web energetics to analyze in a comprehensive way consequences of the conversion of rainforest into oil palm and rubber plantations on the structure of and channeling of energy through soil animal food webs in Sumatra, Indonesia. Across the animal groups studied, most of the taxa had lower litter-calibrated Δ(13)C values in plantations than in rainforests, suggesting that they switched to freshly-fixed plant carbon ('fast' energy channeling) in plantations from the detrital C pathway ('slow' energy channeling) in rainforests. These shifts led to changes in isotopic divergence, dispersion, evenness, and uniqueness. However, earthworms as major detritivores stayed unchanged in their trophic niche and monopolized the detrital pathway in plantations, resulting in similar energetic metrics across land-use systems. Functional diversity metrics of soil food webs were associated with reduced amount of litter, tree density, and species richness in plantations, providing guidelines on how to improve the complexity of the structure of and channeling of energy through soil food webs.

The extremely high levels these animals present demand for an urgent understanding of such processes and the development of new analytical techniques that go beyond the simple contamination monitoring. It was often proposed that prey selection or habitat use may affect Hg contamination in animals; however, it was never possible to measure which factor influences more rates and pathways of contamination. In this paper, we directly integrate toxicological information (Hg levels) and ecological tracers (stable isotopes of C, N and S) into a common data analysis framework (isotopic niches), with the aim of quantifying the influence of species' trophic behaviour on Hg contamination. The analysis was conducted on skin biopsies of fin whales Balaenoptera physalus, long-finned pilot whales Globicephala melas and sperm whales Physeter microcephalus. Their different trophic modes and residency in the area make them model species for the analysis of Hg accumulation along NWMS food webs. We measured Total Hg (T-Hg) concentrations through absorbance spectrometry with the DMA80 Milestone. Carbon, nitrogen and sulphur isotope compositions were measured via mass spectrometry in an IRMS coupled to an Elemental Analyser (EA) Isoprime. Comparison of ecological and contamination niches allowed to explain Hg accumulation in Mediterranean marine predators. Factors such as food web complexity, trophic position, hunting distribution or habitat use (e.g., foraging depth) did not influence Hg exposure. It is rather the selection of prey type, which determines the range of potential Hg sources and as a consequence the rates of accumulation in whales' tissues. A generalist piscivorous species such as the pilot whales will bioaccumulate more Hg than specialised sperm whales feeding mostly on cephalopods.","Animals and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and *Ecology and *Environmental Monitoring and Fin Whale/metabolism and *Food Chain and Isotopes/*analysis and Mediterranean Sea and Mercury Isotopes/analysis and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Sperm Whale/metabolism and Sulfur Isotopes/analysis and Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis and Whales/*metabolism and Whales, Pilot/metabolism",2020/01/07 06:00,S0045-6535(19)31672-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.124448 [doi],31398606,0320657,"0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Isotopes) and 0 (Mercury Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Sulfur Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",England,Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Riparian systems may be particularly vulnerable to ALAN. We investigated the impacts of ALAN on invertebrate community composition and food web characteristics for linked aquatic-terrestrial ecosystems. We focused on food chain length (FCL), a central property of ecological communities that can influence their structure, function, and stability; and the contribution of aquatically derived energy (i.e., nutritional subsidies originating from stream periphyton). We collected terrestrial arthropods and emergent aquatic insects from a suite of stream and wetland sites in Columbus, Ohio, USA. Stable isotopes of carbon ((13) C) and nitrogen ((15) N) were used to infer FCL and contribution of aquatically derived energy. We found that moderate-to-high levels of ALAN altered invertebrate community composition, favoring primarily predators and detritivores. Impacts of ALAN, however, were very taxon specific as illustrated, for example, by the negative impact of ALAN on the abundance of orb-web spiders belonging to the families Tetragnathidae and Araneidae: key invertebrate riparian predators. Most notably, we observed decreases in both invertebrate FCL and reliance on aquatically derived energy under ALAN (although aquatic energetic contributions appeared to increase again at higher levels of ALAN), in addition to shifts in the timing of reciprocal nutritional subsidies. Our study demonstrates that ALAN can alter the flows of energy between aquatic and terrestrial systems, thereby representing an environmental perturbation that can cross ecosystem boundaries.

As managers implement recovery plans, shifts in species interactions may occur broadly with potential consequences for ecosystem structure and function. In kelp forests off San Nicolas Island, California, USA, we describe striking changes in size structure and life history traits (e.g., size at maturation and sex change) of a heavily fished, ecologically important predator, the California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher). These changes occurred in two phases: (1) after intense commercial fishery exploitation in the late 1990s and (2) following recovery in the late 2000s, nearly a decade after management intervention. Using gut contents and stable-isotope values of sheephead and their prey, we found evidence for a dietary niche expansion upon recovery of population size structure to include increased consumption of sea urchins and other mobile invertebrate grazers by larger sized fish. By examining historical diet data and a time series of benthic community composition, we conclude that changes in dietary niche breadth are more likely due to the recovery of size structure from fishing than major shifts in prey availability. Size-dependent predator-prey interactions may have ecosystem consequences and management measures that preserve or restore size structure, and therefore historical trophic roles of key predators, could be vital for maintaining kelp forest ecosystem health.","Animals and *Ecosystem and *Fisheries and Fishes/*physiology and *Herbivory and Invertebrates/physiology and Kelp/*physiology and Models, Biological and Population Dynamics and Principal Component Analysis and Time Factors",2014/04/11 06:00,10.1890/13-0014.1 [doi],24649656,0043541,NA,United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Changes in an animal's isotopic values over time are generally assumed to indicate diet shifts or, less frequently, physiological changes. Although plant isotopic values are known to correlate with climatic seasonality, only a few studies restricted to aquatic environments have investigated whether temporal isotopic variation in consumers may also reflect environmental baselines through trophic propagation. We modeled the monthly variation in carbon and nitrogen isotope values in whole blood of four insectivorous bat species occupying different foraging niches in southern Spain. We found a common pattern of isotopic variation independent of feeding habits, with an overall change as large as or larger than one trophic step. Physiological changes related to reproduction or to fat deposition prior to hibernation had no effect on isotopic variation, but juvenile bats had higher δ13C and δ15N values than adults. Aridity was the factor that best explained isotopic variation: bat blood became enriched in both 13C and 15N after hotter and/or drier periods. Our study is the first to show that consumers in terrestrial ecosystems reflect seasonal environmental dynamics in their isotope values. We highlight the danger of misinterpreting stable isotope data when not accounting for seasonal isotopic baselines in food web studies. Understanding how environmental seasonality is integrated in animals' isotope values will be crucial for developing reliable methods to use stable isotopes as dietary tracers.",Animals and Carbon Isotopes/blood and Chiroptera/*blood and Climate and Diet and Ecosystem and Female and Food Chain and Male and Nitrogen Isotopes/blood and Seasons and Spain,2016/01/14 06:00,PONE-D-11-04290 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0117052 [doi],25700080,101285081,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0117052 [doi] and e0117052,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC4336313,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using stable isotope mixing models combined with gut content analysis and (137)Cs activity concentrations, this study investigated the hypothesis that an unexplored food web structure could be a contributing factor explaining the ecological half-life of (137)Cs in benthic flatfish. Benthic invertebrates and demersal fish species sampled in 2015 still showed (137)Cs activity concentrations higher than pre-accident. The mixing models of stable N and C isotopes and gut content analysis identified deposit, suspension and filter feeders to be the main flatfish food items in the benthos. There was a significant correlation between (137)Cs activity concentrations in specific flatfish species and benthos, and between (137)Cs activity concentrations in benthos and surface sediment. The results of this study partially explained the (137)Cs activity concentrations found in the analysed demersal fish, suggesting that the benthos can be a continuous source of (137)Cs for the demersal fish during this period of time. Extending monitoring programmes to include invertebrates that are not food species for humans would greatly improve our ability to understand the role of trophic transfer pathways and take appropriate management actions.","Animals and Cesium Radioisotopes/analysis and Food Chain and *Fukushima Nuclear Accident and Half-Life and Japan and *Radiation Monitoring and *Water Pollutants, Radioactive/analysis",2022/03/15 06:00,S0265-931X(22)00034-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.jenvrad.2022.106844 [doi],35202906,8508119,"0 (Cesium Radioisotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Radioactive) and 4T2E65IAR7 (Cesium-137)",England,Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Properly elucidating geochemical processes, quantifying contributions of natural and anthropogenic end members, and then protecting karst aquifer systems remain challenging from scientific and engineering aspects. To identify the hydrochemical processes and quantifying contributions of end members (especially, contamination end members), 49 samples were collected from cave waters (CW), artesian springs (AS), and gravity springs (GS) in a karst watershed in Guiyang, China. With increased anthropogenic contamination, the CW, AS, and GS characterized by a Ca-Mg-SO(4)(2-)-HCO(3)(-) composition often had pH and SO(4)(2-) concentrations exceeding USEPA secondary drinking water standards. That is attributed to the influence of water-rock interaction, rainfall, and anthropogenic sources (mainly, sewage and fertilizers), in agreement with the compositions of δ(34)S(SO4), δ(18)O(SO4), and (87)Sr/(86)Sr as well as the results of principal component analysis and correlation coefficients. Based on an end-member mixing model, contributions of rainfall and anthropogenic sources were 47% and 33% of GS, 52% and 41% of CW, and 58% and 35% of AS, respectively. It suggests that the karst groundwater quality is predominantly controlled by rainfall and anthropogenic sources (especially, land use). Results may be applied to properly evaluate the impacts of natural and anthropogenic sources on karst aquifers, coupled with actions to efficiently control potential contamination end members.","China and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and *Groundwater and Isotope Labeling and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2020/12/22 06:00,S0045-6535(20)32141-X [pii] and 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127946 [doi],33297017,0320657,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",England,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

To explore the utility of coupling molecular and chemical techniques for dietary characterizations, we applied DNA metabarcoding alongside stable isotope analysis to characterize the dietary niche of breeding Louisiana waterthrush (Parkesia motacilla), a migratory songbird hypothesized to preferentially provision its offspring with pollution-intolerant, aquatic arthropod prey. While DNA metabarcoding was unable to determine if waterthrush provision aquatic and terrestrial prey in different abundances, we found that specific aquatic taxa were more likely to be detected in successive seasons than their terrestrial counterparts, thus supporting the aquatic specialization hypothesis. Our isotopic analysis added greater context to this hypothesis by concluding that breeding waterthrush provisioned Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera, two pollution-intolerant, aquatic orders, in higher quantities than other prey groups, and expanded their functional trophic niche when such prey were not abundantly provisioned. Finally, we found that the dietary characterizations from each approach were often uncorrelated, indicating that the results gleaned from a diet study can be particularly sensitive to the applied methodologies. Our findings contribute to a growing body of work indicating the importance of high-quality, aquatic habitats for both consumers and their pollution-intolerant prey, while also demonstrating how the application of multiple, laboratory-based techniques can provide insights not offered by either technique alone.","Animals and *Songbirds/genetics and DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic and Ecosystem and Isotopes and Diet and DNA",2022/10/28 06:00,10.1111/mec.16688 [doi],36089910,9214478,0 (Isotopes) and 9007-49-2 (DNA),England,© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,10.1111/mec.16688 [doi],DNA metabarcoding and arthropods and diet and mixing models and stable isotope analysis and trophic niche,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

But the capacity for species to alter their trophic niches in response to global change, and the ways they do so when able, remain largely unknown. Here we examine food webs in three long-term and large-scale experiments to test how resource availability and nutritional requirements interact to determine an organism's trophic niche in the context of one of the largest global trends in land use-the rise in bioenergy production. We use carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses to characterize arthropod food webs across three biofuel crops representing a gradient in plant resource richness (corn monocultures, fields dominated by native switchgrass and restored prairie), and to quantify changes in the trophic niche of a widespread generalist ant species across habitats. In doing so, we measure the effects of basal resource richness on food chain length, niche breadth and trophic position. We frame our results in the context of two hypotheses that explain variation in trophic niche-the niche variation hypothesis which emphasizes the importance of resource diversity and ecological opportunity, and the optimal diet hypothesis which emphasizes dietary constraints and the availability of optimal resources. Increasing plant richness lengthened food chains by 10%-20% compared to monocultures. Niche breadths of generalist ants did not vary with resource richness, suggesting they were limited by optimal diet requirements and constraints rather than by ecological opportunity. The ants instead responded to changes in plant richness by shifting their estimated trophic position. In resource-poor monocultures, the ants were top predators, sharing a trophic position with predatory spiders. In resource-rich environments, in contrast, the ants were omnivores, relying on a mix of animal prey and plant-based resources. In addition to highlighting novel ecosystem impacts of alternate bioenergy landscapes, our results suggest that niche breadth and trophic diversification depend more on the presence of optimal resources than on ecological opportunity alone.",Animals and *Ants and Ecosystem and Food Chain and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Predatory Behavior,2021/04/20 06:00,10.1111/1365-2656.13407 [doi],33314089,0376574,0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),England,© 2020 British Ecological Society.,10.1111/1365-2656.13407 [doi],Tetramorium immigrans and Formicidae and biofuels and food chains and food webs and niche breadth and stable isotopes and trophic position,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The study aims to demonstrate that changes in political and social organization over time, for which the archaeological record suggests different goals of land use and modes of production, register through dietary patterns that are reflected in isotopic data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 173 dentin samples were taken from human individuals buried at three sites (Tell Ashara, Tell Masaikh and Gebel Mashtale) together with 15 animal bone samples. Distribution of the δ(13) C and δ(15) N values in collagen was interpreted in diachronic perspective, and with regard to lifetime shifts between childhood and adolescence. RESULTS: Diachronically, isotope signatures indicate a clear decrease in δ(15) N values accompanied by a small shift in δ(13) C values between the Old Babylonian (c. 1800-1600 BCE) and the Neo-Assyrian (c. 850-600 BCE) subsets. A major shift in δ(13) C values occurred between the Early Islamic (c. 600-1200 CE) and Modern (c. 1800-1950) periods. Ontogenetic changes only occur in a few individuals, but these suggest change of residence between childhood and adolescence. DISCUSSION: The depletion in (15) N from the Neo-Assyrian period onwards is best explained in terms of a shift from intensive to extensive farming, triggered by the fall of regional city-states after the Old Babylonian period and the formation of large supra-regional polities in the Neo-Assyrian period and later. The enrichment in (13) C during the Modern period was most likely the effect of more widely utilizing the dry steppes, abundant in C(4) plants, as pasture.","Adolescent and Agriculture/*history and Animals and Archaeology and Bone and Bones/chemistry and Carbon Isotopes/*analysis and Child and Dentin/chemistry and Diet/history and History, Ancient and Humans and Mesopotamia/ethnology and Nitrogen Isotopes/*analysis and Syria/ethnology",2018/12/15 06:00,10.1002/ajpa.23480 [doi],29665014,0400654,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),United States,"© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/ajpa.23480 [doi],Mesopotamia and carbon isotopes and diet and nitrogen isotopes and subsistence strategies,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It has therefore become essential to describe ecosystem statuses with respect to multinational protection schemes, often necessitating long-term monitoring programmes. Changes in the food-web structure, which can be monitored via stable isotope measurements, represent an important descriptor of the status of marine ecosystems. We investigated long-term changes (29 years) in isotopic values (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) in four indicative organisms at different trophic levels in the southern North and Baltic Seas: bladderwrack (Fucus vesiculosus), blue mussel (Mytilus ssp.), eelpout (Zoarces viviparus), and herring gull (Larus argentatus). Time series analyses using generalised additive models revealed largely consistent declines in δ(13)C and δ(15)N throughout all trophic levels of the coastal food web at all study sites, indicating a clear change in these coastal regions from 1988 to 2016. There were no clear long-term patterns in egg biometrics for herring gulls, except for a consistent increase in eggshell thickness. The declines in stable isotope values were in line with the results of previous long-term studies of single higher-trophic-level species, which suggested that the noted changes were mainly caused by altered foraging patterns of the studied species. The current results demonstrate that declines in δ(13)C and δ(15)N have occurred throughout the whole food web, not just in particular species. We discuss the possible reasons for the decrease in stable isotope values, including decreasing eutrophication and an increase in terrestrial carbon sources.",Animals and Aquatic Organisms/*chemistry and Baltic States and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Charadriiformes/metabolism and *Ecosystem and *Environmental Monitoring and *Food Chain and Fucus/chemistry and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Perciformes/metabolism,2018/09/27 06:00,10.1007/s10661-018-6827-8 [pii] and 10.1007/s10661-018-6827-8 [doi],29998431,8508350,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),Netherlands,NA,10.1007/s10661-018-6827-8 [doi],Fucus vesiculosus and Larus argentatus and Mytilus ssp. and Stable isotope and Time series analysis and Zoarces viviparus,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,FKZ 64486/Federal Environmental Agency/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Rainforest-to-pasture conversion stimulates the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The biotic methane cycle is driven by microorganisms; therefore, this study focused on active methane-cycling microorganisms and their functions across land-use types. We collected intact soil cores from three land use types (primary rainforest, pasture, and secondary rainforest) of two geographically distinct areas of the Brazilian Amazon (Santarém, Pará and Ariquemes, Rondônia) and performed DNA stable-isotope probing coupled with metagenomics to identify the active methanotrophs and methanogens. At both locations, we observed a significant change in the composition of the isotope-labeled methane-cycling microbial community across land use types, specifically an increase in the abundance and diversity of active methanogens in pastures. We conclude that a significant increase in the abundance and activity of methanogens in pasture soils could drive increased soil methane emissions. Furthermore, we found that secondary rainforests had decreased methanogenic activity similar to primary rainforests, and thus a potential to recover as methane sinks, making it conceivable for forest restoration to offset greenhouse gas emissions in the tropics.

Fruit bats provide critical ecosystem services including seed dispersal, but studies of how their diets are affected by habitat change have often been rather localized. This study used stable isotope analyses (δ15N and δ13C measurement) to examine how two fruit bat species in Madagascar, Pteropus rufus (n = 138) and Eidolon dupreanum (n = 52) are impacted by habitat change across a large spatial scale. Limited data for Rousettus madagascariensis are also presented. Our results indicated that the three species had broadly overlapping diets. Differences in diet were nonetheless detectable between P. rufus and E. dupreanum, and these diets shifted when they co-occurred, suggesting resource partitioning across habitats and vertical strata within the canopy to avoid competition. Changes in diet were correlated with a decrease in forest cover, though at a larger spatial scale in P. rufus than in E. dupreanum.

We calculated the contributions of major carbon sources [macroalgae, phytoplankton, suspended particulate organic matter (POM) and substrate organic matter (SOM)]. The results showed that: 1) the δ(13)C values of the three species ranged from -21.44‰ to -15.21‰, with an average value of (-16.85±1.12)‰, while the δ(15)N values ranged from 8.32‰ to 10.96‰, with an average value of (9.69±0.66)‰. There were significant differences in carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes among the three species. 2) There was small niche overlap between O. fasciatus and S. marmoratus, indicating that the interspecific competition was not intense. There was no overlap between C. myriaster and the first two, indicating feeding differentiation. 3) The total ecotone area, corrected core ecotone area, and food source diversity of C. myriaster were the highest, indicating that it had a more generalized diet and richer food sources. 4) With Mytilus coruscus as a baseline organism, the trophic level of C. myriaster was the highest (3.38), followed by S. marmoratus (3.09), and the trophic level of O. fasciatus was the smallest (3.00). 5) Results of the stable isotope mixture model (SIAR) showed that POM was the main carbon source of the three species, contributing 57.4%, 57.9%, and 92.0% of the total, respectively.

This limits the ability to predict how variations in sea-ice dynamics and productivity due to climate change will affect TE allocation in the food web. Here, food web structure of Tethys Bay (Terra Nova Bay, Ross Sea, Antarctica) was first characterised by analysing carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (δ(13)C, δ(15)N) in organic matter sources (sediment and planktonic, benthic and sympagic primary producers) and consumers (zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, fish and birds). Diet and trophic position were also characterised using Bayesian mixing models. Then, relationships between stable isotopes, diet and TEs (Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and V) were assessed in order to evaluate if and how horizontal (organic matter pathways) and vertical (trophic position) food web features influence TE transfer to the biota. Regressions between log[TE] and δ(13)C revealed that the sympagic pathway drives accumulation of V in primary consumers and Cd and Hg in secondary consumers, and that a coupled benthic/pelagic pathway drives Pb transfer to all consumers. Regressions between log[TE] and δ(15)N showed that only Hg biomagnifies across trophic levels, while all the others TEs showed a biodilution pattern, consistent with patterns observed in temperate food webs. Although the Cd behavior needs further investigations, the present findings provide new insights about the role of basal sources in the transfer of TEs in polar systems. This is especially important nowadays in light of the forecasted trophic changes potentially resulting from climate change-induced modification of sea-ice dynamics.","Animals and Antarctic Regions and Bayes Theorem and Bays and Biota and Environmental Monitoring/*methods and Fishes/*metabolism and *Food Chain and Invertebrates/*metabolism and Trace Elements/*metabolism and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*metabolism and Zooplankton/*metabolism",2019/04/10 06:00,S0269-7491(18)33421-3 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2018.12.071 [doi],30623833,8804476,"0 (Trace Elements) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",England,Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Don) forest ecosystems were studied during 2014-2016. For the experimental site in Yamakiya, Fukushima Prefecture, we present the redistribution of radiocesium among ecosystem compartments during the entire observation period, while the results obtained at another two experimental site were used to demonstrate similarity of the main trends in the Japanese forest ecosystems. Our observations at the Yamakiya site revealed significant redistribution of radiocesium between the ecosystem compartments during 2014-2016. During this same period radionuclide inventories in the aboveground tree biomass were relatively stable, however, radiocesium in forest litter decreased from 20 ± 11% of the total deposition in 2014 to 4.6 ± 2.7% in 2016. Radiocesium in the soil profile accumulated in the 5-cm topsoil layers. In 2016, more than 80% of the total radionuclide deposition in the ecosystem resided in the 5-cm topsoil layer. The radiocesium distribution between the aboveground biomass compartments at Yamakiya during 2014-2016 was gradually approaching a quasi-equilibrium distribution with stable cesium. Strong correlations of radioactive and stable cesium isotope concentrations in all compartments of the ecosystem have not been reached yet. However, in some compartments the correlation is already strong. An increase of radiocesium concentrations in young foliage in 2016, compared to 2015, and an increase in 2015-2016 of the (137)Cs/(133)Cs concentration ratio in the biomass compartments with strong correlations indicate an increase in root uptake of radiocesium from the soil profile. Mass balance of the radionuclide inventories, and accounting for radiocesium fluxes in litterfall, throughfall and stemflow, enabled a rough estimate of the annual radiocesium root uptake flux as 2 ± 1% of the total inventory in the ecosystem.","Cesium Isotopes/*analysis and Cesium Radioisotopes/*analysis and Cryptomeria and *Forests and *Fukushima Nuclear Accident and Japan and *Radiation Monitoring and Radioactivity and Soil Pollutants, Radioactive/*analysis",2018/03/02 06:00,S0265-931X(17)30284-9 [pii] and 10.1016/j.jenvrad.2017.09.026 [doi],29029765,8508119,"0 (Cesium Isotopes) and 0 (Cesium Radioisotopes) and 0 (Soil Pollutants, Radioactive)",England,Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We compared the faunal community structure and food web structure associated with before and after fishing moratorium between ARs and non-ARs in Wanshan Island, Pearl River Estuary using stable isotope techniques. Community composition showed higher differences between ARs and non-ARs. The range of δ(13)C and δ(15)N of different functional groups can distinguish the pelagic and benthic trophic pathways of the food web in reef-or-not area before and after fishing moratorium. The isotopic niches of entire faunal, as well as individual functional groups, overlapped less between ARs and non-ARs in Wanshan Island, which makes the isotopic functional indices non-equivalent. The total convex hull area (TA) of ARs was larger than that of non-ARs, indicating that nutrient pathways of ARs were more diverse. Overall, however, these results suggest that trophic structure was convergence between ARs and non-ARs, and differences before and after fishing moratorium, possibly due to seasonal differences.

Although it is crucial to determine its structure and function for water ecological health, MFW changes during lake melt period have not been well studied. In this study, the MFW was divided into three categories by analyzing its structure and trophic transfer efficiency using hierarchical C/N stable isotopes and eDNA sequencing techniques, including the detrital food web (DFC, 15 %), classical grazing food web (CFC, 60 %), and mixed trophic food web (MFC, 25 %). The trophic structure and type of MFW in ice-melting lakes are always in the process of succession and adaptation, which is in a relatively low trophic transfer efficiency stage under stable conditions (i.e. CFC), whereas the input of exogenous debris and organic pollutants may lead to an increase in MFW trophic transfer efficiency (i.e. MFC, DFC). The trophic transfer efficiency from the previous trophic level to protozoa and micrometazoa was 16.32 % and 20.77 % in DFC and 10.20 % and 29.43 % in MFC, respectively. Both are obviously higher than those of the CFC (11.69 % and 9.45 %, respectively). In terms of trophic structure, the community interaction and trophic cascade effect of DFC and MFC were enhanced but easily changed with environmental factors. In contrast, the core species and cascading effects of the CFC were clearer, and the MFW structure was relatively stable. Overall, this study reveals that the explosive increase in MFW trophic transfer efficiency induced by exogenous input during the lake melt period may subsequently lead to the destabilization of the microbial community structure and cause potential ecological risks. These are manifested in the absence of ecological trophic processes, the decrease in trophic structure complexity and stability, and the weakening of microecology self-adaptive regulation ability.","Animals and Ecosystem and Fishes and Food Chain and *Lakes/chemistry and Nitrogen Isotopes and Seasons and Water and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2022/08/18 06:00,S0048-9697(22)03990-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156893 [doi],35753488,0330500,"0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and 059QF0KO0R (Water)",Netherlands,Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Demersal fish and cephalopod assemblages were studied across a network of 24 shallow subtidal stations in the bay of Saint-Brieuc for their diversity, stable isotope compositions and stomach contents. The community was composed of 21 taxa, eight species accounting for 94.4% of the total abundance. Three different assemblages were identified along bathymetric gradient and spatial patterns in fish dredging. Marine POM and SOM were the most likely bases of food webs regarding δ(13)C range displayed by fish and cephalopod without differences among assemblages. Amphipoda was the main prey item in stomachs leading to significant diet overlaps among fish species, with some variations in additional items. Sepia officinalis was characterised by a singular diet and very low dietary overlap with other species. Contrasted stable isotope values and niche overlaps among species were evidenced in the δ(13)C/δ(15)N space.

Here we provide an overview of recent advances in uncovering the trophic structure of soil food webs using natural variations in stable isotope ratios. We discuss approaches of application, normalization and interpretation of stable isotope ratios along with methodological pitfalls. Analysis of published data from temperate forest ecosystems is used to outline emerging concepts and perspectives in soil food web research. In contrast to aboveground and aquatic food webs, trophic fractionation at the basal level of detrital food webs is large for carbon and small for nitrogen stable isotopes. Virtually all soil animals are enriched in (13) C as compared to plant litter. This 'detrital shift' likely reflects preferential uptake of (13) C-enriched microbial biomass and underlines the importance of microorganisms, in contrast to dead plant material, as a major food resource for the soil animal community. Soil organic matter is enriched in (15) N and (13) C relative to leaf litter. Decomposers inhabiting mineral soil layers therefore might be enriched in (15) N resulting in overlap in isotope ratios between soil-dwelling detritivores and litter-dwelling predators. By contrast, (13) C content varies little between detritivores in upper litter and in mineral soil, suggesting that they rely on similar basal resources, i.e. little decomposed organic matter. Comparing vertical isotope gradients in animals and in basal resources can be a valuable tool to assess trophic interactions and dynamics of organic matter in soil. As indicated by stable isotope composition, direct feeding on living plant material as well as on mycorrhizal fungi is likely rare among soil invertebrates. Plant carbon is taken up predominantly by saprotrophic microorganisms and channelled to higher trophic levels of the soil food web. However, feeding on photoautotrophic microorganisms and non-vascular plants may play an important role in fuelling soil food webs. The trophic niche of most high-rank animal taxa spans at least two trophic levels, implying the use of a wide range of resources. Therefore, to identify trophic species and links in food webs, low-rank taxonomic identification is required. Despite overlap in feeding strategies, stable isotope composition of the high-rank taxonomic groups reflects differences in trophic level and in the use of basal resources. Different taxonomic groups of predators and decomposers are likely linked to different pools of organic matter in soil, suggesting different functional roles and indicating that trophic niches in soil animal communities are phylogenetically structured. During last two decades studies using stable isotope analysis have elucidated the trophic structure of soil communities, clarified basal food resources of the soil food web and revealed links between above- and belowground ecosystem compartments. Extending the use of stable isotope analysis to a wider range of soil-dwelling organisms, including microfauna, and a larger array of ecosystems provides the perspective of a comprehensive understanding of the structure and functioning of soil food webs.",NA,2018/06/20 06:01,10.1111/brv.12434 [doi],29920907,0414576,NA,England,© 2018 Cambridge Philosophical Society.,10.1111/brv.12434 [doi],belowground communities and decomposer and energy channels and food chain and soil food web and soil invertebrates and trophic enrichment and trophic niche and δ13C and δ15N,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,CRC990 (EFForTS)/German Research Foundation (DFG)/ and Russian Academy of Sciences ('Biodiversity' program (#41))/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One important tool for assessing organism diet is bulk stable isotope analysis. However, key parameters necessary for interpreting the temporal context of stable isotope values are lacking, especially for Arctic species. This study provides the first experimental determination of isotopic turnover (as half-life) and trophic discrimination factors (TDFs) of both δ(13) C and δ(15) N in adult polar cod muscle. Using a diet enriched in both (13) C and (15) N, we measured isotopic turnover times of 61 and 49 days for δ(13) C and δ(15) N, respectively, with metabolism accounting for >94% of the total turnover. These half-life estimates are valid for adult polar cod (>3 years) experiencing little somatic growth. We measured TDFs in our control of 2.6‰ and 3.9‰ for δ(13) C and δ(15) N, respectively, and we conclude that applying the commonly used TDF of ~1‰ for δ(13) C for adult polar cod may lead to misrepresentation of dietary carbon source, while the use of 3.8‰ for δ(15) N is appropriate. Based on these results, we recommend that studies investigating seasonal shifts in the diet of adult polar cod sample at temporal intervals of at least 60 days to account for isotopic turnover in polar cod muscle. Although isotopic equilibrium was reached by the fish in this study, it was at substantially lower isotope values than the diet. Additionally, the use of highly enriched algae in the experimental feed caused very high variability in diet isotope values which precluded accurate calculation of TDFs from the enriched fish. As a result of the challenges faced in this study, we discourage the use of highly enriched diets for similar experiments and provide recommendations to guide the design of future isotopic turnover experiments.",Animals and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and *Muscles/chemistry and Carbon and Nutritional Status and Diet and Fishes/metabolism and *Gadiformes/metabolism,2023/06/09 06:41,10.1111/jfb.15389 [doi],36999199,0214055,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 7440-44-0 (Carbon),England,© 2023 The Authors.

Stable isotope ratios (δ(15) N and δ(13) C) of muscle tissue and stomach content analysis were used to quantify overlap of trophic niche space between vagrant tropical and local temperate fish communities along a 730 km (6°) latitudinal gradient. Our study shows that in recipient temperate ecosystems, sympatric tropical and temperate species do not overlap significantly in their diet-even though they forage on broadly similar prey groups-and are therefore unlikely to compete for trophic niche space. The tropical and temperate species we studied, which are commonly found in shallow-water coastal environments, exhibited moderately broad niche breadths and local-scale dietary plasticity, indicating trophic generalism.

Isotopic niche partitioning and comparison of trophic levels among these species (n = 21) were investigated using stable carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotope analysis. Overall, δ(13)C values were highly variable among taxa, indicating that the species exploit multiple foraging habitats along a coast-open ocean gradient. Overlap in δ(15)N values was limited, except for teleost species, the two species of sea turtles and two species of delphinids, the Indo-pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) and the Spinner dolphin (Stellena longirostris). Stable isotope analyses of samples collected over a 9-years period on different tissues with different integration times provide a consistent picture of the structure of the community of large marine vertebrates species around La Reunion and highlight the underlying mechanisms to limit the competition between species.

Drought treatment and farming systems did not affect abundances of the studied species. However, isotope values of some species increased in organically managed fields indicating a higher proportion of microorganisms in their diet. Trophic niche size, a measure of both isotope values combined, decreased with drought and under organic farming in some species presumably due to favored use of plants as basal resource instead of algae and microorganisms.

However, little is known about the fate of discards in marine environments. Discarding may provide food for various marine consumers, potentially affecting food web structure and stability. Yet, quantifying reliance upon discards is difficult because identity and frequency of discards may change according to multiple factors, and most previously used diet assessment techniques do not allow to assume consistency of feeding strategies over time. One currently untested hypothesis is that significant contribution of discards over time should reflect in increased trophic level (TL) of marine fauna, particularly in low TL consumers. Here, we explored this hypothesis by modeling the TL and assimilated diet of consumers living in fishing grounds subject to important discarding activity using stable isotope analysis. We found indications that benthic invertebrates and Chondrichthyes may depict a higher than expected TL, while other fish tend to depict similar to lower TL compared to global averages from the literature. Based on prior knowledge of discard consumption in the same area, stable isotope mixing models congruently revealed that discards may represent substantial portions of the assimilated diet of most benthic invertebrate macrofauna, cephalopods and Chondrichthyes.

Here, we used (13)C-labeled phenanthrene as the target and developed a new method coupling MMI-SIP and Raman-activated cell sorting (RACS), namely, MMI-SIP-RACS, to identify the active phenanthrene-degrading bacterial cells from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-contaminated wastewater. MMI-SIP-RACS significantly enriched the active phenanthrene degraders and successfully isolated the representative single cells. Amplicon sequencing analysis by SIP, (13)C shift of the single cell in Raman spectra, and the 16S rRNA gene from single cell sequencing via RACS confirmed that Novosphingobium was the active phenanthrene degrader. Additionally, MMI-SIP-RACS reconstructed the phenanthrene metabolic pathway and genes of Novosphingobium, including two novel genes encoding phenanthrene dioxygenase and naphthalene dioxygenase.

In southern Brazil, a swamp forest on an estuarine island is used by waterbirds for breeding, providing an opportunity to investigate the potential effects of transport of matter between nutrient-rich environments. Soil, plants, invertebrates, and blood from terrestrial birds were collected and stable isotopes compared to similar organisms in a control site without heronries. Values of δ(15)N and δ(13)C from waterbirds were higher in the colony in comparison to the control site (spatial effect). The enrichment of (15)N and (13)C provided during the active colony period persisted after the breeding period, especially for δ(15)N, which was higher in all compartments (temporal effect). Moreover, the enrichment of (15)N occurred along the entire trophic chain (vertical effect) in the colony environment, including different guilds of invertebrates and land birds. The enrichment in (13)C seems to lose strength and was mostly explained by factors such as trophic guild rather than site, especially in birds. Bayesian mixture models with terrestrial vs. estuarine endpoints demonstrated that all organisms from both colony and control environments had assimilated estuarine matter. Finally, detritivorous invertebrates showed greater assimilation when compared to other guilds.

As headwater streams are important sources of organic materials and nutrients to larger systems, this connectivity may also increase MeHg in downstream biota through direct or indirect effects of forestry on water quality or food web structure. In this study, we collected water, seston, food sources (biofilm, leaves, organic matter), five macroinvertebrate taxa and fish (slimy sculpin; Cottus cognata) at 6 sites representing different stream orders (1-5) within three river basins with different total disturbances from forestry (both harvesting and silviculture). Methylmercury levels were highest in water and some food sources from the basin with moderate disturbance (greater clearcutting but less silviculture). Water, leaves, stoneflies and fish increased in MeHg or total Hg along the river continuum in the least disturbed basin, and there were some dissipative effects of forest management on these spatial patterns. Trophic level (δ(15)N) was a significant predictor of MeHg (and total Hg in fish) within food webs across all 18 sites, and biomagnification slopes were significantly lower in the basin with moderate total disturbance but not different in the other two basins. The elevated MeHg in lower trophic levels but its reduced trophic transfer in the basin with moderate disturbance was likely due to greater inputs of sediments and of dissolved organic carbon that is more humic, as these factors are known to both increase transport of Hg to streams and its uptake in primary producers but to also decrease MeHg bioaccumulation in consumers. Overall, these results suggest that the type of disturbance from forestry affects MeHg bioaccumulation and trophic transfer in stream food webs and some longitudinal patterns along a river continuum.","Animals and Bioaccumulation and Environmental Monitoring and Fishes and Food Chain and Forests and Insecta and *Mercury and *Methylmercury Compounds and *Water Pollutants, Chemical",2022/08/31 06:00,S0269-7491(22)01024-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119810 [doi],35940481,8804476,"0 (Methylmercury Compounds) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",England,Crown Copyright © 2022.

Moreover, freshwater ecosystems are often affected by alien species introductions that can modify habitats and trophic relationships. Accordingly, the threat posed by metals interacts with those by alien species, since the latter can accumulate and transfer these substances across the food web to higher trophic levels. How metals transfer within such communities is little studied. We analysed the concentration of 14 metals/metalloids (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Zn, hereafter 'metal(s)') of eight fish and three crustacean species co-existing in the Arno River (Central Italy), most of which were alien. To assess the pathway of contaminants within the community, we coupled metal analysis with carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis derived from the same specimens. Crustaceans showed higher metal concentration than fish, except for Cd, Hg and Se that were higher in fish. We found evidence of trophic transfer for six metals (Cd, Cr, Hg, Mg, Se, Zn). Additionally, ontogenetic differences and differences among various fish tissues (muscle, liver, and gills) were found in metals concentration. Considerable biomagnification along the trophic chain was found for Hg, while other metals were found to biodilute. Using stable isotopes and Hg as a third diet tracer, we refined the estimations of consumed preys in the diet previously reconstructed with stable isotope mixing models. Alien species reach high biomass and can both survive to and accumulate high pollutants concentrations, potentially posing a risk for their predators and humans. A combined effect of environmental filtering and increased competition may potentially contribute to the disappearance of native species with lower tolerances.","Animals and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and Fresh Water and Humans and Introduced Species and Italy and *Metals, Heavy/analysis and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2020/12/19 06:00,S0269-7491(20)36470-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115781 [doi],33049575,8804476,"0 (Metals, Heavy) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",England,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides direct impacts on biodiversity, land uses can alter the functioning and structure of ecosystems. Central to this are impacts on food webs. The release of additional nutrients from human origin, habitat homogenization, or environmental filtering due to human land use can change the diet of individual consumer species (i.e., their trophic niches) and the distribution and overlap of trophic niches within a food web. However, it remains largely unclear whether the effects on food web properties vary between the different and predominant human land uses present on islands. Here, we investigated the impact of two dominant human land uses on small oceanic islands (i.e., urban and tourism development) and tested if and how different land uses on islands affect food web structure. To disentangle human land uses, we investigated islands, which were either privately owned by a tourist facility (i.e., exclusively tourism land use) or experienced urban development from the local population (i.e., urban land use), or remained uninhabited, serving as reference sites free of direct land use. Using stable isotope analysis, we show that isotope signature, trophic (isotopic) niches, and overall food web properties of the investigated island invertebrate communities were significantly changed under both land use regimes. While trophic diversity was reduced and trophic niche widths increased under tourism land use, the investigated food webs showed reduced trophic diversity at the food web base and a more uneven trophic niche distribution under urban land use. In summary, these findings show that different human land uses can have contrasting impacts on oceanic island food webs.

In Caohai Lake, an important karst wetland in southwestern China, karst surface water and groundwater are important recharge water sources, and nitrates flow into the wetland along with the surface water and groundwater, degrading the wetland water quality. Therefore, identifying the sources of nitrate in the surface water and groundwater in the Caohai catchment is of great significance to the protection of the wetland water environment. In this study, the nitrate concentrations, hydrochemistry and multiple stable isotope ratios (δ(18)O-H(2)O, δD-H(2)O, δ(15)N-NO(3)(-) and δ(18)O-NO(3)(-)) were used to identify the sources and fate of the NO(3)(-) in the groundwater and inflowing rivers around the Caohai wetland. The results showed that the NO(3)(-) concentrations in the groundwater samples from the southern side exceeded the WHO limit during the wet season, while other samples did not exceed the limit. The mean concentrations of NO(3)(-) in groundwater were higher than those in the inflowing river water, and NO(3)(-) concentrations decreased in the order of wet season>dry season>normal season in the groundwater and inflowing rivers. The hydrochemistry and multiple isotope ratios suggest that the nitrate transformation was dominated by nitrification processes, while denitrification had an influence on the transformation of NO(3)(-) (as evidenced by isotopes) in groundwater during the dry season. According to the analyses based on a stable isotope analysis in R (SIAR), sewage and manure were the main sources of NO(3)(-) in the groundwater, while sewage, manure and chemical fertilizer were the major sources of NO(3)(-) in the inflowing river water; therefore, the scientific use of farmland fertilizers and the treatment of domestic sewage should be strengthened to safeguard groundwater quality and control the NO(3)(-) concentrations in rivers.","China and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and *Groundwater and Nitrates/analysis and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Rivers and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis and Wetlands",2021/08/19 06:00,10.1007/s11356-021-13827-4 [pii] and 10.1007/s11356-021-13827-4 [doi],33880699,9441769,"0 (Nitrates) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",Germany,"© 2021.

Despite being the focus of many decades of intensive interest and research, the exact route(s), date(s), and mechanisms of the spread and adoption of wheat and barley into the existing well-established millet-based diet in northern China are still debated. As the majority of the important introduced crops are C3 plants, while the indigenous millet is C4, archaeologists can effectively identify the consumption of any introduced crops using stable carbon isotope analysis. Here we examine published stable isotope and dental caries data of human skeletal remains from 77 archaeological sites across northern and northwestern China. These sites date between 9000 to 1750 BP, encompassing the period from the beginning of agriculture to wheat's emergence as a staple crop in northern China. The aim of this study is to evaluate the implications of the spread and adoption of these crops in ancient China. Detailed analysis of human bone collagen δ13C values reveals an almost concurrent shift from a C4-based to a mixed C3/ C4- based subsistence economy across all regions at around 4500-4000 BP. This coincided with a global climatic event, Holocene Event 3 at 4200 BP, suggesting that the sudden change in subsistence economy across northern and northwestern China was likely related to climate change. Moreover, the substantially increased prevalence of dental caries from pre-to post-4000 BP indicates an increase in the consumption of cariogenic cereals during the later period. The results from this study have significant implications for understanding how the adoption of a staple crop can be indicative of large-scale environmental and socio-political changes in a region.","Archaeology/*history and Bone and Bones/chemistry and Carbon Isotopes/*chemistry and China and *Climate Change and Crops, Agricultural/history and Dental Caries/diagnosis/physiopathology and Diet and Edible Grain/chemistry and History, Ancient and Humans and Millets/*chemistry",2020/02/19 06:00,PONE-D-18-25664 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0218943 [doi],31329608,101285081,0 (Carbon Isotopes),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0218943 [doi] and e0218943,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC6645670,The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Studies of chipmunks (Tamias spp.) in Yosemite National Park provide an important opportunity to explore the reasons for this variation in response. While the alpine chipmunk (T. alpinus) has undergone a significant elevational range contraction over the past century, the congeneric and partially sympatric lodgepole chipmunk (T. speciosus) has not experienced an elevational range shift during this period. As a first step toward identifying the factors underlying this difference in response, we examined evidence for dietary changes and changes in cranial morphology in these species over the past century. Stable isotope analyses of fur samples from modern and historical museum specimens of these species collected at the same localities indicated that signatures of dietary change were more pronounced in T. alpinus, although diet breadth did not differ consistently between the study species. Morphometric analyses of crania from these specimens revealed significant changes in cranial shape for T. alpinus, with less pronounced changes in shape for T. speciosus; evidence of selection on skull morphology was detected for T. alpinus, but not for T. speciosus. These results are consistent with growing evidence that T. alpinus is generally more responsive to environmental change than T. speciosus, but emphasize the complex and often geographically variable nature of such responses.

To investigate temporal changes in spider prey and variations in prey due to landscape structure around rice fields, carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of rice field arthropods were analysed over three consecutive sampling dates during the rice cropping season. Initial isotope composition of gnats and midges emerging from submersed rice fields indicates a larval algae diet, while later values suggest a switch to rice-derived carbon. Initial δ(13)C values of plant- and leafhoppers were higher in fields of rice-heterogeneous landscapes, indicating migration from source populations feeding on C4 grasses into rice fields; later, their δ(13)C values approached those of rice. Isotope values of web-building and cursorial spiders in the earliest samples indicate aquatic gnat and midge prey. The later shift toward terrestrial herbivore prey was more pronounced for small than for larger species and in rice paddies near permanent vegetation, indicating use of prey from the surrounding landscape. The results suggest that rice field spiders are supported by three different carbon pools: (1) aquatic carbon originating from algae and (2) legacy carbon from previous growing cycles, both incorporated via between-season predation on gnats and midges, and (3) carbon from the current rice season incorporated via herbivore prey. In conclusion, fostering aquatic midge and gnat larvae, e.g. via mulching, and integrating rice fields into rice-heterogeneous landscapes likely strengthens biological control of pest species in rice paddies by supporting high populations of spiders between cropping seasons.",Animals and Carbon and Ecosystem and Food Chain and *Oryza and Predatory Behavior and *Spiders,2020/03/10 06:00,10.1007/s00442-020-04601-3 [pii] and 4601 [pii] and 10.1007/s00442-020-04601-3 [doi],32002648,0150372,7440-44-0 (Carbon),Germany,NA,10.1007/s00442-020-04601-3 [doi],Biological control and Generalist predators and Rice field and Rice insect pest and Stable isotopes,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,01LL0917A-01LL0917O/Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung/,PMC7058567,The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The variations in the stable isotope contents (δ(15)N and δ(13)C) were determined for three small pelagic fishes (i.e., Engraulis encrasicolus, Sardina pilchardus, and Sprattus sprattus, respectively known as anchovies, sardines and sprats) collected across the western side of the basin. Our data allowed to determine the width and features of their trophic niches, to assess potential overlap or resource partitioning among them, and likely anticipate species adaptation to future climate change scenarios. Moreover, variations in stable isotope contents were correlated to both resource availability (i.e., mesozooplankton) and environmental variables. The high productivity and in turn the high resource availability of the basin, especially in the northern part, resulted in favor of the resource partitioning that occurs in each sub-area of the Adriatic Sea among the three species. Medium-sized specimens of the three species mostly fed on small zooplankton, while adult sprats relied on large copepods and those of sardines and anchovies also consumed large portion of phytoplankton, confirming the high trophic plasticity of these two dominants small pelagic species. However, considering that anchovies have the greatest degree of trophic diversity compared with the other two species, they could be the most adapted to changing feeding conditions.

Stable isotope analyses are a logistically simple but powerful tool for inferring trophic interactions and food web structure, but relatively few studies quantify seasonal variations in the food web structure or nutrient flux across multiple trophic levels. We determined the temporal dynamics in stable isotope compositions (carbon, nitrogen and sulphur) of a fish community from a highly seasonal, temperate estuary sampled monthly over a full annual cycle. Sulphur isotope values in fish tissues discriminated among consumers exploiting pelagic and benthic resources but showed no seasonal variation. This implied limited change in the relative consumption of pelagic and benthic resources by the fish community over the study period despite major seasonal changes in phytoplankton biomass. Conversely, carbon and nitrogen isotope values exhibited seasonality marked by the commencement of the spring phytoplankton bloom and peak chlorophyll concentration, with δ(13) C values following expected trends in phytoplankton growth physiology and variation in δ(15) N values coinciding with changes in major nitrogen sources to plankton between nitrate and ammonium. Isotope shifts in fish muscle were detected within 2 weeks of the peak spring phytoplankton bloom, suggesting a rapid trophic transfer of carbon and nitrogen along food chains within the estuarine food web during periods of high production. Therefore we caution against the assumption that temporal averaging effectively dampens isotopic variability in tissues of higher trophic-level animals in highly dynamic ecosystems, such as temperate estuaries.

Representative research papers (16) focused on the use of stable isotopes (δ(13)C, δ(15)N, δ(34)S, δ(2)H, δD,206Pb/207Pb, and 208Pb/207Pb) to evaluate the effect of anthropogenic activities (Sewage discharge, timber harvesting-deforestation, metallurgical activities, hydrological disruption, aquaculture ponds, and urban development) on mangrove food webs were selected. Each article included at least one group of consumers (invertebrate or fish). Publications only focused on water quality or primary producers were not included. Most studies managed to determine the effect of the anthropogenic activities on the food web's stable isotope values. Based on the above, we concluded that these markers are an effective tool to determine affectation patterns on the structure and function of mangrove food webs. The results obtained herein facilitate the correct management of mangroves and their derived resources.",NA,2022/12/20 06:01,5086 [pii] and 10.1007/s10750-022-05086-2 [doi],36532364,9879627,NA,Netherlands,"© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022, and Springer Nature or its licensor (e.g. a society or other partner) holds exclusive and rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other and rightsholder(s); author self-archiving of the accepted manuscript version of this and article is solely governed by the terms of such publishing agreement and and applicable law.",10.1007/s10750-022-05086-2 [doi],Ecosystem management and Isotopic modeling and Mangrove trophic flows and Trophic ecology,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,PMC9734736,"Conflict of interestThis paper does not present social, political, or economic and conflicts of interests.

Given current conservation and revitalization efforts for tortoises and their habitats, here we investigate nineteenth and twentieth century Galápagos tortoise dietary ecology using museum and archaeological specimens coupled with analysis of carbon (δ(13)C(collagen) and δ(13)C(apatite)), nitrogen (δ(15)N), hydrogen (δD) and oxygen (δ(18)O(apatite)) stable isotopes and radiocarbon dating.

We used sudden CO(2)-outgassing and associated shifts in DIC-δ (13)C brought by waterfalls as an excellent natural experimental set-up to quantify impacts of changes in algal isotopic baselines on ecological inferences from IFIs. METHODS: Carbon (δ (13)C) and nitrogen (δ (15)N) stable isotopic ratios of invertebrate communities sharing similar structure were measured at above- and below-waterfall sampling sites from five rivers and streams in Southern Quebec (Canada). For each sampled invertebrate community, the six Laymans IFIs were then calculated in the δ -space (δ (13)C vs. δ (15)N). RESULTS: As expected, isotopic functional richness indices, measuring the overall extent of community trophic space, were strongly sensitive to changes in isotopic baselines unlike other IFIs. Indeed, other IFIs were calculated based on the distribution of species within δ-space and were not strongly impacted by changes in the vertical or horizontal distribution of specimens in the δ-space. Our results highlighted that IFIs exhibited different sensitivities to changes in isotopic baselines, leading to potential misinterpretations of IFIs in river studies where isotopic baselines generally show high temporal and spatial variabilities. The identification of isotopic baselines and their associated variability, and the use of independent trophic tracers to identify the actual energy pathways through food webs must be a prerequisite to IFIs-based studies to strengthen the reliability of ecological inferences of food web structural properties.",NA,2020/11/12 06:01,9999 [pii] and 10.7717/peerj.9999 [doi],33173615,101603425,NA,United States,©2020 Belle and Cabana.,10.7717/peerj.9999 [doi] and e9999,Aquatic food webs and Stable isotopes and Trophic structure and Waterfalls,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,PMC7594636,The authors declare there are no competing interests.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Understanding how regional-scale ocean conditions control nutrient availability and ultimately nutrient assimilation into food webs will inform how marine resources will change in response to climate. To evaluate how ocean conditions influence the assimilation of nitrogen and carbon into coastal marine food webs, we applied a novel dimension reduction analysis to a century of newly acquired molecular isotope data derived from historic harbor seal bone specimens. By measuring bulk δ(13) C and δ(15) N values of source amino acids of these top predators from 1928 to 2014, we derive indices of primary production and nitrogen resources that are assimilated into food webs. We determined coastal food webs responded to climate regimes, coastal upwelling, and freshwater discharge, yet the strength of responses to individual drivers varied across the northeast Pacific. Indices of primary production and nitrogen availability in the Gulf of Alaska were dependent on regional climate indices (i.e., North Pacific Gyre Oscillation) and upwelling. In contrast, the coastal Washington and Salish Sea food webs were associated with local indices of freshwater discharge. For some regions (eastern Bering Sea, northern Gulf of Alaska) food web-assimilated production was coupled with nitrogen sources; however, other regions demonstrated no production-nitrogen coupling (Salish Sea). Temporal patterns of environmental indices and isotopic data from Washington state varied about the long-term mean with no directional trend. Data from the Gulf of Alaska, however, showed below average harbor seal δ(13) C values and above average ocean conditions since 1975, indicating a change in primary production in recent decades. Altogether, these findings demonstrate stable isotope data can provide useful indices of nitrogen resources and phytoplankton dynamics specific to what is assimilated by food webs.",Alaska and Animals and Carbon and Ecosystem and *Food Chain and Nitrogen and Oceans and Seas and *Phoca and Washington,2021/05/28 06:00,10.1111/gcb.15551 [doi],33749968,9888746,7440-44-0 (Carbon) and N762921K75 (Nitrogen),England,© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,10.1111/gcb.15551 [doi],Gulf of Alaska and amino acid and climate change and compound-specific stable isotope analysis and harbor seals and northeast Pacific Ocean and primary production,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,"NA18OAR4170095/Washington Sea Grant, University of Washington/ and NA19OAR4170360/Washington Sea Grant, University of Washington/ and 2020-1116/Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the effects of invasion and pollution on food webs remain largely unexplored. Here, we used stable isotopes to examine the effects of common carp Cyprinus carpio and pollution on trophic dynamics in six small reservoirs. Our results revealed that the trophic niche widths of invertebrates, vertebrates, and invasive carp did not significantly differ among reservoirs with different pollution statuses. However, we found low niche conservatism among reservoirs, suggesting that while niche width may remain consistent, there is a shift in the position of the niches in isotopic space under both pollution and invasion scenarios.

Here we conducted a large-scale field experiment to characterize differences in food web composition and stable isotopes (δ¹³C, δ¹⁵N, δ³⁴S) for salmon rearing on a large floodplain and adjacent river in the Central Valley, California, USA. The study covered variable hydrologic conditions including flooding (1999, 2017), average (2016), and drought (2012-2015). In addition, we determined incorporation rates and tissue fractionation between prey and muscle from fish held in enclosed locations (experimental fields, cages) at weekly intervals. Finally, we measured δ³⁴S in otoliths to test if these archival biominerals could be used to reconstruct floodplain use. Floodplain-reared salmon had a different diet composition and lower δ13C and δ³⁴S (δ¹³C = -33.02±2.66‰, δ³⁴S = -3.47±2.28‰; mean±1SD) compared to fish in the adjacent river (δ¹³C = -28.37±1.84‰, δ³⁴S = +2.23±2.25‰). These isotopic differences between habitats persisted across years of extreme droughts and floods. Despite the different diet composition, δ¹⁵N values from prey items on the floodplain (δ¹⁵N = 7.19±1.22‰) and river (δ¹⁵N = 7.25±1.46‰) were similar, suggesting similar trophic levels. The food web differences in δ13C and δ³⁴S between habitats were also reflected in salmon muscle tissue, reaching equilibrium between 24-30 days (2014, δ¹³C = -30.74±0.73‰, δ³⁴S = -4.6±0.68‰; 2016, δ¹³C = -34.74 ±0.49‰, δ³⁴S = -5.18±0.46‰). δ³⁴S measured in sequential growth bands in otoliths recorded a weekly time-series of shifting diet inputs, with the outermost layers recording time spent on the floodplain (δ³⁴S = -5.60±0.16‰) and river (δ³⁴S = 3.73±0.98‰). Our results suggest that δ¹³C and δ³⁴S can be used to differentiate floodplain and river rearing habitats used by native fishes, such as Chinook Salmon, across different hydrologic conditions and tissues.

Despite increasing environmental concerns regarding nutrient and organic matter-rich effluents, little is known on the effects on adjacent estuarine and coastal food webs. To assess the impact and fate of anthropogenic nitrogen released from aquaculture facilities, we studied water quality and nitrogen (N) flow across an estuarine food web in an estuary in Hainan, China, using nitrogen stable isotopes (δ(15)N). We found higher δ(15)N values of ammonium, nitrate and suspended matter in the pond-covered inner estuary than further upstream, suggesting a strong influence of untreated pond effluents, which had a high δ(15)N (ammonium: ~16‰, nitrate: ~7‰, suspended matter: ~8‰). Fish and benthic invertebrates of the inner estuary had a higher δ(15)N than consumers further upstream and in similar aquaculture-free estuaries elsewhere, most likely due to direct or indirect uptake of (15)N-enriched aquaculture effluents by phytoplankton and benthic algae. A major part of the artisanal catches from the estuary consists of small-size fish which is used as feed in the local aquaculture. Thus, estuarine fish incorporating aquaculture-effluent based food web signals are harvested and recycled as feed in aquaculture facilities, whose effluents sustain this local food web. The δ(15)N being at the high end of the global range on all trophic levels indicates an anthropogenic nitrogen loop in which some portion of the reactive nitrogen initially introduced into aquaculture ponds is continuously recycled and affects the estuarine food web. This recycling also indicates a shortcut in the otherwise inefficient nitrogen sink function of estuaries. Therefore, in areas with large-scale coastal aquaculture like in China and SE Asia the effect of reactive nitrogen from aquaculture sources on the performance of coastal ecosystems may be larger than previously thought.",Animals and Aquaculture and Asia and China and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and *Estuaries and *Nitrogen/analysis and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Ponds,2021/01/02 06:00,S0048-9697(20)37614-2 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144083 [doi],33280879,0330500,0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and N762921K75 (Nitrogen),Netherlands,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Documentation of the links between climate variability, ecosystem change and predator dynamics is absent for most top predators. Identifying species that may be useful indicators and elucidating these mechanistic links provides insight into current ecological dynamics and may inform predictions of future ecosystem responses to climatic change. We examine humpback whale response to environmental variability through stable isotope analysis of diet over a dynamic 20-year period (1993-2012) in the California Current System (CCS). Humpback whale diets captured two major shifts in oceanographic and ecological conditions in the CCS. Isotopic signatures reflect a diet dominated by krill during periods characterized by positive phases of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), cool sea surface temperature (SST), strong upwelling and high krill biomass. In contrast, humpback whale diets are dominated by schooling fish when the NPGO is negative, SST is warmer, seasonal upwelling is delayed and anchovy and sardine populations display increased biomass and range expansion. These findings demonstrate that humpback whales trophically respond to ecosystem shifts, and as a result, their foraging behavior is a synoptic indicator of oceanographic and ecological conditions across the CCS. Multi-decadal examination of these sentinel species thus provides insight into biological consequences of interannual climate fluctuations, fundamental to advancing ecosystem predictions related to global climate change.",Animals and California and *Climate Change and *Diet and *Ecosystem and Female and Food Chain and Humpback Whale/*physiology and Male and Oceans and Seas and Pacific Ocean and Seasons and Temperature,2016/11/03 06:00,10.1111/gcb.13171 [doi],26599719,9888746,NA,England,Published 2015.

Here we used a meta-analytic approach to quantify the magnitude and direction of subsidy inputs across the freshwater-land interface and to determine subsequent responses in recipient animals. Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems differed in the magnitude of subsidies they received, with aquatic ecosystems generally receiving higher subsidies than terrestrial ecosystems. Surprisingly, and despite the large discrepancy in magnitude, the contribution of these subsidies to animal carbon inferred from stable isotope composition did not differ between freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, likely due to the differences in subsidy quality. The contribution of allochthonous subsidies was highest to primary consumers and predators, suggesting that bottom-up and top-down effects may be affected considerably by the input of allochthonous resources.

We use standardized surveys of 54 North American grasslands to test alternate hypotheses predicting 100-fold shifts in the biomass of four common grassland arthropod taxa-Auchenorrhyncha, sucking herbivores, Acrididae, chewing herbivores, Tettigoniidae, omnivores, and Araneae, predators. Bottom-up models predict that consumer biomass tracks plant quantity (e.g. productivity and standing biomass) and quality (nutrient content) and that ectotherm access to food increases with temperature. Each of the focal trophic groups responded differently to these drivers: the biomass of sucking herbivores and omnivores increased with plant biomass; that of chewing herbivores tracked plant quality; and predator biomass did not depend on plant quality, plant quantity or temperature. The Exploitation Ecosystem Hypothesis is a top-down hypothesis that predicts a shift from resource limitation of herbivores when plant production is low, to predator limitation when plant production is high. In grasslands where spider biomass was low, herbivore biomass increased with plant biomass, whereas bottom-up structuring was not evident when spiders were abundant. Furthermore, neither predator biomass nor trophic position (via stable isotope analysis) increased with plant biomass, suggesting predators themselves are top-down limited. Stable isotope analysis revealed that trophic position of the chewing herbivore and omnivore increased significantly with plant biomass, suggesting these groups increased scavenging and meat consumption in grasslands with higher carbohydrate availability.

We use a Bayesian mixing model to quantify the contribution of prey to the diets of local predators, and assess how the structure of trophic interactions changed across space and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a global climatic event that severely impacted mammoth steppe communities. We find that large felids had diets that were more constrained than those of co-occurring predators, and largely influenced by an increase in Rangifer abundance after the LGM.

In light of the warmer temperatures arising with the current climatic changes, omnivorous ectotherms may perform diet shifts toward higher herbivory to optimize energetic intake. Such diet shifts may also occur during heat waves, which are projected to become more frequent, intense, and longer lasting in the future. Here, we investigated how heat waves of different duration affect feeding preferences in omnivorous anuran tadpoles and how these choices affect larval life history. In laboratory experiments, we fed tadpoles of three species on animal, plant, or mixed diet and exposed them to short heat waves (similar to the heat waves these species experience currently) or long heat waves (predicted to increase under climate change). We estimated the dietary choices of tadpoles fed on the mixed diet using stable isotopes and recorded tadpole survival and growth, larval period, and mass at metamorphosis. Tadpole feeding preferences were associated with their thermal background, with herbivory increasing with breeding temperature in nature. Patterns in survival, growth, and development generally support decreased efficiency of carnivorous diets and increased efficiency or higher relative quality of herbivorous diets at higher temperatures. All three species increased herbivory in at least one of the heat wave treatments, but the responses varied among species. Diet shifts toward higher herbivory were maladaptive in one species, but beneficial in the other two. Higher herbivory in omnivorous ectotherms under warmer temperatures may impact species differently and further contribute to changes in the structure and function of freshwater environments.","Adaptation, Physiological and Animals and Anura/*physiology and Diet/veterinary and Herbivory/*physiology and *Hot Temperature and Larva/physiology",2017/06/16 06:00,10.1002/ecy.1541 [doi],27870032,0043541,NA,United States,© 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.,10.1002/ecy.1541 [doi],Discoglossus galganoi and Hyla arborea and Hyla meridionalis and Amphibian and carnivory and climate change and diet regulation and herbivory and omnivory and stable isotope mixing models,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Temperature (Austin). 2017 Mar 7;4(2):117-119.

Using SIP, we successfully identified the active toluene degrader Pigmentiphaga, the single cells of which were subsequently sorted and isolated by RACS. We further successfully assembled the genome of Pigmentiphaga based on the metagenomic sequencing of (13)C-DNA and genomic sequencing of sorted cells, which was confirmed by gyrB gene comparison and average nucleotide identity determination. Additionally, the genotypes and phenotypes of this degrader were directly linked at the single-cell level, and its complete toluene metabolic pathways in petroleum-contaminated soil were reconstructed. Based on its unique metabolic properties uncovered by genome sequencing, we modified the traditional cultivation medium with antibiotics, amino acids, carbon sources, and growth factors (e.g., vitamins and metals), achieving the successful cultivation of RACS-sorted active degrader Pigmentiphaga sp. Our results implied that RACS-SIP-GDC is a state-of-the-art approach for the precise identification, targeted isolation, and cultivation of functional microbes from complex communities in natural habitats. RACS-SIP-GDC can be used to explore specific and targeted organic-pollution-degrading microorganisms at the single-cell level and provide new insights into their biodegradation mechanisms.","*Soil and Isotopes/chemistry and Toluene/metabolism and DNA and *Petroleum and Biodegradation, Environmental and Soil Microbiology",2023/11/08 06:43,10.1021/acs.est.3c04247 [doi],37823365,0213155,0 (Soil) and 0 (Isotopes) and 3FPU23BG52 (Toluene) and 9007-49-2 (DNA) and 0 (Petroleum),United States,NA,10.1021/acs.est.3c04247 [doi],Raman-activated cell sorting and active toluene degrader and genome-directed cultivation and genomic sequencing and stable-isotope probing,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Pond-breeding amphibians can dominate aquatic animal biomass as larvae and are terrestrial prey as juveniles and adults. Thus, amphibians can be vectors of mercury exposure in both aquatic and terrestrial food webs. However, it is still unclear how mercury concentrations are affected by exogenous (e.g., habitat or diet) vs endogenous factors (e.g., catabolism during hibernation) as amphibians undergo large diet shifts and periods of fasting during ontogeny. We measured total mercury (THg), methylmercury (MeHg), and isotopic compositions (δ (13)C, δ(15)N) in boreal chorus frogs (Pseudacris maculata) across five life stages in two Colorado (USA) metapopulations. We found large differences in concentrations and percent MeHg (of THg) among life stages. Frog MeHg concentrations peaked during metamorphosis and hibernation coinciding with the most energetically demanding life cycle stages. Indeed, life history transitions involving periods of fasting coupled with high metabolic demands led to large increases in mercury concentrations. The endogenous processes of metamorphosis and hibernation resulted in MeHg bioamplification, thus decoupling it from the light isotopic proxies of diet and trophic position. These step changes are not often considered in conventional expectations of how MeHg concentrations within organisms are assessed.","Animals and Ponds and *Mercury/analysis and *Methylmercury Compounds/metabolism and Ecosystem and Food Chain and Amphibians/metabolism and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis and Environmental Monitoring and Fishes/metabolism",2023/03/16 06:00,10.1021/acs.est.2c04896 [doi],36848500,0213155,"FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury) and 0 (Methylmercury Compounds) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",United States,NA,10.1021/acs.est.2c04896 [doi],Anuran and Pseudacris maculata and bioaccumulation and biomagnification and boreal chorus frog and contaminant and metamorph and methylmercury and stable isotopes and tadpole,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An enhanced understanding of their ecological roles and trophic interactions in the food webs is fundamental to facilitate resource management for the declining populations in Asia. Foraging information of the Asian species, however, is mainly derived from preliminary, scattered reports from a limited number of study locations. In this study, resource utilization, trophic niche dynamics, and trophic interaction of the juvenile tri-spine horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus (instars 1-12, approximately 0.5-8 years old) across ontogeny was assessed in diversified nursery habitats along the northern Beibu Gulf, China, using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes. Our results suggest that: (i) T. tridentatus are ecological generalists given the vast range of carbon isotopic values and trophic niche width estimates exhibited between multiple instar groups; (ii) juvenile T. tridentatus across most habitat types predominantly assimilated energy from a variety of basal production sources in the food web, but primarily depended on sedimentary organic matter and seagrass resource pools; (iii) ontogenetic shifts in juvenile dietary proportions were evident, with decreased reliance on sedimentary organic matter, coupled with increased reliance on benthic macroinvertebrate grazers, detritivores, and omnivores with age; and (iv) nearly all juvenile instars occupied similar trophic positions in the food web with slight shifts in trophic position present with increasing size.

The objectives of this research were to determine the aquatic food web structure and trophic transfer and accumulation of contaminants within a riverine ecosystem and identify potential stressors to the health of an imperiled fish, the robust redhorse (Moxostoma robustum) and other species of conservation concern in a large Atlantic Slope (USA) river. Trophic position was determined for food web taxa by stable isotope analyses of representative producers, consumers, and organic matter of the Yadkin-Pee Dee River of North Carolina and South Carolina. Contaminant analyses were performed on water, sediment, organic matter, and aquatic biota to assess the prevalence and accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), current use pesticides (CUPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and selected metals. Contaminants were prevalent in the environment and food web components of the river. PCBs were detected in 32% of biotic samples (mean 0.24μg/g dry weight [DW], range 0.01-3.33μg/g DW), and DDTs (legacy OCPs and metabolites) were detected in 90% (mean 0.014μg/g DW, range 0.0004-0.29μg/g DW). The trace metals manganese and cadmium exceeded published threshold effect concentrations in sediment (460 and 0.99μg/g DW, respectively). Mercury was detected in all food web samples exhibiting a mean of 0.61μg/g DW and range 0.006-2.35μg/g DW (mean 0.13μg/g wet weight [WW], range 0.001-0.6μg/g WW). Concentrations exceeded the 0.2μg/g WW aquatic life criterion for mercury in 38% of fish samples. Fish trophic magnification factors (TMFs; range 0.33-3.75) indicated that contaminant accumulation occurred from both water and dietary sources. The combination of analytical approaches applied here provides new insight into contaminant dynamics with conservation implications.","Animals and Cypriniformes/metabolism and Endangered Species and *Food Chain and Geologic Sediments/chemistry and Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated/analysis and Mercury/analysis and North Carolina and Pesticides/analysis and Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons/analysis and Rivers/*chemistry and South Carolina and Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/*metabolism",2018/07/14 06:00,S0048-9697(18)31010-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.03.251 [doi],29758859,0330500,"0 (Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated) and 0 (Pesticides) and 0 (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and DFC2HB4I0K (Polychlorinated Biphenyls) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",Netherlands,Copyright © 2018.

The lower salt marsh (LSM) extends from the mean high tidal level to 35 cm above that level and is followed by the upper salt marsh (USM). Despite changes in the amount of allochthonous marine input and in abiotic conditions, little is known about changes in the trophic structure and used of basal resources by the soil macrofauna along marine-terrestrial boundaries. Natural variations in carbon stable isotope ratios (δ(13)C signatures) allow insight into basal resources of consumers such as marine algae, terrestrial C3 and C4 photosynthesising plants. Furthermore, variations in nitrogen stable isotope ratios (δ(15)N signatures) allow insight into the trophic position of consumers. We investigated spatial and temporal changes in stable isotope signatures in salt marsh soil macrofauna of the island of Spiekeroog, German Wadden Sea. The range of δ(15)N signatures indicated no changes in food chain length across salt marsh zones with consumers in both zones comprising primary decomposers, secondary decomposers and first order predators. However, the trophic position of individual species changed between zones, but in particular with season. Contrasting δ(15)N signatures, the range in δ(13)C signatures in the LSM was twice that in the USM indicating a wider range of resources consumed. Bayesian mixing models indicated predominant autochthonous resource use in both the LSM and USM, with the use of marine allochthonous resources never exceeding 29.6%. However, the models also indicate an increase in the use of marine resources in certain species in the LSM with no use in the USM. Overall, the results indicate that the resource use of salt marsh macrofauna varies more in space than in time, with the food web being generally based on autochthonous rather than allochthonous resources. However, there also is trophic plasticity in certain species across both temporal and spatial scales including variations in the use of allochthonous resources. Generally, however, marine input contributes little to the nutrition of salt marsh soil macroinvertebrates.",Bayes Theorem and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Food Chain and Nitrogen Isotopes and Plants and *Soil and *Wetlands,2022/06/30 06:00,10.1186/s12862-022-02039-0 [pii] and 2039 [pii] and 10.1186/s12862-022-02039-0 [doi],35761170,101775613,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Soil),England,© 2022.

For laboratory-raised and wild-collected plant-invertebrate food chains spanning four trophic levels we estimated nitrogen range (NR) using δ(15)N, and carbon range (CR) using δ(13)C, which are used to quantify food chain length and breadth of trophic resources respectively. Across a range of known food chain lengths we examined how NR and CR changed within and between food chains. Our isotopic estimates of structure are robust because they were calculated using resampling procedures that propagate variance in sample means through to quantified uncertainty in final estimates. To identify origins of uncertainty in estimates of NR and CR, we additionally examined variation in discrimination (which is change in δ(15)N or δ(13)C from source to consumer) between trophic levels and among food chains. δ(15)N discrimination showed significant enrichment, while variation in enrichment was species and system specific, ranged broadly (1.4‰ to 3.3‰), and importantly, propagated variation to subsequent estimates of NR. However, NR proved robust to such variation and distinguished food chain length well, though some overlap between longer food chains infers a need for awareness of such limitations. δ(13)C discrimination was inconsistent; generally no change or small significant enrichment was observed. Consequently, estimates of CR changed little with increasing food chain length, showing the potential utility of δ(13)C as a tracer of energy pathways. This study serves as a robust test of isotopic quantification of food chain structure, and given global estimates of aquatic food chains approximate four trophic levels while many food chains include invertebrates, our use of four trophic level plant-invertebrate food chains makes our findings relevant for a majority of ecological systems.",Animals and Aphids/parasitology/*physiology and Carbon Isotopes/metabolism and Diptera/parasitology/*physiology and Ecosystem and *Food Chain and Hymenoptera/*physiology and Larva/parasitology/physiology and Nitrogen Isotopes/metabolism and Triticum/growth & development/parasitology and Zea mays/growth & development/parasitology,2015/05/29 06:00,PONE-D-13-35964 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0093281 [doi],24676331,101285081,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0093281 [doi] and e93281,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC3968125,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While the archaeological evidence points to a largely pastoral lifestyle, knowledge regarding the general composition of human diets and their variation across landscapes and during the different phases of the Bronze Age is still restricted. Human and animal skeletal remains from the burial mounds that dominate the archaeological landscape and their stable isotope compositions are major sources of dietary information. Here, we present stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data of bone collagen of 105 human and 50 animal individuals from the 5th millennium BC to the Sarmatian period, with a strong focus on the Bronze Age and its cultural units including Maykop, Yamnaya, Novotitorovskaya, North Caucasian, Catacomb, post-Catacomb and late Bronze Age groups. The samples comprise all inhumations with sufficient bone preservation from five burial mound sites and a flat grave cemetery as well as subsamples from three further sites. They represent the Caucasus Mountains in the south, the piedmont zone and Kuban steppe with humid steppe and forest vegetation to its north, and more arid regions in the Caspian steppe. The stable isotope compositions of the bone collagen of humans and animals varied across the study area and reflect regional diversity in environmental conditions and diets. The data agree with meat, milk, and/or dairy products from domesticated herbivores, especially from sheep and goats having contributed substantially to human diets, as it is common for a largely pastoral economy. This observation is also in correspondence with the faunal remains observed in the graves and offerings of animals in the mound shells. In addition, foodstuffs with elevated carbon and nitrogen isotope values, such as meat of unweaned animals, fish, or plants, also contributed to human diets, especially among communities living in the more arid landscapes.

Conventional radioecological models are largely based on equilibrium and empirical relationships with reasonable data requirements, making them practical tools for long-term assessments. But conventional models may be inadequate to simulate radionuclide dynamics in terrestrial environments realistically. Specifically, the structure of such models seldom conforms to the physics of water flow and solute transport in soils. The equilibrium relationships may fail to predict seasonality in radionuclide transfer between environmental compartments; model transferability between sites is often hampered by its empirical nature. Numerous studies have highlighted the need to circumvent these limitations. In this paper, we introduce dynamic and process-based modelling to a conventional radioecological model by coupling an empirical plant module to a process-based soil module that simulates water flow, solute transport and root uptake in the soil column. Illustrative simulations are presented using the coupled model and stable chlorine cycling in a temperate Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand as an example. The model satisfactorily reproduced soil moisture dynamics and the inventory of inorganic chlorine in the tree and forest floor compartments. The inventory of organic chlorine in the stand, however, was overestimated, indicating that processes pertinent to organochlorine cycling at the stand were missing from the model. The approach proposed in this paper is a step towards dynamic and process-based modelling in terrestrial radioecology and impact assessment. It can be particularly useful for modelling transfer of elements, such as redox-sensitive radionuclides, whose behaviour in soil-plant systems is moisture-dependent.","Models, Chemical and Pinus sylvestris and *Radiation Monitoring and Radioisotopes and Soil and Soil Pollutants, Radioactive/*analysis and Trees",2021/01/28 06:00,S0265-931X(20)30447-1 [pii] and 10.1016/j.jenvrad.2020.106380 [doi],33011600,8508119,"0 (Radioisotopes) and 0 (Soil) and 0 (Soil Pollutants, Radioactive)",England,Copyright © 2020.

We collected soil, rice plants, aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, small wild fish, and resident songbird feathers from an Hg-contaminated rice paddy ecosystem for an analysis of stable Hg isotopes to clarify the sources of Hg and its transfer in songbirds and their prey. Significant mass-dependent fractionation (MDF, δ(202)Hg), but no mass-independent fractionation (MIF, ∆(199)Hg) occurred in the trophic transfers in terrestrial food chains. Piscivorous, granivorous, and frugivorous songbirds and aquatic invertebrates were all characterized by elevated Δ(199)Hg values. The estimated MeHg isotopic compositions obtained using linear fitting and a binary mixing model explained both the terrestrial and aquatic origins of MeHg in the terrestrial food chains. We found that MeHg from aquatic habitats is an important subsidy for terrestrial songbirds, even those that feed mainly on seeds, fruits, or cereals. The results show that MIF of the MeHg isotope is a reliable tool to reveal MeHg sources in songbirds. Because the MeHg isotopic compositions was calculated with a binary mixing model or directly estimated from the high proportions of MeHg, compound-specific isotope analysis of Hg would be more useful for the interpretation of the Hg sources, and is highly recommended for future studies.","Animals and *Methylmercury Compounds and Mercury Isotopes/analysis and Ecosystem and *Songbirds and *Mercury/analysis and Invertebrates and Food Chain and Isotopes and Environmental Monitoring/methods and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2023/05/29 06:42,S0048-9697(23)01836-3 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163217 [doi],37011675,0330500,"0 (Methylmercury Compounds) and 0 (Mercury Isotopes) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury) and 0 (Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",Netherlands,Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

The coastal waters of Jiangsu are one of the important fishing bases in China. In recent years, with the development of industry in the coastal waters of Jiangsu, heavy metal (HM) pollution in this region has become more serious. In this study, all samples (including macroalgae, bivalves, cephalopods, gastropods, crustaceans and fish) were collected in the coastal waters of Jiangsu in spring, summer and autumn. Based on the construction of the food web structure using carbon and nitrogen isotope technology, the main methods of material circulation and energy flow were quantified, and the accumulation regularity and seasonal variation characteristics of HMs in the food web were analysed. The results showed that (1) among all the trophic groups, bivalves had the highest enrichment level of HMs, while fish had the lowest. However, fish have a strong ability to enrich Hg, and the main source of Hg enrichment in the human body is edible fish, so more attention should be given to Hg concentrations in fish. (2) In spring, the mean HM concentrations of marine organisms in the coastal waters of Jiangsu were Zn > Cu > As > Cd > Cr > Pb > Ni > Hg, and they were Zn > Cu > As > Pb > Cd > Ni > Cr > Hg in summer and Zn > Cu > As > Pb > Cd > Cr > Ni > Hg in autumn. In total, the concentrations of Zn, Cu and As were the highest, while the mean concentration of Hg in organisms was the lowest. (3) No significant biomagnification of HMs was found in the three seasons. We speculated that overfishing leads to miniaturization and a younger age of organisms, which makes the concentration of highly enriched HMs in organisms with high trophic levels (TLs) lower.","Animals and Carbon and China and Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and Fisheries and Food Chain and Humans and Hunting and *Metals, Heavy/analysis and Nitrogen Isotopes and Risk Assessment and Seasons and Technology and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2022/01/28 06:00,S0269-7491(21)02231-4 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118649 [doi],34902527,8804476,"0 (Metals, Heavy) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and 7440-44-0 (Carbon)",England,Copyright © 2021.

A number of anthropogenic pressures are impacting species diversity in inland waters and, amongst them, the spread of invasive alien species is considered one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss and homogenisation in freshwater habitats.Crayfish species are widely distributed freshwater invaders and, while alien species introductions occur mostly accidentally, alien crayfish are often released deliberately into new areas for commercial purposes. After their initial introduction, crayfish species can rapidly establish and reach high-density populations as a result of their adaptive functional traits, such as their generalist diet.The Louisiana crayfish Procambarusclarkii (Girard, 1852) is globally considered one of the worst invaders and its impact on recipient freshwater communities can vary from predation and competition with native species, to modification of food webs and habitat structure and introduction of pathogens. Native to the south United States and north Mexico, P.clarkii has been introduced in Europe, Asia and Africa, determining negative ecological and economic impacts in the majority of invaded habitats where it became dominant within the receiving benthic food webs. Due to its flexible feeding strategy, P.clarkii exerts adverse effects at different trophic levels, ultimately affecting the structure and dynamics of invaded food webs. It is, therefore, paramount to evaluate the ecological consequences of P.clarkii invasion and to quantify its impact in a spatially explicit context. NEW INFORMATION: In the past decades, the analysis of stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and other elements has become a popular methodology in food web ecology. Notably, stable isotope analysis has emerged as a primary tool for addressing applied issues in biodiversity conservation and management, such as the assessment of the trophic ecology of non-indigenous species in invaded habitats. Here, we built two geo-referenced datasets, resolved respectively at the population and individual scale, by collating information on δ(13)C and δ(15)N values of P.clarkii within invaded inland waters. The population-scale dataset consists of 160 carbon and nitrogen isotopic values of the Louisiana crayfish and its potential prey, including living and non-living primary producers and benthic invertebrates. The dataset resolved at individual scale consists of 1,168 isotopic records of P.clarkii. The isotopic values included within the two datasets were gathered from 10 countries located in Europe, Asia, Africa and North America, for a total of 41 studies published between 2005 and 2021. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this effort represents the first attempt to collate in standardised datasets the sparse isotopic information of P.clarkii available in literature.

Microorganisms play an important role in remediating V contamination by reducing more toxic and mobile vanadate (V(V)) to less toxic and mobile V(IV). In this study, DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) coupled with metagenomic-binning was used to identify microorganisms responsible for V(V) reduction and determine potential metabolic mechanisms in cultures inoculated with a V-contaminated river sediment. Anaeromyxobacter and Geobacter spp. were identified as putative V(V)-reducing bacteria, while Methanosarcina spp. were identified as putative V(V)-reducing archaea. The bacteria may use the two nitrate reductases NarG and NapA for respiratory V(V) reduction, as has been demonstrated previously for other species. It is proposed that Methanosarcina spp. may reduce V(V) via anaerobic methane oxidation pathways (AOM-V) rather than via respiratory V(V) reduction performed by their bacterial counterparts, as indicated by the presence of genes associated with anaerobic methane oxidation coupled with metal reduction in the metagenome assembled genome (MAG) of Methanosarcina. Briefly, methane may be oxidized through the ""reverse methanogenesis"" pathway to produce electrons, which may be further captured by V(V) to promote V(V) reduction. More specially, V(V) reduction by members of Methanosarcina may be driven by electron transport (CoMS-SCoB heterodisulfide reductase (HdrDE), F(420)H(2) dehydrogenases (Fpo), and multi-heme c-type cytochrome (MHC)).

In this study, we coupled magnetic-nanoparticle mediated isolation (MMI) and DNA-SIP, namely MMI-SIP, to identify the active microbes involved in phenanthrene degradation from PAH-contaminated wastewater. Microbes affiliated to Pseudomonas and Sphingobium were responsible for in situ phenanthrene metabolism from the SIP results, and Pigmentiphaga was only unraveled for phenanthrene degradation in the MMI and MMI-SIP microcosms. MMI-SIP also significantly increased the enrichment of the above microbes and genes encoding the alpha subunit of the PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase (PAH-RHD(α)) in the heavy DNA fractions. Our findings suggest that MMI-SIP is a powerful tool, with higher resolution and accuracy, to distinguish the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism in the wastewater, provide a more precise map of functional microbial communities, and offer suggestions for effective management for wastewater treatment plants.","Bacteriological Techniques/instrumentation/*methods and Biodegradation, Environmental and Carbon Isotopes and High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing and Isotope Labeling and Isotopes and Magnetics and Nanoparticles/chemistry and Phenanthrenes/*metabolism and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons/chemistry/metabolism and Pseudomonas/genetics/*isolation & purification/metabolism and Sphingomonadaceae/genetics/*isolation & purification/metabolism and Wastewater/chemistry/*microbiology and Water Microbiology and Water Pollutants, Chemical/metabolism",2019/01/01 06:00,S0043-1354(18)30579-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.watres.2018.07.036 [doi],30032019,0105072,"0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Isotopes) and 0 (Phenanthrenes) and 0 (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) and 0 (Waste Water) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",England,Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Although much is known about trophic transfer of MeHg in aquatic food webs at temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere, it is unclear whether its fate is similar in biota from coastal zones of the southeastern Pacific. To assess this gap, MeHg, total Hg and food web structure (using δ(13)C and δ(15)N) were measured in marine macroinvertebrates, fishes, birds, and mammals from Patagonian fjords and the Antarctic Peninsula. Trophic magnification slopes (TMS; log MeHg versus δ(15)N) for coastal food webs of Patagonia were high when compared with studies in the northern hemisphere, and significantly higher near freshwater inputs as compared to offshore sites (0.244 vs 0.192). Similarly, in Antarctica, the site closer to glacial inputs had a significantly higher TMS than the one in the Southern Shetland Islands (0.132 vs 0.073). Composition of the food web also had an influence, as the TMS increased when mammals and seabirds were excluded (0.132-0.221) at a coastal site. This study found that both the composition of the food web and the proximity to freshwater outflows are key factors influencing the TMS for MeHg in Patagonian and Antarctic food webs.","Animals and Antarctic Regions and Bioaccumulation and Biota and *Environmental Monitoring and Estuaries and Fishes and *Food Chain and Fresh Water and Humans and Mercury/analysis and Methylmercury Compounds/*analysis and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*analysis",2020/11/18 06:00,S0045-6535(20)32555-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128360 [doi],33182080,0320657,"0 (Methylmercury Compounds) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",England,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Fecal bacterial communities were dominated by relatively few taxa, mostly belonging to phyla Fusobacteriota and Firmicutes. Members of parasite-associated phyla Nematoda, Acanthocephala and Platyhelminthes were prevalent in our study population. We hypothesized that high versus low prey trophic level (e.g. fish versus bivalves) would result in different gut bacterial and macroparasite communities. We found that bacterial community structure correlated to diet, with nine clades enriched in walruses consuming higher-trophic-level prey. While no parasite compositional differences were found at the phylum level, the cestode genus Diphyllobothrium was more prevalent and abundant in walruses consuming higher-trophic-level prey, probably because fish are the intermediate hosts for this genus.

There is, however, a shift toward the use of C3 (non-maize) foods during the last prehistoric period (AD 1300-1450), which is likely related to environmental stress and social disruption.

We used a system of semi-natural mesocosms housing a variety of invertebrate species and in which climatic conditions were manipulated. Lizards in warmer climatic conditions ate at a greater predatory to phytophagous invertebrate ratio and had smaller individual dietary breadths.

Similarly, there are no studies addressing how forestry related disturbances to the structure of headwater food webs manifest (accumulate/dissipate) downstream and/or whether forest management alters natural longitudinal trends predicted by the RCC. Using stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen, we investigated how: 1) autochthony in macroinvertebrates and fish change from small streams to larger downstream sites within a basin with minimal forest management (New Brunswick, Canada); 2) longitudinal trends in autochthony and food web length compare among three basins with different forest management intensity [intensive (harvest and replanting), extensive (harvest only), minimal] to detect potential cumulative/dissipative effects; and 3) forest management intensity and other catchment variables are influencing food web dynamics. We showed that, as predicted, the reliance of some macroinvertebrate taxa (especially collector feeders) on algae increased from small streams to downstream waters in the minimally managed basin, but that autochthony in the smallest shaded stream was higher than expected based on the RCC (as high as 90% for some taxa). However, this longitudinal increase in autochthony was not observed within the extensively managed basin and was weaker within the intensively managed one, suggesting that forest management can alter food web dynamics along the river continuum. The dampening of downstream autochthony indicates that the increased allochthony observed in small streams in response to forest harvesting cumulates downstream through the river continuum.

The variability of traits, however, is often difficult to trace back in nature. Here, we analyzed stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in muscle samples of 88 S. chinensis stranded in the PRE from 2004 to 2016 to investigate the ecological changes occurring in the dolphins. Stable isotope analysis revealed the existence of two sub-aggregations of S. chinensis in the PRE. Generalized additive models showed significant decreasing trends in both carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures over time, indicating the habitat changes and dietary shifts, possibly due to the influence of increased coastal developments and fishing activities in the PRE. Diet modeling suggests that the proportional contribution of higher trophic-level prey decreased in the S. chinensis diet over time, while increased consumption of lower trophic-level prey was observed. This shift was related to depletion of higher trophic-level prey caused by overfishing. Although S. chinensis could temporarily compensate for the lost energy supply through feeding plasticity (revealed by the negligible differences of isotope niche width among different stranding periods), long-term depletion in prey availability may cause long-lasting negative effects on this dolphin population. This study highlights the crucial relationships between fishery management and dolphin conservation, providing scientific evidence for the long-term protection of this threatened species in the PRE region.",Animals and Conservation of Natural Resources/*methods and Diet/statistics & numerical data and *Dolphins and *Ecosystem and Endangered Species and *Estuaries and Isotopes,2018/11/16 06:00,S0048-9697(18)33700-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.09.256 [doi],30266048,0330500,0 (Isotopes),Netherlands,Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Few studies have examined the influence of diet on FR profiles in nestling raptors and the possible physiological implications of such FR exposure. The objectives of this research were (1) to determine spatial patterns of ≤ 48 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners and ≤ 26 non-PBDE FRs, including organophosphate esters (OPEs), in nestling peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) across the Canadian Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin (GL-SLR; 2010) and in the eastern Canadian Arctic (2007); (2) to identify temporal changes in FR concentrations from the mid-2000s to 2010 in GL-SLR peregrine nestlings; (3) to investigate the role of diet using stable isotopes on exposure patterns of quantifiable FRs; and (4) to assess possible associations between circulating FRs and total (T) thyroxine (TT(4)) and triiodothyronine (TT(3)), tocopherol, retinol and oxidative status (isoprostanes). The summed concentrations of the top 5 PBDEs (Σ(5)) (BDE-47, -99, -100, -154, -153) were significantly higher in rural nestlings than urban nestlings in the GL-SLR, followed by the eastern Arctic nestlings. The PBDE congener profile of rural nestlings was dominated by BDE-99 (34‰), whereas BDE-209 (31‰) became dominant in the 2010 urban PBDE profile marking a shift since the mid-2000s. Low (ppb) concentrations of 25 novel non-PBDE FRs (e.g., 1,2-bis-(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE), decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE)) were measured in the nestlings in at least one region, with the first report in peregrines of 15 novel non-PBDE FRs (e.g., 2-ethyl-1-hyxyl 2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (EHTBB), pentabromo allyl ether (PBPAE), tetrabromoethylcyclohexane (α-, β-DBE-DBCH)) as well as of tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) (0-7.5ng/g ww) > tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) (0.1-5.5ng/g ww) > tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) (0.02-2.0ng/g ww) > tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) (0-1.0ng/g ww). Within the GL-SLR, the urban nestlings' diet had significantly more terrestrial sources (greater δ(13)C values) than the broader, more aquatic-based diet of rural peregrines. Dietary source (δ(13)C) was significantly associated with concentrations of Σ(5)PBDE, BDE-209, EHTBB, and 2,2-4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl (BB-153), with trophic level (δ(15)N) also positively associated with BDE-209 levels. Compared to urban nestlings, the rural nestlings had significantly lower circulating concentrations of thyroxine (TT(4)), triiodothyronine (TT(3)), a greater proportion of TT(3) relative to TT(4) (TT(3):TT(4)), tocopherol and oxidative status (isoprostanes), but higher retinol levels; the most recalcitrant PBDE congener, BDE-153, in combination with low concentrations of some novel FRs, particularly octabromotrimethylphenyllindane (OBIND), may influence circulating thyroid hormones, especially TT(4), and retinol levels of peregrine falcon nestlings.

The bulk of past work has been conducted on large herbivorous mammals. One important finding is that their dietary habits of fossil large mammals track the late Miocene ecological shift from C3 forest and woodland to C4 savannah. However, few studies on carbon isotopes of fossil small mammals exist due to limitations imposed by the size of rodent teeth, and the isotopic ecological and dietary behaviors of small mammals to climate change remain unknown. Here we evaluate the impact of ecological change on small mammals by fine-scale comparisons of carbon isotope ratios (δ(13)C) with dental morphology of murine rodents, spanning 13.8 to ∼2.0 Ma, across the C3 to C4 vegetation shift in the Miocene Siwalik sequence of Pakistan. We applied in-situ laser ablation GC-IRMS to lower first molars and measured two grazing indices on upper first molars. Murine rodents yield a distinct, but related, record of past ecological conditions from large herbivorous mammals, reflecting available foods in their much smaller home ranges. In general, larger murine species show more positive δ(13)C values and have higher grazing indices than smaller species inhabiting the same area at any given age. Two clades of murine rodents experienced different rates of morphological change. In the faster-evolving clade, the timing and trend of morphological innovations are closely tied to consumption of C4 diet during the vegetation shift. This study provides quantitative evidence of linkages among diet, niche partitioning, and dental morphology at a more detailed level than previously possible.","Adaptation, Biological and Animals and Carbon Isotopes/*analysis and Climate Change and *Ecosystem and *Feeding Behavior and *Fossils and Mice and Pakistan and Rats and Tooth/*anatomy & histology",2014/04/29 06:00,PONE-D-13-08098 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0069308 [doi],23936324,101285081,0 (Carbon Isotopes),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0069308 [doi] and e69308,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC3732283,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Riparian spiders that predate on emergent aquatic invertebrates can contribute to carbon flux and the structure of aquatic and riparian food webs. The impact of riparian degradation on spiders in temperate rivers of Australia and their role in this broader ecosystem function is poorly understood. We surveyed the riparian zone of four rivers of south-western Australia in areas of natural intact vegetation and degraded agricultural land to explore whether riparian spider abundance, and diversity may be affected by changes to riparian condition. We also assessed the impact of the riparian condition on carbon fluxes between aquatic and terrestrial environments, using stable isotope analysis. We found overall abundance of riparian spiders was higher in degraded agricultural sites compared to natural intact sites and the structure of spider assemblages was different. Orb-weaver spiders (Araneidae and Tetragnathidae) were found to be more abundant in agricultural areas where canopy cover and understory are sparse as a result of livestock grazing and trampling. The contribution of carbon from aquatic invertebrates in a natural intact site was 48.5% for Orb-weavers and 41.6% for Cursorial Hunter spiders but reduced to 19.6% and 39.9% respectively in a degraded agricultural site.

We analyzed stable isotope ratios in skin and fatty acid signatures in blubber samples of whales, as well as in seven potential prey species, and diet was quantitatively assessed using Bayesian isotopic models. An abrupt change in fin whale dietary niche coincided with a decrease in biomass of their predominant prey, Arctic krill (Thysanoessa spp.). This dietary niche widening toward generalist diets occurred in nearly 60% of sampled individuals. The fin whale population, typically composed of specialists of either krill or lipid-rich pelagic fishes, shifted toward one composed either of krill specialists or true generalists feeding on various zooplankton and fish prey.

While ants occupy a wide range of positions in food webs, and ant community composition changes with habitat, it is not well understood if ant genera tend to maintain their position in the trophic structure, or if trophic position varies across habitats. 2. We used ratios of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to test for differences in the trophic structure and position of assemblages of ants among habitat types. We tested for differences between assemblages in replicate sites of the land use categories: (i) pastures with old large trees; (ii) recently revegetated pastures with small young trees; and (iii) remnant woodlands. Known insect herbivores and predatory spiders provided baselines for herbivorous and predaceous arthropods. Soil samples were used to correct for the base level of isotopic enrichment at each site. 3. We found no significant interactions between land use and ant genus for isotope enrichment, indicating that trophic structure is conserved across land use categories. The fixed relative positions of genera in the trophic structure might be re-enforced by competition or some other factor. However, the entire ant assemblage had significantly lower δ(15) N values in revegetated sites, suggesting that ants feed lower down in the food chain i.e. they are more 'herbivorous' in revegetated sites. This may be a result of the high availability of plant sugars, honeydew and herbivorous arthropod prey. 4. Surprisingly, ants in remnants and pastures with trees displayed similar isotopic compositions. Interactions within ant assemblages are thus likely to be resilient to changes in land use, but ant diets in early successional habitats may reflect the simplicity of communities, which may have comparatively lower rates of saprophagy and predation.",Animals and Ants/chemistry/*physiology and Carbon Isotopes/chemistry/metabolism and *Food Chain and Nitrogen Isotopes/chemistry/metabolism and Soil/chemistry and Spiders and Trees,2011/04/13 06:00,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01747.x [doi],20831728,0376574,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Soil),England,© 2010 The Authors.

Empirical data on the integration of ecosystem engineers and food webs is however largely lacking. This paper investigates the hypothesised link based on a field sampling approach of intertidal biogenic aggregations created by the ecosystem engineer Lanice conchilega (Polychaeta, Terebellidae). The aggregations are known to have a considerable impact on the physical and biogeochemical characteristics of their environment and subsequently on the abundance and biomass of primary food sources and the macrofaunal (i.e. the macro-, hyper- and epibenthos) community. Therefore, we hypothesise that L. conchilega aggregations affect the structure, stability and isotopic niche of the consumer assemblage of a soft-bottom intertidal food web. Primary food sources and the bentho-pelagic consumer assemblage of a L. conchilega aggregation and a control area were sampled on two soft-bottom intertidal areas along the French coast and analysed for their stable isotopes. Despite the structural impacts of the ecosystem engineer on the associated macrofaunal community, the presence of L. conchilega aggregations only has a minor effect on the food web structure of soft-bottom intertidal areas. The isotopic niche width of the consumer communities of the L. conchilega aggregations and control areas are highly similar, implying that consumer taxa do not shift their diet when feeding in a L. conchilega aggregation. Besides, species packing and hence trophic redundancy were not affected, pointing to an unaltered stability of the food web in the presence of L. conchilega.","Algorithms and Animals and Aquatic Organisms/physiology and Biomass and Carbon Isotopes/metabolism and Conservation of Natural Resources/methods and *Ecological and Environmental Phenomena and *Ecosystem and *Food Chain and France and Geography and Models, Theoretical and Nitrogen Isotopes/metabolism and Oceans and Seas and Polychaeta/*physiology",2016/06/16 06:00,PONE-D-15-25481 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0140857 [doi],26496349,101285081,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0140857 [doi] and e0140857,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC4619716,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We explored the influence of climate on stem growth and stable isotopes for Polylepis tarapacana Philipi, the world's highest elevation tree species, which is found only in the South American Altiplano. We developed tree-ring width index (RWI), oxygen (δ18O) and carbon (δ13C) chronologies for the last 60 years at four P. tarapacana stands located above 4400 m in elevation, along a 500 km latitude aridity gradient. Total annual precipitation decreased from 300 to 200 mm from the northern to the southern sites. We used RWI as a proxy of wood formation (carbon sink) and isotopic tree-ring signatures as proxies of leaf-level gas exchange processes (carbon source). We found distinct climatic conditions regulating carbon sink processes along the gradient. Current growing-season temperature regulated RWI at northern-wetter sites, while prior growing-season precipitation determined RWI at arid southern sites. This suggests that the relative importance of temperature to precipitation in regulating tree growth is driven by site water availability. By contrast, warm and dry growing seasons resulted in enriched tree-ring δ13C and δ18O at all study sites, suggesting that similar climate conditions control carbon-source processes along the gradient. Site-level δ13C and δ18O chronologies were significantly and positively related at all sites, with the strongest relationships among the southern drier stands. This indicates an overall regulation of intercellular carbon dioxide via stomatal conductance for the entire P. tarapacana network, with greater stomatal control when aridity increases. This manuscript also highlights a coupling (decoupling) between physiological processes at leaf level and wood formation as a function of similarities (differences) in their climatic sensitivity. This study contributes to a better understanding and prediction of the response of high-elevation Polylepis woodlands to rapid climate changes and projected drying in the Altiplano.",Carbon Isotopes/analysis and *Forests and Oxygen Isotopes/analysis and *Trees and Wood/chemistry,2021/10/16 06:00,6144557 [pii] and 10.1093/treephys/tpab021 [doi],33601406,100955338,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Oxygen Isotopes),Canada,"© The Author(s) 2021.

Variability in carbon and nitrogen isotope composition (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) among consumers can provide information on the population trophic niche and how it may change in response to environmental stress. We measured δ(13)C and δ(15)N values in primary producers and in an ecosystem engineer, the bioturbating sandprawn Kraussillichirus kraussi, in Langebaan Lagoon, South Africa, along a human disturbance gradient. Diet partitioning mixing models were coupled with isotope niche analyses and individual body condition data to investigate shifts in resource utilisation and diet plasticity from minimally to highly disturbed sites. The δ(15)N values of seagrass, Zostera capensis indicated a nutrient gradient, with the highest δ(15)N values at highly disturbed sites indicating either anthropogenic or marine nitrogen inputs. A decreasing δ(15)N signal with distance from human disturbance/mouth of lagoon was however not evident for sandprawns nor their presumed dietary sources (phytoplankton, microphytobenthos or sediment organic matter), likely because of faster isotope turnover time compared to seagrass and/or differential fractionation for sandprawns among the sites. Sandprawn isotope niche sizes varied among sites, with no trend along the disturbance gradient. The smallest niche coincided with uniform feeding on microphytobenthos according to mixing models. On an individual level, deviating isotope values from population means were correlated to better body condition, suggesting that a divergent feeding strategy is beneficial.

A notable example is shallow lakes where human-induced eutrophication or water level fluctuation may result in a switch from a clear-water, macrophyte-dominated state to a turbid, phytoplankton-dominated state. Yet, few investigations have described synchronous changes in biotic assemblage composition and food web framework under such a shift between alternative states. We used stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes to test the extent to which switching from macrophyte to phytoplankton dominance in Lake Gucheng, triggered by a water level increase, would alter ecosystem structure and change the basal resources supporting the food web. We found that invertebrates and fish compensated for a reduction of macrophyte and epiphyte resources by deriving more energy from the alternative pelagic energy channel, where benthic invertebrates act as crucial links between primary producers and higher consumers by transporting δ(13)C-depleted pelagic algae to the benthic zone.

Two physically similar lakes, East Lake and West Lake at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory on Melville Island, Nunavut, Canada are being affected by climate change differently. Both lakes have experienced permafrost degradation in their catchments; however, West Lake has also undergone multiple underwater Mass Movement Events (MMEs; beginning in fall 2008), leading to a sustained 50-fold increase in turbidity. This provided the unique opportunity to understand the potential impacts of permafrost degradation and other climate-related effects on Hg concentrations and body condition of landlocked Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), an important sentinel species across the Circum-Arctic. Our objectives were to assess temporal trends in char Hg concentrations and to determine potential mechanisms driving the trends. There was a significant decrease in Hg concentrations in East Lake char, averaging 6.5%/year and 3.8%/year for length-adjusted and age-adjusted means, respectively, from 2008 to 2019. Conversely, in West Lake there was a significant increase, averaging 7.9%/year and 8.0%/year for length-adjusted and age-adjusted mean Hg concentrations, respectively, for 2009 to 2017 (the last year with sufficient sample size). The best predictors of length-adjusted Hg concentrations in West Lake were carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios, indicating a shift in diet including possible dietary starvation brought on by the profound increase in lake turbidity. Our study provides an example of how increasing lake turbidity, a likely consequence of climate warming in Arctic lakes, may influence fish condition and Hg concentrations.

Among these invaders, the introduction of the European perch (Perca fluviatilis) can have particularly detrimental effects on native communities, affecting both ecosystem functioning and human well-being. In this study, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis was employed, using perch originating from five different ecosystems, to model the effects of their hypothetical introduction into İznik Lake, an economically and ecologically important, biodiversity-rich lake in northern Turkey, to ultimately assess their potential predation impact and competition with native predators. The results revealed that if perch were introduced to the community, they would - considering gape size limitations - primarily prey upon Vimba vimba and Rutilus rutilus, indicating a significant feeding pressure on these species. Furthermore, the study identified a potential overlap and competition for resources between commonly mesopredator perch and the European catfish Silurus glanis, the current top predator in the ecosystem. Both species would occupy top predatory positions, emphasizing the potential disruption of predator-prey dynamics. Our findings underscore the potential ecological repercussions of perch invasions. The selective predation on V. vimba and R. rutilus, with the latter being consumed to a lesser extent by perch, could lead to cascading effects throughout the food web, altering the community structure, and ecosystem dynamics. Additionally, the competition between perch and S. glanis raises concerns about effects on the stability and functioning of the fish community. These results highlight the need for proactive management strategies to mitigate the risk of perch introductions. Strict regulations on the movement and introduction of invasive species, along with comprehensive monitoring, are crucial for preserving native communities and maintaining the ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems. Our study demonstrates the potential predation impact of perch on vulnerable fish species and the competition with the established apex predator, emphasizing the importance of considering the ecological consequences of perch invasions and informing management decisions to ensure the conservation and sustainability of aquatic ecosystems.",Animals and Humans and *Perches and Lakes and Ecosystem and *Cyprinidae and *Catfishes and Introduced Species and Nitrogen Isotopes and Predatory Behavior,2023/10/23 01:18,10.1038/s41598-023-44865-2 [pii] and 44865 [pii] and 10.1038/s41598-023-44865-2 [doi],37848487,101563288,0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),England,© 2023.

BC) to expand our understanding of the different roles of rice and millets to human subsistence strategies, diachronic shift of human diets, diversity of human life histories and cultural influence (dental ablation) to human population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Carbon and nitrogen isotopic analyses of human (ribs and long bones, n = 68) and animal (n = 15) bones as well as carbonized seeds from rice and millets (n = 8) were undertaken. Human bones were directly AMS-(14) C dated. In addition, sequential sampling of 16 individuals with varied age and sex and cultural contexts for isotopic analysis was also conducted. RESULTS: The calibrated dating results (n = 27) indicate that there existed two periods of occupation at the site, ~2500-2200 BC and ~2200-1900 BC. Moderate high δ(15) N values were found in the crops. Isotopic data from bone collagen suggest that the humans mainly relied on C(3) -based animal protein and were supplemented by C(4) -based foods. This isotopic pattern is also seen in pigs. Significant difference of human δ(13) C values (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05) between the two periods was observed. Compared to the bones, the isotopic data of human dentine serial sections show a much wider variability and higher δ(13) C values. DISCUSSION: The crops (millets and rice) were probably manured. Human individuals subsisted on rice/millet agriculture and pigs in general. In combination with the radiocarbon dates, the increase of C(3) (rice) consumption by the humans was found from the early (2500-2200 cal. BC) to late (2200-2000 cal. BC) periods, indicating the intensification of rice agriculture through time. However, four categories of human life histories during childhood are identified given different isotopic profiles of dentine sections, demonstrating that C(3) (rice) and C(4) (millets)-based foods played different roles in human lives. Even though, there were similar weaning practices among the human populations. It is surprising that human individuals with dental ablation, cultural characteristic in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Valley, consumed more millets during childhood in the early period than those without dental ablation in the late period. Our study here provides novel insights into cultural dynamics and the interplay between rice and millets in rice-millet agricultural system during the Late Neolithic in Southwest China.","Animals and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and China and Crops, Agricultural and Diet and History, Ancient and *Millets and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and *Oryza and Swine",2021/10/26 06:00,10.1002/ajpa.24259 [doi],33638171,0400654,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),United States,© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,10.1002/ajpa.24259 [doi],"Chengdu Plain and human life history and millet-Rice agriculture and stable isotope (C, N) analysis and subsistence strategy",NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We sampled surface water and biota from 8 lakes in Quebec, Canada, spanning a range of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (2.9-8.4 mg/L); 4 lakes were inhabited by native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and the remaining lakes contained brook trout and a non-native fish, Allegheny pearl dace (Margariscus margarita). Periphyton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and fish were analyzed for: 1) stable carbon (δ(13) C) and nitrogen (δ(15) N) isotope ratios to delineate food webs, and 2) total Hg (THg) or MeHg. Compared with the brook trout from reference lakes, fish from invaded lakes had higher length-standardized THg concentrations as well as a narrower dietary range and elevated trophic level, inferred from unadjusted δ(13) C and δ(15) N values, respectively. The rate of Hg biomagnification was similar across invaded and reference lakes, implying little effect of the invasive fish on the trophic transfer of MeHg. Despite differences in food web structure due to pearl dace invasion, DOC was the strongest predictor of brook trout THg levels for all lakes, suggesting that underlying environmental factors exerted a stronger influence on brook trout THg concentrations than the presence of a non-native forage fish.

Here, we studied the use of basal resources and trophic levels of dominating soil meso- and macrofauna using stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in arable fallow systems 3 and 14-16 years after abandonment. Animals were sampled from the rhizosphere of three plant species of different functional groups: a legume (Medicaco sativa), a nonlegume herb (Taraxacum officinale), and a grass (Bromus sterilis). We found virtually no consistent effects of plant identity on stable isotope composition of soil animals and on thirteen isotopic metrics that reflect general food-web structure. However, in old fallows, the carbon isotope composition of some predatory macrofauna taxa had shifted closer to that of co-occurring plants, which was particularly evident for Lasius, an aphid-associated ant genus. Trophic levels and trophic-chain lengths in food webs were similar across plant species and fallow ages. Overall, the results suggest that variations in local plant diversity of grassland communities may little affect the basal resources and the trophic level of prey consumed by individual species of meso- and macrofauna belowground.

Log10THg increased significantly with δ(15)N and trophic position from invertebrates (0.01 ± 0.01 μg · g(-1) [113 ± 1 ng · g(-1)] dw in copepods) to Greenland Sharks (3.54 ± 1.02 μg · g(-1)). The slope of the log10THg vs. δ(15)N linear regression was higher for pelagic compared to benthic food web components (excluding Greenland Sharks, which could not be assigned to either food web), which resulted from THg concentrations being higher at the base of the benthic food web (i.e., in benthic than pelagic primary consumers). However, feeding habitat is unlikely to consistently influence shark THg exposure in Cumberland Sound because THg concentrations did not consistently differ between benthic and pelagic shark prey. Further, size, gender and feeding behavior (inferred from stable isotopes and fatty acids) were unable to significantly explain THg variability among individual Greenland Sharks. Possible reasons for this result include: 1) individual sharks feeding as generalists, 2) high overlap in THg among shark prey, and 3) differences in turnover time between ecological tracers and THg. This first assessment of Greenland Shark THg within an Arctic food web revealed high concentrations consistent with biomagnification, but low ability to explain intra-specific THg variability. Our findings of high THg levels and consumption of multiple prey types, however, suggest that Greenland Sharks acquire THg through a variety of trophic pathways and are a significant contributor to the total biotic THg pool in northern seas.","Animals and *Environmental Monitoring and Feeding Behavior/*drug effects and *Food Chain and Greenland and Mercury/*metabolism/toxicity and Sharks/*physiology and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*metabolism/toxicity",2015/06/06 06:00,S0048-9697(14)00158-2 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.01.128 [doi],24630590,0330500,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",Netherlands,Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Emergent aquatic insects are a particularly important prey source for riparian songbirds but may also move aquatic contaminants, such as mercury (Hg), to riparian food webs. While many studies focus on species that eat primarily emergent aquatic insects, we instead study riparian songbirds with flexible foraging strategies, exploiting both aquatic and terrestrial prey sources. The goal in this study is to trace reliance on aquatic prey sources and correlate it to Hg concentrations in common riparian arachnids (Families Tetragnathidae, Opiliones, and Salticidae) and songbirds (Common Yellowthroat Geothlypis trichas, Spotted Towhee Pipilo maculatus, Swainson's Thrush Catharus ustulatus, Song Sparrow Melospiza melodia, and Yellow Warbler Setophaga petechia). We used stable isotopes of δ(13)C and δ(15)N and Bayesian mixing models in MixSIAR to determine the reliance of riparian predators on aquatic prey sources. Using mixed effects models, we found that arachnid families varied in their reliance on aquatic prey sources. While songbird species varied in their reliance on aquatic prey sources, songbirds sampled earlier in the season consistently relied more on aquatic prey sources than those sampled later in the season. For both arachnids and songbirds, we found a positive correlation between the amount of the aquatic prey source in their diet and their Hg concentrations. While the seasonal pulse of aquatic prey to terrestrial ecosystems is an important source of nutrients to riparian species, our results show that aquatic prey sources are linked with higher Hg exposure. For songbirds, reliance on aquatic prey sources early in the breeding season (and subsequent higher Hg exposure) coincides with timing of egg laying and development, both of which may be impacted by Hg exposure.",NA,2021/06/19 06:01,ECE37549 [pii] and 10.1002/ece3.7549 [doi],34141271,101566408,NA,England,© 2021 The Authors.

Given that higher agricultural intensity can increase nutrient runoff and reduce the riparian zone and litter in-fall into streams, we predicted that generalist fish would derive less energy from the terrestrial pathway and become more omnivorous.

Total Hg and stable isotopes were measured in samples of particulate organic matter (POM), zooplankton, squid, myctophid fish, notothenioid fish and seabird tissues collected in two years (austral summers 2007/08 and 2016/17). Overall, there was extensive overlap in δ(13)C values across taxonomic groups suggesting similarities in habitats, with the exception of the seabirds, which showed some differences, possibly due to the type of tissue analysed (feathers instead of muscle). δ(15)N showed increasing enrichment across groups in the order POM to zooplankton to squid to myctophid fish to notothenioid fish to seabirds. There were significant differences in δ(1)(5)N and δ(1)(3)C values among species within taxonomic groups, reflecting inter-specific variation in diet. Hg concentrations increased with trophic level, with the lowest values in POM (0.0005 ± 0.0002 μg g(-1) dw) and highest values in seabirds (3.88 ± 2.41 μg g(-1) in chicks of brown skuas Stercorarius antarcticus). Hg concentrations tended to be lower in 2016/17 than in 2007/08 for mid-trophic level species (squid and fish), but the opposite was found for top predators (i.e. seabirds), which had higher levels in the 2016/17 samples. This may reflect an interannual shift in the Scotia Sea marine food web, caused by the reduced availability of a key prey species, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. In 2016/17, seabirds would have been forced to feed on higher trophic-level prey, such as myctophids, that have higher Hg burdens. These results suggest that changes in the food web are likely to affect the pathway of mercury to Southern Ocean top predators.","Animals and Antarctic Regions and Bioaccumulation and Environmental Monitoring and Food Chain and *Mercury/analysis and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Oceans and Seas and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2021/03/11 06:00,S0269-7491(21)00198-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2021.116620 [doi],33581632,8804476,"0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",England,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, a multi-proxy approach elucidates dietary responses of carnivorans to changing climates and megafaunal extinctions. Using sample sizes that are unavailable anywhere else in the world, including hundreds of carnivoran and herbivore specimens, we clarify the paleobiology of the extinct sabertooth cats and dire wolves-overturning the idea that they heavily competed for similar prey. Canids (especially the dire wolf) consumed prey from more open environments than felids, demonstrating minimal competition for prey throughout the latest Pleistocene and largely irrespective of changing climates, including just prior to their extinction. Coyotes experienced a dramatic shift in dietary behavior toward increased carcass utilization and the consumption of forest resources (prey and/or plant resources) after the terminal Pleistocene megafaunal extinction. Extant predators' ability to effectively hunt smaller prey and/or utilize carcasses may have been a key to their survival, especially after a significant reduction in megafaunal prey resources. Collectively, these data suggest that dietary niches of carnivorans are not always static and can instead be substantially affected by the removal of top predators and abundant prey resources.","Animals and *Biodiversity and California and *Climate Change and *Diet and Ecosystem and *Extinction, Biological and Felidae/*physiology and Fossils and Mammals and Wolves/*physiology",2020/07/21 06:00,S0960-9822(19)30786-9 [pii] and 10.1016/j.cub.2019.06.059 [doi],31386836,9107782,NA,England,Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated the behaviour of several pharmaceuticals in the rocky-bottom, macrobenthic food web in the coastal zone of Isfjorden (western Spitsbergen) using stable isotope analyses (SIA) coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Across 16 macroalgal and invertebrate species the highest average concentration was measured for ciprofloxacin (CIP) (on average 60.3 ng g(-1) dw) followed by paracetamol (PCT) (51.3 ng g(-1) dw) and nicotine (NIC) (37.8 ng g(-1) dw). The biomagnification potential was assessed for six target compounds of 13 analytes detected that were quantified with a frequency > 50 % in biological samples. The trophic magnification factor (TMF) ranged between 0.3 and 2.8, and was significant for NIC and CIP. TMF < 1.0 for NIC (0.3; confidence interval, CI 0.1-0.5) indicated that the compound does not accumulate with trophic position. The dilution of pharmaceutical residues in the food web may result from limited intake with dietary route, poor assimilation efficiency and high biotransformation rates in benthic invertebrates. TMF for CIP (2.8, CI 1.2-6.4) suggests trophic magnification, a phenomenon observed previously for several antibiotics in freshwater food webs. Trophic transfer therefore plays a role in controlling concentration of CIP in the Arctic benthic communities and should be considered in environmental risk assessment. Biomagnification potential of diclofenac (DIC; 0.9, CI 0.5-1.7), carbamazepine (CBZ; 0.4, CI 0.1-2.1), caffeine (CAF; 0.9, CI 0.5-1.9) and PCT (1.3, CI 0.7-2.7) was not evident due to large 95 % confidence of their TMFs.

Within the Lake Michigan food web, invasive dreissenid mussels have caused rapid changes to food web structure and potentially altered the channels through which consumers acquire energy. We used stable C and N isotopes to determine how Lake Michigan food web structure has changed in the past decade, coincident with the expansion of dreissenid mussels, decreased pelagic phytoplankton production, and increased nearshore benthic algal production. Fish and invertebrate samples collected from sites around Lake Michigan were analyzed to determine taxa-specific 13C:12C (delta13C) and 15N:14N (delta15N) ratios. Sampling took place during two distinct periods, 2002-2003 and 2010-2012, that spanned the period of dreissenid expansion, and included nearshore, pelagic and profundal fish and invertebrate taxa. The magnitude and direction of the delta13C shift indicated significantly greater reliance upon nearshore benthic energy sources among nearly all fish taxa as well as profundal invertebrates following dreissenid expansion. Although the mechanisms underlying this delta13C shift likely varied among species, possible causes include the transport of benthic algal production to offshore waters and increased feeding on nearshore prey items by pelagic and profundal species. delta15N shifts were more variable and of smaller magnitude across taxa, although declines in delta15N among some pelagic fishes suggest a shift to alternative prey resources. Lake Michigan fishes and invertebrates appear to have responded to dreissenid-induced changes in nutrient and energy pathways by switching from pelagic to alternative nearshore energy subsidies. Although large shifts in energy allocation (i.e., pelagic to nearshore benthic) resulting from invasive species appear to affect total production at upper trophic levels, changes in trophic structure and utilization of novel energy pathways may help to stabilize food webs following species invasions.",Animals and Anseriformes/physiology and Environmental Monitoring and Fishes/*physiology and *Food Chain and Invertebrates/*physiology and Lakes/*chemistry and Population and Time Factors,2014/07/25 06:00,10.1890/13-0329.1 [doi],25000756,0043541,NA,United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The present study explores the dietary changes at the Roman to post-Roman (Germanic) transition in the Northwest Iberian Peninsula, in order to improve our understanding of the changes that occurred at end of the Roman Empire in different regions across Europe and to also consider the influence of climate had on them. The carbon and nitrogen stable isotope investigation in bone collagen from A Lanzada, NW Spain (100-700 AD), which was an important commercial, coastal settlement has been presented. A human sample of 59 individuals, 6 of them subadults, is compared with 31 faunal specimens, which include a number of marine fish. Isotope data for the terrestrial fauna reveal the influence of the sea on the local isotope baseline. Analysis of the human samples indicates a mixed marine-terrestrial diet. A shift in mean human δ(13) C values from -16.7‰ to -14.3‰ provides clear evidence for a significant change in diet in the post-Roman period, probably through the intensification of both marine resources exploitation and C4 -plant consumption (presumably millet). A deterioration of paleoenvironmental conditions, together with a poor socioeconomic situation and the arrival of new people, the Sueves, who brought a new political and socioeconomic system have been discussed as the main causes for the dietary modification in post-Roman times.","Adolescent and Adult and Agriculture and Animals and Anthropology, Physical and Bone and Bones/chemistry and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Cattle and *Cultural Evolution and Diet/*history and Female and Goats and History, Ancient and History, Medieval and Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Roman World/*history and Sheep and Spain and Swine and Tooth/chemistry and Young Adult",2017/06/10 06:00,10.1002/ajpa.23016 [doi],27311883,0400654,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),United States,"© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/ajpa.23016 [doi],migration period and millet and paleodiet and saltmarsh influence and stable isotopes,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Empirical evidence suggests that size structure prevails in aquatic ecosystems, whereas in terrestrial food webs trophic position is largely independent of body size. Compartmentalization of energy channeling according to size classes of consumers was suggested as a mechanism that underpins functioning and stability of terrestrial food webs including those belowground, but their structure has not been empirically assessed across the whole size spectrum. Here we used stable isotope analysis and metabolic regressions to describe size structure and energy use in eight belowground communities with consumers spanning 12 orders of magnitude in living body mass, from protists to earthworms. We showed a negative correlation between trophic position and body mass in invertebrate communities and a remarkable nonlinearity in community metabolism and trophic positions across all size classes. Specifically, we found that the correlation between body mass and trophic level is positive in the small-sized (protists, nematodes, arthropods below 1 μg in body mass), neutral in the medium-sized (arthropods of 1 μg to 1 mg), and negative in the large-sized consumers (large arthropods, earthworms), suggesting that these groups form compartments with different trophic organization. Based on this pattern, we propose a concept of belowground food webs being composed of (1) size-structured micro-food web driving fast energy channeling and nutrient release, for example in microbial loop; (2) arthropod macro-food web with no clear correlation between body size and trophic level, hosting soil arthropod diversity and subsidizing aboveground predators; and (3) ""trophic whales,"" sequestering energy in their large bodies and restricting its propagation to higher trophic levels in belowground food webs. The three size compartments are based on a similar set of basal resources, but contribute to different ecosystem-level functions and respond differently to variations in climate, soil characteristics and land use. We suggest that the widely used vision of resource-based energy channeling in belowground food webs can be complemented with size-based energy channeling, where ecosystem multifunctionality, biodiversity, and stability are supported by a balance across individual size compartments.",Animals and Biodiversity and Ecosystem and *Food Chain and *Nematoda and Soil,2021/09/07 06:00,10.1002/ecy.3421 [doi],34086977,0043541,0 (Soil),United States,© 2021 The Authors.

They have caused significant changes in the many freshwater systems they have invaded by increasing water clarity, reducing primary productivity, and altering zooplankton and benthic invertebrate assemblages. What is less clear is how their ecosystem engineering effects manifest up the food web to impact higher trophic levels, including fish. Here, we use a biological tracer (stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen) to analyze long-term and broad-scale trends in the resource use of benthivorous lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) in the Laurentian Great Lakes, where dreissenid mussels have become established in each lake except Lake Superior. We measured stable isotope ratios from archived material (fish scale samples) collected over several decades by multiple agencies and from 14 locations around the Great Lakes. In the majority of locations, the δ(13) C of lake whitefish increased following the establishment of dreissenid mussels. Trends in δ(15) N were less clear, but significant breakpoints in the time series occurred within 5 yr of dreissenid establishment in several locations, followed by declines in δ(15) N. In contrast, isotopic signatures in Lake Superior locations did not show these trends. Our results provide evidence that lake whitefish shifted toward greater reliance on nearshore benthic production, supporting the theory that fundamental energy pathways are changed when dreissenid mussels become established. Importantly, these effects were noted across multiple, large, and complex ecosystems spanning a broad geographic area.

While many sharks are opportunistic predators, some exhibit prey selectivity, putting them at higher risk compared to species with greater trophic plasticity. In the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), Clupeids and Sciaenids comprise 69% of blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) diets, which is consequential considering potential responses of these prey groups to disturbance and over harvesting. We assessed if blacktips exhibit selectivity for Clupeids and Sciaenids in the western GOM based on stomach contents from sharks in coastal Texas. Clupeids comprised <2% of diets, while striped mullet (Mugil cephalus) and red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) comprised >70% of identifiable prey. Ontogenetic shifts from smaller (Clupeids, small Sciaenids) to larger, higher trophic level (Ariidae, Elasmobranchii) prey fits our understanding of foraging among coastal sharks, and suggests our regional understanding of blacktip trophic ecology may be limited by the sizes of sampled sharks. Observed increases in blacktip densities coupled with declines in prey (Mugilids, Sciaenids) is concerning if blacktips have limited diet plasticity.

Decisions to combat eutrophication in the North Sea were made in the 1980s. Despite significant improvements during recent decades, high nitrogen loads and resulting eutrophication problems remain. In this study, long-term changes in nitrogen inputs to the Elbe Estuary (Germany) were characterized based on nitrogen data provided by the Elbe River Basin Community from 1985 to 2019. Additionally, surface water samples were taken at the weir separating the river from the estuary from 2011 to 2021 to characterize dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations and nitrate stable isotope composition. The findings suggest a close coupling of river discharge with the riverine nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen loads decreased disproportionately with decreasing discharge. This decrease is due to intensified nitrogen retention in the Elbe catchment, which can double nitrogen retention compared to average discharge conditions. Phytoplankton growth was enhanced by long residence times and high light availability at low water levels. This suggests that the recent decreases in nitrogen loads in the Elbe River were not only a result of management measures in the catchment but were also amplified by a recent long-lasting drought in the catchment.

However, published results are contrasting. We performed a metanalysis integrating all available studies that evaluated TL shifts in fishes between trawled and untrawled environments and conducted a local study comparing several features of the trophic ecology in two species of fishes. According to the metanalysis, TL does not change significantly with trawling. In contrast, the local study showed higher TLs and broader isotopic niches in the trawled environment. Diet reconstruction indicated a potential consumption of hake, the main discard component, at the trawled environment. All the studies used in the metanalysis were conducted in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the local study represents the first data available from the Southern Hemisphere.

Traditionally, delta13C vs. delta15N bi-plots have been used to describe food web structure for a single time period or ecosystem. Comparisons of food webs across time and space are increasing, but development of statistical approaches for testing hypotheses regarding food web change has lagged behind. Here we present statistical methodologies for quantitatively comparing stable isotope food web data. We demonstrate the utility of circular statistics and hypothesis tests for quantifying directional food web differences using two case studies: an arthropod salt marsh community across a habitat gradient and a freshwater fish community from Lake Tahoe, USA, over a 120-year time period. We calculated magnitude and mean angle of change (theta) for each species in food web space using mean delta13C and delta15N of each species as the x, y coordinates. In the coastal salt marsh, arthropod consumers exhibited a significant shift toward dependence on Spartina, progressing from a habitat invaded by Phragmites to a restored Spartina habitat. In Lake Tahoe, we found that all species from the freshwater fish community shifted in the same direction in food web space toward more pelagic-based production with the introduction of nonnative Mysis relicta and onset of cultural eutrophication. Using circular statistics to quantitatively analyze stable isotope food web data, we were able to gain significant insight into patterns and changes in food web structure that were not evident from qualitative comparisons. As more ecologists incorporate a food web perspective into ecosystem analysis, these statistical tools can provide a basis for quantifying directional food web differences from standard isotope data.",Animals and Arthropods/*growth & development and Carbon Isotopes and Ecology/*methods and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring/methods and Fishes/*growth & development and *Food Chain and Fresh Water and Isotopes/*analysis and Nitrogen Isotopes and Seawater,2008/01/23 09:00,10.1890/07-0121.1 [doi],18051648,0043541,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the environmental factors that regulate contaminant body burdens in nearshore terrestrial consumers remain largely unexplored. We investigated the relative influences of riparian landscape composition (i.e., land use and nearshore vegetation structure) and contaminant flux via the emergent aquatic insect subsidy on selenium (Se) and mercury (Hg) body burdens of riparian ants (Formica subsericea) and spiders of the family Tetragnathidae along 11 river reaches spanning an urban-rural land-use gradient in Ohio, USA. Model-selection results indicated that fine-scale land cover (e.g., riparian zone width, shrub cover) in the riparian zone was positively associated with reach-wide body burdens of Se and Hg in both riparian F. subsericea and tetragnathid spiders (i.e., total magnitude of Hg and Se concentrations in ant and spider populations, respectively, for each reach). River distance downstream of Columbus, Ohio - where study reaches were impounded and flow through a large urban center - was also implicated as an important factor. Although stable-isotope analysis suggested that emergent aquatic insects were likely vectors of Se and Hg to tetragnathid spiders (but not to F. subsericea), emergent insect contaminant flux did not emerge as a significant predictor for either reach-wide body burdens of spider Hg or Se.

Adding organic residues to agricultural systems may therefore enhance pest control. We investigated whether resource addition (maize mulch) strengthens aboveground trophic cascades in winter wheat fields. Evaluating the flux of the maize-borne carbon into the food web after 9 months via stable isotope analysis allowed differentiating between prey in predator diets originating from the above- and belowground subsystems. Furthermore, we recorded aphid populations in predator-reduced and control plots of no-mulch and mulch addition treatments. All analyzed soil dwelling species incorporated maize-borne carbon. In contrast, only 2 out of 13 aboveground predator species incorporated maize carbon, suggesting that these 2 predators forage on prey from the above- and belowground systems. Supporting this conclusion, densities of these two predator species were increased in the mulch addition fields. Nitrogen isotope signatures suggested that these generalist predators in part fed on Collembola thereby benefiting indirectly from detrital resources. Increased density of these two predator species was associated by increased aphid control but the identity of predators responsible for aphid control varied in space. One of the three wheat fields studied even lacked aphid control despite of mulch-mediated increased density of generalist predators. The results suggest that detrital subsidies quickly enter belowground food webs but only a few aboveground predator species include prey out of the decomposer system into their diet. Variation in the identity of predator species benefiting from detrital resources between sites suggest that, depending on locality, different predator species are subsidised by prey out of the decomposer system and that these predators contribute to aphid control. Therefore, by engineering the decomposer subsystem via detrital subsidies, biological control by generalist predators may be strengthened.","Agriculture/methods and Animals and *Aphids and Carbon Radioisotopes/analysis and *Food Chain and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and *Pest Control, Biological and *Soil/analysis and Triticum/parasitology and Zea mays",2010/10/19 06:00,1604 [pii] and 10.1007/s00442-010-1604-6 [doi],20349249,0150372,0 (Carbon Radioisotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Soil),Germany,NA,10.1007/s00442-010-1604-6 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC2903711,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However their effects on biogeochemical cycles have rarely been quantified. We estimated bird numbers, diet (from stable isotope analysis), food supply, and the food consumption on rice fields by overwintering waterbirds in one of the most important areas for rice production in southwestern Europe and a key area for various migrating and resident waterbird species. Herein, we modelled the nutrient (N and P) recycling in rice fields, and their transport to reservoirs. The energy consumption by waterbirds (96,605±18,311 individuals) on rice fields during winter averaged at 89.9±39.0 kJ·m(-2), with its majority (89.9%) belonging to foraging on rice seeds. Thus, the birds removed about 26% of rice seeds leftover after harvest (estimated in 932.5±504.7 seeds·m(-2) in early winter) wherein common cranes and dabbling ducks (four species) were the most important consumers. Waterbirds foraging and roosting in the rice fields recycled more than 24.1 (1.0 kg·ha(-1)) of N and an additional 5.0 tons (0.2 kg·ha(-1)) of P in the Extremadura's rice fields during winter. Additionally, we estimated that 2.3 tons of N and 550 kg of P were removed from rice fields and transported to reservoirs. The seasonal foraging of wildlife should result in a direct benefit for rice farmers by improving nutrient recycling through defecation by waterbirds with respect to artificial fertilisation. Additionally, rice fields located in the cranes' core wintering areas can provide sufficient food supply to induce habitat shift from their traditional wintering habitat in 'dehesas' to rice fields, which causes indirect socioeconomic benefit through reduced acorn consumption by cranes. Our modelling approach may thus be especially helpful for management decisions regarding rice agroecosystems in areas which are also important for the conservation of migratory waterbirds.",Agriculture and Animals and *Biodiversity and Birds/*physiology and Conservation of Natural Resources/*methods and *Ecological and Environmental Phenomena and *Ecosystem and Oryza and Wetlands,2015/08/13 06:00,S0048-9697(14)01770-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.12.068 [doi],25553543,0330500,NA,Netherlands,Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Results showed the anthropogenic impacts on benthic and pelagic organic matter as well as macrobenthos, depending on the spatial and temporal scales. Macrobenthic trophic structure was affected by mariculture and nuclear power plants in the dry season (winter), and the allochthonous sources i.e. industrial and urban sewage in flood season (summer). Microphytobenthos dominated the sediment organic matter pool and macrobenthic diet, while the trophic importance of mangrove leaf litter for intertidal macrobenthic communities was low. However, mangroves showed their indirect effects on the variations in macrobenthic trophic function across tidal levels. The isotopic ratios of benthic food sources and common taxa varied significantly among the tidal levels of the mangrove-lined ecosystem. In addition, pooling the macrobenthic taxa based on their feeding guild and also biomass confirmed the causes and effects for variations in organic matter composition and flow indicated by representative species in the study area.

We investigated how Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) modify their late winter diets in response to long-term trends and interannual variation in forage availability and accessibility. By reconstructing their diets and foraging niches over a 17-year period (1995-2012) using serum δ(13) C and δ(15) N values, we found strong support for a temporal increase in the proportions of graminoids in the diets with a concurrent decline in the contributions of mosses. This dietary shift corresponds with graminoid abundance increases in the region and was associated with increases in population density, warmer summer temperatures and more frequent rain-on-snow (ROS) in winter. In addition, the variance in isotopic niche positions, breadths, and overlaps also supported a temporal shift in the foraging niche and a dietary response to extreme ROS events. Our long-term study highlights the mechanisms by which winter and summer climate changes cascade through vegetation shifts and herbivore population dynamics to alter the foraging niche of Svalbard reindeer.

It has recently been augmented by compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids (CSIA-AA), an innovation that can provide greater precision when analyzing trophic level and food web connectivity. The utility of SIA rests on confidence in its constituent parameters such as the trophic enrichment factor (TEF). There is increasing emphasis on the need to experimentally derive species and tissue specific TEFs for studies utilizing SIA. Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, is a species with high potential for study using SIA due to the difficulty in observing its ecology during its marine phase and the significance of the conservation consequences of recent population declines. METHODS: Bulk and amino acid-specific TEFs were determined for juvenile and adult Chinook salmon fed specific diets. Three controlled feeding studies were performed: adult salmon were fed a biofeed, juvenile salmon were fed a biofeed, and juvenile salmon were fed krill. Bulk and compound-specific stable isotope data were collected from diet samples and from salmon muscle tissue after a minimum of 8 weeks of controlled feeding. Bulk isotope signatures were measured using EA-IRMS and CSIA-AA signatures using GC/C-IRMS, allowing the TEFs to be calculated. RESULTS: The bulk isotope TEFs were higher than those predicted for similar marine organisms and averaged 3.5‰ for ∆(15) N and 1.3‰ for ∆(13) C. The TEFs derived for nitrogen isotopes of amino acids were in line with expectations for this approach: the mean value for ∆(15) N(Glu)  - ∆(15) N(Phe) was 7.06‰ and, using a multi-AA approach, the value for ∆(15) N(Trophic)  - ∆(15) N(Source) was 6.67‰. For carbon isotopes of amino acids, the derived TEFs of Iso, Leu and Phe were near 0‰, as was that of Met, supporting their use of as source amino acids in future CSIA studies.

However, the impact of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on composition and transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) during long-distance transport and seasonal cycle is not fully understood. By using a combination of elemental, isotopic and optical techniques, as well as Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), we investigated DOM abundance and composition along the whole mainstream at highly spatial resolution in the dry and early wet seasons. Our findings showed that the concentration and flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Yangtze River was much lower compared with other worldwide larger rivers. The distribution of δ(13)C(DOC) and higher abundance of humic-like fluorescent component and highly unsaturated and phenolics (HUPs) compound reflected a prominent contribution of allochthonous DOM. Further optical and molecular analysis revealed humic-like fluorescent components were coupled with CHO molecules and HUPs compound with higher aromatic, unsaturated, molecular weight and stable characteristics between upstream and midstream reaches. With increasing agricultural and urban land downstream, there were more heteroatomic formulae and labile aliphatic and protein-like compounds which were derived from human activities and in situ primary production. Meanwhile, DOM gradually accumulates with slow water flow and additional autochthonous organics. Weaker solar radiation and water dilution during the dry/cold season favours highly aromatic, unsaturated and oxygenated DOM compositions. Conversely, higher discharge during the wet/warm season diluted the terrestrial DOM, but warm temperatures could promote phytoplankton growth that releases labile aliphatic and protein-like DOM. Besides, chemical sulfurization, hydrogenation and oxygenation were found during molecular cycling processes. Our research emphasizes the active response of riverine DOM to natural and anthropogenic controls, and provides a valuable preliminary background to better understand the biogeochemical cycling of DOM in a larger river.",Humans and *Dissolved Organic Matter and *Ecosystem and Agriculture and Humic Substances/analysis and Rivers/chemistry,2023/03/16 06:00,S0043-1354(23)00247-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.watres.2023.119812 [doi],36881953,0105072,0 (Dissolved Organic Matter) and 0 (Humic Substances),England,Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) exhibited significant ontogenetic shifts in diet and Hg, although such patterns were not evident for other species. Food web structure, as indicated by stable isotope values (δ(15)N, δ(13)C) was not static. Log-transformed Hg data were strongly and consistently correlated with δ(15)N values for the whole food web in each of the three seasons (slopes, 0.17-0.24) and across the entire year (slope, 0.2). While significantly different between seasons, the regression slope values are still consistent with published global Hg biomagnification rates.

Omnivores are able to adjust their diet flexibly according to environmental conditions, such that their impacts on food webs and communities, and the macronutrients constraining their population, can be plastic. In particular, omnivore diets are known to be influenced by prey availability, which exhibits high spatial and temporal variation. To examine the plasticity of diet and macronutrient limitation in omnivores, we compared trophic positions, macronutrient preferences and food exploitation rates of omnivorous ants in invertebrate-rich (secondary forests) and invertebrate-poor (Lophostemon confertus plantations) habitats. We hypothesized that omnivorous ants would have lower trophic positions, enhanced protein limitation and reduced food exploitation rates in L. confertus plantations relative to secondary forests. We performed cafeteria experiments to examine changes in macronutrient limitation and food exploitation rates. We also sampled ants and conducted stable isotope analyses to investigate dietary shifts between these habitats. We found that conspecific ants were less carnivorous and had higher preferences for protein-rich food in L. confertus plantations compared to secondary forests. However, ant assemblages did not exhibit increased preferences for protein-rich food in L. confertus plantations. At the species-level, food exploitation rates varied idiosyncratically between habitats. At the assemblage-level, food exploitation rates were reduced in L. confertus plantations. Our results reveal that plantation establishments alter the diet and foraging behaviour of omnivorous ants. Such changes suggest that omnivorous ants in plantations will have reduced top-down impacts on prey communities but also see an increased importance of protein as a bottom-up force in constraining omnivore population sizes.",Animals and *Ants and Ecosystem and Food Chain and Forests and Invertebrates,2021/03/20 06:00,10.1111/1365-2656.13249 [doi],32379899,0376574,NA,England,© 2020 British Ecological Society.,10.1111/1365-2656.13249 [doi],ants and ecosystem functions and food exploitation and macronutrient limitation and omnivores and plantations and trophic interactions and tropical forests,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,Dryad/10.5061/dryad.wstqjq2hk,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The ability of organisms to supplement primary nutritional modes along continua of autotrophy and heterotrophy fosters trophic flexibility that can sustain metabolic demands under variable or stressful conditions. Symbiotic, reef-building corals are among the most broadly distributed and ecologically important mixotrophs, yet we lack a basic understanding of how they modify their use of autotrophy and heterotrophy across gradients of food availability. Here, we evaluate how one coral species, Pocillopora meandrina, supplements autotrophic nutrition through heterotrophy within an archipelago and test whether this pattern holds across species globally. Using stable isotope analysis (δ(13)C) and satellite-derived estimates of nearshore primary production (chlorophyll-a, as a proxy for food availability), we show that P. meandrina incorporates a greater proportion of carbon via heterotrophy when more food is available across five central Pacific islands. We then show that this pattern is consistent globally using data from 15 coral species across 16 locations spanning the Caribbean Sea and the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Globally, surface chlorophyll-a explains 77% of the variation in coral heterotrophic nutrition, 86% for one genus across 10 islands, and 94% when controlling for coral taxonomy within archipelagos. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that satellite-derived estimates of nearshore primary production provide a globally relevant proxy for resource availability that can explain variation in coral trophic ecology. Thus, our model provides a pivotal step toward resolving the biophysical couplings between mixotrophic organisms and spatial patterns of resource availability in the coastal oceans.",Animals and Anthozoa/*metabolism and Autotrophic Processes and Carbon/*metabolism and *Coral Reefs and *Ecosystem and Oceans and Seas and *Symbiosis,2019/10/28 06:00,S0960-9822(18)31141-2 [pii] and 10.1016/j.cub.2018.08.057 [doi],30344114,9107782,7440-44-0 (Carbon),England,Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that B. chinensis has expanded dietary breadth without shifting trophic position in its introduced range.

Both termite and B. chinensis abundance were higher in the introduced range than in native range.

Stable isotope analysis was used to investigate the contribution of organic sources originated from the Po River Delta, one of the widest deltaic wetlands in the northern Mediterranean Sea, to the diet of the nearby coastal macrobenthic consumers, and their influence on invertebrates' trophic structure and biomass. Following intense river flood events, macrofauna samples were collected in the prodelta area at increasing distance from the main river distributary mouth. Potential primary resources were collected within the delta and the prodelta areas. A terrestrial signal in the primary consumers' diet was evident as a shift in their δ(13)C, being this more (13)C depleted near the main river distributary. The Bayesian mixing models indicated an important contribution of deltaic sources, in particular C4-grass detritus (25-57%), to primary consumers' diet, confirming a strong energetic link between delta and prodelta areas. Overall, most of the consumers' biomass were concentrated at sites close to the main distributary mouth, mainly as suspension and surface deposit feeders. A simplification of the macrobenthic community structure, accompanied by narrower transfer pathways was also evident at sites more distant from the main river distributary, in relation to changes in the quality of resources. Our data, although limited to winter season, suggest that during periods of low in situ productivity but high river flow energy, invertebrates are able to efficiently exploit terrigenous food sources, restraining the detrimental effect of increased turbidity and sedimentation.

In the present study, an ecosystem-scale model has been applied to determine how selenium in a seagrass food web is processed from sediments and water through diet to predators, using stable isotopes (δ(13) C and δ(15) N) to establish the trophic position of organisms. Trophic position, habitat, and feeding zone were examined as possible factors influencing selenium bioaccumulation. Selenium concentrations ranged from 0.2 μg/g dry weight in macroalgae species to 12.9 μg/g in the carnivorous fish Gerres subfasciatus. A mean magnification factor of 1.39 per trophic level showed that selenium is biomagnifying in the seagrass food web. Habitat and feeding zone influenced selenium concentrations in invertebrates, whereas feeding zone was the only significant factor influencing selenium concentrations in fish. The sediment-water partitioning coefficient (Kd ) of 4180 showed that partitioning of selenium entering the lake to particulate organic material (POM) is occurring, and consequently availability to food webs from POM is high. Trophic transfer factors (invertebrate = 1.9; fish = 1.2) were similar to those reported for other water bodies, showing that input source is not the main determinant of the magnitude of selenium bioaccumulation in a food web, but rather the initial partitioning of selenium into bioavailable POM.

The total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations did not exceed the threshold limits and performed as: fish > crustaceans > mollusks. The trophic level values (TLs) were less than 3 in all the groups, indicating simple structure of food chain. With the increasing δ(15)N value, THg and MeHg were significantly biomagnified in the mollusks and fish but not in the crustaceans. In addition, the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of MeHg were higher than inorganic mercury (IHg) in the aquatic food chain. Target hazard quotient (THQ) and provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) indicated that Hg exposure via consumption of seafood from the Jiaozhou Bay did not pose significant health risks for general population. Consuming fish will face the higher health risk than crustaceans and mollusks, especially in urban regions. Moreover, the risk of MeHg caused by intaking seafood deserved more attention. Trophic transfer function (TTF) explicated the transfer of Hg in the ecosystem and higher trophic transfer efficiency of MeHg than IHg. TTF interpreted the terrestrial input of Hg should be controlled to ensure the safety of consuming seafood from the Jiaozhou Bay.","Animals and Aquatic Organisms and Dietary Exposure and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and Fishes and Food Chain and Humans and *Mercury/analysis and *Methylmercury Compounds and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2021/07/22 06:00,S0045-6535(21)01307-2 [pii] and 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.130836 [doi],33991905,0320657,"0 (Methylmercury Compounds) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",England,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we contributed to the understanding of the biological impacts of land use on streams, investigating how landscape effects vary with spatial scales (local vs. regional). We adopted a food web approach integrating both biological structure and functioning, to focus on the overall effect of land use on stream biocœnosis. We selected 17 sites of a small tributary of the Seine River (France) for their contrasted land use, and conducted a natural experiment by sampling three organic matter sources, three macroinvertebrate taxa, and most of the fish community. Using stable isotope analysis, we calculated three food web metrics evaluating two major dimensions of the trophic diversity displayed by the fish community: (i) the diversity of exploited resources and (ii) the trophic level richness. The idea was to examine whether (1) land-use effects varied according to spatial scales, (2) land use affected food webs through an effect on community structure and (3) land use affected food webs through an effect on available resources. Beside an increase in trophic diversity from upstream to downstream, our empirical data showed that food webs were influenced by land use in the riparian corridors (local scale). The effect was complex, and depended on site's position along the upstream-downstream gradient. By contrast, land use in the catchment (regional scale) did not influence stream biocœnosis. At the local scale, community structure was weakly influenced by land use, and thus played a minor role in explaining food web modifications. Our results suggested that the amount of available resources at the base of the food web was partly responsible for food web modifications. In addition, changes in biological functioning (i.e. feeding interactions) can also explain another part of the land-use effect. These results highlight the role played by the riparian corridors as a buffer zone, and advocate that riparian corridor should be at the centre of water management attention.",Agriculture and Animals and Biodiversity and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Ecosystem and *Fishes and *Food Chain and France and *Invertebrates and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Rivers and Urbanization,2019/01/08 06:00,10.1007/s11356-017-8771-5 [pii] and 10.1007/s11356-017-8771-5 [doi],28337627,9441769,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),Germany,NA,10.1007/s11356-017-8771-5 [doi],Biological functioning and Fish community and Food webs and Land use and Stable isotopes and Stream ecology and Trophic diversity and Urbanisation,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Epub 2018 and Aug 20.,167,1096-8644 (Electronic) and 0002-9483 (Linking) and 2,257-271,"OBJECTIVES: The Early Neolithic involved an important social and economic shift that can be tested not only with the material culture, but also through biomolecular approaches. The Iberian Peninsula presents few Early Neolithic sites where fauna and humans can be analyzed together from an isotopic perspective. Here we present an isotopic study on the site of Cueva de Chaves as an example for understanding the dietary and economical changes that took place during Early Neolithic in Iberia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Here we apply carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis to bone collagen from 4 humans and 64 faunal samples from 14 different species. The large dataset belongs to the same unique chrono-cultural context secured by 20 radiocarbon dates. Three direct new radiocarbon dates were carried out on the human remains analyzed. RESULTS: Faunal isotope values show no significant differences between wild and domestic herbivores, although the latter have more homogeneous values. Domestic pigs, potentially considered omnivorous, also show signatures of a herbivore diet. Human isotopic results show a diet mainly based on terrestrial C(3) resources and possibly high meat consumption. The only individual found buried with a special funerary treatment presents a slightly different protein intake, when taking into account the long contemporaneous baseline analyzed. DISCUSSION: Similar values between wild and domestic species could be the result of common feeding resources and/or grazing on the same parts of the landscape. The herbivore diet seen amongst domestic pigs rules out feeding on household leftovers. High meat consumption by humans would support the hypothesis of the existence of a specialized animal husbandry management community in which agriculture was not intensively developed. Our results suggest that the development of agricultural practices and animal husbandry were not necessarily associated together in the early stages of the Western Mediterranean Neolithic.","Animal Husbandry/*history and Animals and Anthropology, Physical and Bone and Bones/*chemistry and Carbon Isotopes/*analysis and Carnivory and Collagen/*chemistry and Diet/*history and Dogs/physiology and Herbivory and History, Ancient and Humans and Nitrogen Isotopes/*analysis and Spain and Swine/physiology",2019/10/11 06:00,10.1002/ajpa.23622 [doi],30129180,0400654,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 9007-34-5 (Collagen),United States,"© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/ajpa.23622 [doi],animal management and carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes and cardial and domestication and funerary practices and radiocarbon dating,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,"Fundación Ibercaja-CAI (2016)/International and Research Stay Scholarship/International and Gobierno de Aragón and the Fondo Social Europeo/International and BOA20150701025/Predoctoral Scholarship/International and HAR2014-59042-P/Transiciones Climáticas y Adaptaciones Sociales en la Prehistoria and de la Cuenca del Ebro/International and PPVE research group (H-07: Primeros Pobladores del Valle del Ebro)/International and BBVA Foundation/International and I Ayudas a Investigadores, Innovadores y Creadores Culturales/International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For example, DNA barcoding, or the identification of prey with taxon-specific DNA sequences, allows researchers to classify digested prey tissues to the species-level, while stable isotope analysis paired with Bayesian mixing models can quantify dietary contributions by comparing a consumer's isotopic values to those derived from their prey. However, DNA-based methods are currently only able to classify, but not quantify, the taxa present in a diet sample, while stable isotope analysis can only quantify dietary taxa that are identified a priori as prey isotopic values are a result of life history traits, not phylogenetic relatedness. Recently, researchers have begun to couple these techniques in dietary studies to capitalize on the reciprocal benefits and drawbacks offered by each approach, with some even integrating DNA-based results directly into Bayesian mixing models as informative priors. As the informative priors used in these models must represent known dietary compositions (e.g., percentages of prey biomasses), researchers have scaled the DNA-based frequency of occurrence of major prey groups so that their normalized frequency of occurrence sums to 100%. Unfortunately, such an approach is problematic as priors stemming from binomial, DNA-based data do not truly reflect quantitative information about the consumer's diet and may skew the posterior distribution of prey quantities as a result. Therefore, we present a novel approach to incorporate DNA-based dietary information into Bayesian stable isotope mixing models that preserves the binomial nature of DNA-based results. This approach uses community-wide frequency of occurrence or logistic regression-based estimates of prey occurrence to dictate the probability that each prey group is included in each mixing model iteration, and, in turn, the probability that each iteration's results are included in the posterior distribution of prey composition possibilities.

Such aquaculture releases organic wastes, especially feed waste (i.e. food pellets made in part from terrestrial feed ingredients). Terrestrial compounds from feed wastes were used to trace their consumption by the two decapods in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Both species were collected in farms and reference sites and their fatty acid profiles evaluated. Individuals in close proximity to salmon farms were found to consume waste feed (high proportions of 18:1n-9 and 18:2n-6 and low proportions of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3). This consumption is associated with a reduction in diet diversity and a trend of increased lipid content in rock crab, suggesting that this species is more receptive to the waste feed than the American lobster, which did not show evidence of diet diversity loss and of increased lipid content. Fatty acid profiles from rock crab ovaries were also affected by the diet shift toward waste feed (low proportion of long-chain essential fatty acids), suggesting a potential influence on crab reproductive success. However, this remains to be assessed. Resulting effects of diet shifts on the ecosystem (e.g. reduction in the consumption of primary consumers and change of fatty acids transferred to predatory fish or gulls through decapods) should be evaluated to assess the spatial and temporal scales of the salmon aquaculture footprint. If the assessment reveals a strong footprint, measures to reduce wastes could be considered (e.g. pellets with greater buoyancy or with different recipe).",Animal Feed and Animals and Aquaculture and Canada and *Decapoda and Ecosystem and *Salmon,2020/03/25 06:00,S0048-9697(19)34855-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134863 [doi],32000329,0330500,NA,Netherlands,Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The dry biomass of eggs is estimated to be 5 x 10(3) kg, yet only 25% of this organic matter will return to the ocean in the form of hatchlings. Such amounts of organic matter are supposed to drive the functioning of the beach ecosystem. Previous studies have shown that egg predators and detritivorous organisms dominate the trophic relationships and the dynamics of the system. The role of a terrestrial insect Scapteriscus didactylus (Latreille), which damages up to 40% of the eggs of the marine turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), was unexpected. However it was impossible from direct observations to prove that the mole cricket consumed a significant amount of these eggs. Therefore, the precise place of the mole cricket in the nitrogen and carbon cycles of the beach ecosystem could not be determined. In order to answer this question, we looked for a marine signature of carbon and nitrogen source metabolized by the mole cricket. RESULTS: This study estimated the individual variability of delta13C and delta15N in the cuticle of Scapteriscus didactylus. The isotopic signature was compared between individuals collected at two sites: a village where mole crickets fed on human food scraps and the nearby Awala-Yalimapo beach, where food availability depends seasonally on the nesting sea turtles. The mole crickets collected near the habitations garbage showed no significant variations in the stable isotopic signature, within-and between age groups. On the contrary, isotopic values shifted from a signature of a terrestrial herbivorous diet in the mole crickets during early developmental stages, to isotopic values in adults in accordance with the exploitation of marine animal resources. CONCLUSION: The heterogeneity of individual signatures during the year is due to a selective exploitation of the food sources, differing in space and time. Some individuals, from the beach sample consumed a sufficient quantity of turtle eggs to induce the increase of isotopic enrichment observed in the cuticle. Scapteriscus didactylus is an opportunist feeder and plays a role in the turn over of the beach organic matter.",Animals and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and *Diet and Ecology and *Food Chain and French Guiana and Gryllidae/*chemistry/*growth & development and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Ovum and Reproduction and Seasons and Turtles,2006/08/25 09:00,1472-6785-6-6 [pii] and 10.1186/1472-6785-6-6 [doi],16681850,101088674,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),England,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC1533807,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although this is expected to modify the structure of food webs, we have a relatively poor understanding of the potential consequences of such alteration. Here, we take advantage of a collection of ancient consumer tissues, using stable isotope analysis and SIBER to assess changes in the structure of coastal marine food webs in the South-western Atlantic through the second half of the Holocene as a result of the sequential exploitation of marine resources by hunter-gatherers, western sealers and modern fishermen. Samples were collected from shell middens and museums. Shells of both modern and archaeological intertidal herbivorous molluscs were used to reconstruct changes in the stable isotopic baseline, while modern and archaeological bones of the South American sea lion Otaria flavescens, South American fur seal Arctocephalus australis and Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus were used to analyse changes in the structure of the community of top predators. We found that ancient food webs were shorter, more redundant and more overlapping than current ones, both in northern-central Patagonia and southern Patagonia. These surprising results may be best explained by the huge impact of western sealing on pinnipeds during the fur trade period, rather than the impact of fishing on fish populations. As a consequence, the populations of pinnipeds at the end of the sealing period were likely well below the ecosystem's carrying capacity, which resulted in a release of intraspecific competition and a shift towards larger and higher trophic level prey.

The importance of these flatfish as a human dietary resource indicates they are potential sources of mercury (Hg) to fish-consuming citizens. In this study, summer flounder (SF) and winter flounder (WF) were collected from the Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island, USA) and were measured for total Hg burden in whole-body or dorsal muscle tissue. Interspecies differences in Hg contamination were analyzed relative to flounder body size, age, and Hg content of preferred prey. Stable isotope signatures were also used to elucidate the effect of trophic processes on Hg accumulation in the estuarine food web. The mean Hg content of SF exceeded concentrations measured in WF across multiple life-history stages (0.039-0.100 and 0.016-0.029 mg Hg/kg wet weight for SF and WF, respectively), and observed values for both species were lower than the US Environmental Protection Agency regulatory threshold of 0.3 mg Hg/kg wet weight. Total Hg concentrations were also positively correlated with flounder age and length, verifying that both flatfish bioaccumulate Hg. SF accumulate Hg at an accelerated rate, however, owing to this species consuming Hg-enriched prey (teleosts, squid, and macrocrustaceans; mean Hg content = 0.023 mg Hg/kg wet weight), whereas WF feed on prey with low Hg levels (amphipods and polychaetes; mean Hg content = 0.013 mg Hg/kg wet weight). The positive correlation observed between mean biota Hg content and stable nitrogen (delta(15)N) isotope signatures further indicates that Hg is trophically transferred through the food web, and higher trophic level organisms (i.e., enriched delta(15)N) have increased Hg concentrations. Therefore, results from this study suggest that dietary preference and trophic structure are the main factors affecting Hg bioaccumulation in the estuary.

The study was carried out in a Brazilian basin highly impacted by anthropogenic activities, especially discharge of domestic and industrial sewage from a region with more than five million human inhabitants. To evaluate the trophic ecology of both native and exotic species it was analysed carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) stable isotopes of fish tissue, food resources and, sewage. Moreover, stable isotopes analyses were coupled with gut contents of the two species to provide additional information about fish diet. Exotic guppy abundance was high in the most polluted site, where P. reticulata assimilated carbon directly from sewage. The native species was absent in the most polluted site, but presented wider niches than the exotic species in almost all other sites. Gut content analyses indicated high consumption of aquatic insects by both species. However, while the native species consumed a diverse suite of insect taxa, the exotic species consumed mainly Chironomidae larvae. We conclude that aquatic pollution promotes diet shifts in both native and exotic species, with both species changing their trophic niches in a similar way according to the level of degradation of the environment. The ability to directly assimilate sewage, together with its capacity to survive in environments with poor water quality and its reproductive strategy, may favour the establishment of exotic guppies in strongly polluted sites.",Animals and Aquatic Organisms/physiology and Brazil and *Environmental Monitoring and Fishes/*physiology and *Food Chain and Water Pollution/*statistics & numerical data,2019/08/17 06:00,S0048-9697(19)32110-2 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.092 [doi],31128341,0330500,NA,Netherlands,Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although δ(13)C of both sources and consumers varied little between sampling sites and dates, δ(15)N spatial variability was higher and clearly reflected the organic enrichment in the second inlet as well as the uptake of anthropogenically derived material by benthic consumers. On the other hand, within the first inlet, the isotopic composition of consumers did not change in response to chemical contamination. However, the impact of polluted sediments near the Navy Arsenal in the first inlet was detectable at the level of the macrobenthic trophic structure, showing high dominance of motile, upper level consumers capable to face transient conditions and the reduction of the more resident deposit feeders.

Land-use such as forestry activities in the Canadian Boreal region have increased in the last decades, raising concerns about their potential impact on aquatic ecosystems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of forest harvesting on trophic structure in eastern Canadian Boreal Shield lakes. We measured carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes values for aquatic primary producers, terrestrial detritus, benthic macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) over a three-year period in eight eastern Boreal Shield lakes. Four lakes were studied before, one and two years after forest harvesting (perturbed lakes) and compared with four undisturbed reference lakes (unperturbed lakes) sampled at the same time. Stable isotope mixing models showed leaf-litter to be the main food source for benthic primary consumers in both perturbed and unperturbed lakes, suggesting no logging impact on allochthonous subsidies to the littoral food web. Brook trout derived their food mainly from benthic predatory macroinvertebrates in unperturbed lakes. However, in perturbed lakes one year after harvesting, zooplankton appeared to be the main contributor to brook trout diet. This change in brook trout diet was mitigated two years after harvesting. Size-related diet shift were also observed for brook trout, indicating a diet shift related to size. Our study suggests that carbon from terrestrial habitat may be a significant contribution to the food web of oligotrophic Canadian Boreal Shield lakes. Forest harvesting did not have an impact on the diet of benthic primary consumers. On the other hand, brook trout diet composition was affected by logging with greater zooplankton contribution in perturbed lakes, possibly induced by darker-colored environment in these lakes one year after logging.",Animals and Canada and Carbon Isotopes and Diet and *Ecosystem and Food Chain and *Forests and *Lakes and Nitrogen Isotopes and Trout/*growth & development and Zooplankton/*growth & development,2015/08/01 06:00,PONE-D-13-42036 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0096143 [doi],24763366,101285081,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0096143 [doi] and e96143,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC3999157,Competing Interests: The authors wish to state that Dr. Philippe Archambault is a and member of the PLOS ONE Editorial Board.

Knowledge of plant water uptake pattern is indispensable for understanding soil-plant interactions and species coexistence. The 'Grain for Green' project that started in 1999 in the Loess Plateau of China has led to large scale vegetation change. However, little is known about the water uptake patterns of the main plant species that inhabit in this region. In this study, the seasonal variations in water uptake patterns of three representative plant species, Stipa bungeana, Artemisia gmelinii and Vitex negundo, that are widely distributed in the semi-arid area of the Loess Plateau, were identified by using dual stable isotopes of δ(2)H and δ(18)O in plant and soil water coupled with a Bayesian mixing model MixSIAR. The soil water at the 0-120cm depth contributed 79.54±6.05% and 79.94±8.81% of the total water uptake of S. bungeana and A. gmelinii, respectively, in the growing season. The 0-40cm soil contributed the most water in July (74.20±15.20%), and the largest proportion of water (33.10±15.20%) was derived from 120-300cm soils in August for A. gmelinii. However, V. negundo obtained water predominantly from surface soil horizons (0-40cm) and then switched to deep soil layers (120-300cm) as the season progressed. This suggested that V. negundo has a greater degree of ecological plasticity as it could explore water sources from deeper soils as the water stress increased. This capacity can mainly be attributed to its functionally dimorphic root system. V. negundo may have a competitive advantage when encountering short-term drought. The ecological plasticity of plant water use needs to be considered in plant species selection and ecological management and restoration of the arid and semi-arid ecosystems in the Loess Plateau.",Artemisia/*physiology and Bayes Theorem and China and Ecosystem and Isotopes/analysis and Poaceae/*physiology and *Seasons and Soil and Vitex/*physiology and Water/*metabolism,2018/08/14 06:00,S0048-9697(17)31836-3 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.07.133 [doi],28734247,0330500,0 (Isotopes) and 0 (Soil) and 059QF0KO0R (Water),Netherlands,Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We used stable C and N isotope ratios to elucidate trophic relationships between C. pengoi, zooplankton (microzooplankton, 90-200 microm, mostly copepod nauplii and rotifers; mesozooplankton, >200 microm, mostly copepods), and zooplanktivorous fish (herring, size range 5-15 cm and sprat, 9-11 cm) in a coastal area of the northern Baltic Sea. The isotope ratios in C. pengoi and fish were much higher than those of zooplankton, showing general trends of enrichment with trophic level. Young-of-the-year (YOY) herring had a significantly higher (15)N/(14)N ratio than C. pengoi, suggesting of a trophic linkage between the two species. To evaluate the possible relative importance of different food sources for C. pengoi and YOY herring, two-source isotope-mixing models for N were used, with micro- and mesozooplankton as prey for C. pengoi and mesozooplankton and C. pengoi as prey for YOY herring. These models indicate that mesozooplankton was the major food source of both species. However, microzooplankton may be important prey for young stages of C. pengoi. Comparative analyses of the herring trophic position before and after the invasion by C. pengoi showed a trophic level shift from 2.6 to 3.4, indicating substantial alterations in the food web structure. Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence, showing that C. pengoi can modify food webs and trophic interactions in invaded ecosystems.","Animals and Carbon Isotopes and Cladocera/*physiology and Fishes/metabolism/physiology and *Food Chain and *Models, Biological and Nitrogen Isotopes and North Sea and Predatory Behavior/*physiology and Zooplankton/metabolism/physiology",2005/06/10 09:00,10.1007/s00442-004-1791-0 [doi],15688211,0150372,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),Germany,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, some of them are subjected to mercury (Hg) contamination, resulting in the ban of human consumption of piscivorous fish. Moreover, beyond predatory fish, little information exist regarding Hg levels in other species of these ecosystems. In this context, we used a food web analytical approach to investigate Hg bioaccumulation and biomagnification in relation to the trophic structure of these four lakes. More specifically, various organisms (macrophytes, epiphyton, invertebrates and fish) were collected at the four lakes and analysed for carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes as well as for total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg). A spatial variability of bioaccumulation in organisms was observed, particularly in carnivorous fish, with higher Hg levels being found in the two more northern lakes (median±SE: 3491 ± 474 and 1113 ± 209 ng THg.g(-1) dw in lakes HC and L, respectively) than in the southern pair (600 ± 117 and 911 ± 117 ng THg.g(-1) dw in lakes CS and PB, respectively). Methylmercury biomagnification was observed through the food webs of all four lakes, with different trophic magnification slopes (HC = 0.16; L = 0.33; CS = 0.27; PB = 0.27), even though the length of the food chains was similar between the lakes. Our results suggest that rather than the food web structure, anthropogenic inputs (sulfate in northern lakes and phosphorus inputs in southern ones) may have a strong impact, more or less directly, on Hg methylation in freshwater environments, and lead to concentrations exceeding environmental recommendations despite low Hg backgrounds in sediment and water.","Animals and Bioaccumulation and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and Fishes and Food Chain and France and Humans and Lakes and *Mercury/analysis and *Methylmercury Compounds and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2021/01/22 06:00,S0045-6535(20)33088-5 [pii] and 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128890 [doi],33248739,0320657,"0 (Methylmercury Compounds) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",England,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Determining how species respond to forest fragmentation is essential for management efforts. We use stable isotope biogeochemistry to investigate how disturbance affects resource partitioning between two genera of cheirogaleid lemurs (Cheirogaleus and Microcebus) from three humid forest sites: continuous and fragmented forest at Tsinjoarivo, and selectively logged forest at Ranomafana. We test three hypotheses: (H1) cheirogaleids are unaffected by forest fragmentation, (H2) species respond individually to disturbance and may exploit novel resources in fragmented habitat, and (H3) species alter their behavior to rely on the same key resource in disturbed forest. We find significant isotopic differences among species and localities. Carbon data suggest that Microcebus feed lower in the canopy than Cheirogaleus at all three localities and that sympatric Cheirogaleus crossleyi and C. sibreei feed at different canopy heights in the fragmented forest. Microcbus have higher nitrogen isotope values than Cheirogaleus at all localities, indicating more faunivory. After accounting for baseline isotope values in plants, our results provide the most support for H3. We find similar isotopic variations among localities for both genera. Small differences in carbon among localities may reflect shifts in diet or habitat use. Elevated nitrogen values for cheirogaleid lemurs in fragments may reflect increased arthropod consumption or nutritional stress. These results suggest that cheirogaleids are affected by forest disturbance in Eastern Madagascar and stress the importance of accounting for baseline isotopic differences in plants in any work comparing localities.",Animals and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and *Diet and *Ecosystem and *Isotope Labeling and Lemur/metabolism/*physiology and Madagascar and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Plants/metabolism and *Trees,2014/03/01 06:00,10.1007/s00114-013-1094-6 [doi],24036664,0400767,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),Germany,NA,10.1007/s00114-013-1094-6 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this complex context, a proper description of the origin and potential sources of pollution is necessary to address management and mitigation actions aimed at preserving the quality of the water resource and the integrity of the ecosystems. Here, we aimed at detecting sources of both nitrogen inputs, by N stable isotope analysis of macroalgae, and metals in macroalgae and sediments in two highly anthropized coastal stretches at the Iranian side of the Caspian Sea. Sampling was done near the mouth of rivers and canals draining agricultural and urbanized areas. In the westernmost waters, facing a port city, low macroalgal δ(15)N signatures indicated industrial fertilizers as the principal source of pollution. By contrast, in the central coastal waters, facing touristic areas, the high macroalgal δ(15)N indicated N inputs from wastewaters. Here the lowest dissolved oxygen concentrations in waters were associated with excess dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Metal concentrations varied largely in the study areas and were lower in macroalgae than in sediments. Localized peaks of Pb and Zn in sediments were observed in the central coastal sites as probable byproducts of mining activity transported downstream. By contrast, Cr and Ni concentrations were high in all sampling sites, thus potentially representing hazardous elements for marine biota. Overall, macroalgal δ(15)N coupled with metal analysis in macroalgae and sediments was useful for identifying the main sources of pollution in these highly anthropized coastal areas. This double approach in comprehensive monitoring programs could thus effectively inform stakeholders on major environmental threats, allowing targeted management measures.","Caspian Sea and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and Geologic Sediments and Iran and *Metals, Heavy/analysis and Nitrogen and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2021/02/20 06:00,10.1007/s11356-020-11243-8 [pii] and 11243 [pii] and 10.1007/s11356-020-11243-8 [doi],33156502,9441769,"0 (Metals, Heavy) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and N762921K75 (Nitrogen)",Germany,NA,10.1007/s11356-020-11243-8 [doi],Bioassessment and Coastal waters and Macroalgae and Metals and Nitrogen stable isotopes and Sediment,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,Progetti di Ateneo 2016/Sapienza Università di Roma/ and 2015/AZ1.01/Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide/ and 2016_00291/Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide/,PMC7884576,The authors declare that they have no competing interests.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, theory on the trophic impacts of invasive fauna on native competitors is ambiguous, as while increased interspecific competition can result in the species having constricted and diverged trophic niches, the species might instead increase their niche sizes, especially in omnivorous species. The competitive interactions between an omnivorous invasive fish, common carp Cyprinus carpio, and a tropically analogous native and threatened fish, crucian carp Carassius carassius, were tested using comparative functional responses (CFRs). A natural pond experiment then presented the species in allopatry and sympatry, determining the changes in their trophic (isotopic) niche sizes and positions over 4 years. These predictive approaches were complemented by assessing their trophic relationships in wild populations. Comparative functional responses revealed that compared to crucian carp, carp had a significantly higher maximum consumption rate. Coupled with a previous cohabitation growth study, these results predicted that competition between the species is asymmetric, with carp the superior competitor. The pond experiment used stable isotope metrics to quantify shifts in the trophic (isotopic) niche sizes of the fishes. In allopatry, the isotopic niches of the two species were similar sized and diverged. Conversely, in sympatry, carp isotopic niches were always considerably larger than those of crucian carp and were strongly partitioned. Sympatric crucian carp had larger isotopic niches than allopatric conspecifics, a likely response to asymmetric competition from carp. However, carp isotopic niches were also larger in sympatry than allopatry. In the wild populations, the carp isotopic niches were always larger than crucian carp niches, and were highly divergent. The superior competitive abilities of carp predicted in aquaria experiments were considered to be a process involved in sympatric crucian carp having larger isotopic niches than in allopatry. However, as sympatric carp also had larger niches than in allopatry, this suggests other ecological processes were also likely to be involved, such as those relating to fish prey resources.

In the Florida Everglades, seasonal reductions in freshwater flow and precipitation lead to annual migrations of aquatic taxa from marsh habitats to deep-water refugia in estuaries. The timing and intensity of freshwater reductions, however, will be modified by ongoing ecosystem restoration and predicted climate change. Understanding the importance of seasonally pulsed resources to predators is critical to predicting the impacts of management and climate change on their populations. As with many large predators, however, it is difficult to determine to what extent predators like bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) in the coastal Everglades make use of prey pulses currently. We used passive acoustic telemetry to determine whether shark movements responded to the pulse of marsh prey. To investigate the possibility that sharks fed on marsh prey, we modelled the predicted dynamics of stable isotope values in bull shark blood and plasma under different assumptions of temporal variability in shark diets and physiological dynamics of tissue turnover and isotopic discrimination. Bull sharks increased their use of upstream channels during the late dry season, and although our previous work shows long-term specialization in the diets of sharks, stable isotope values suggested that some individuals adjusted their diets to take advantage of prey entering the system from the marsh, and as such this may be an important resource for the nursery. Restoration efforts are predicted to increase hydroperiods and marsh water levels, likely shifting the timing, duration and intensity of prey pulses, which could have negative consequences for the bull shark population and/or induce shifts in behaviour.

Little is known about the biomagnification of PBDEs in the Lake Michigan food web. Plankton, Diporeia, lake whitefish, lake trout, and Chinook salmon were collected from Lake Michigan in 2006 between April and August. Fish liver and muscle and whole invertebrates were analyzed for six PBDEs (BDE-47, 99, 100, 153, 154, and 209). Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) were also quantified in order to establish the trophic structure of the food web. Geometric means of Sigma PBDE concentrations in fish ranged from 0.562 to 1.61 microg/g-lipid. BDE-209 concentrations ranged from 0.184 to 1.23 microg/g-lipid in all three fish species. Sigma BDE-47, 99, and 209 comprised 80-94% of Sigma PBDE molar concentration. Within each fish species, there were no significant differences in PBDE concentrations between liver and muscle. The highest concentration of BDE-209 (144 microg/g-lipid) was detected in Diporeia. Based on analysis of delta(15)N and PBDE concentrations, BDE-47 and 100 were found to biomagnify, whereas BDE-209 did not. A significant negative correlation between BDE-209 and trophic level was found in this food web. Biomagnification factors were also calculated and again BDE-47 and 100 biomagnified between food web members whereas BDE-209 did not. Diporeia could be one of the main dietary sources of BDE-209 for fish in Lake Michigan; BDE-47 and 100 biomagnified within this food chain; the concentration of BDE-209 decreased at higher trophic levels, suggesting partial uptake and/or biotransformation of BDE-209 in the Lake Michigan food web.","Amphipoda/*metabolism and Animals and Biodiversity and Biotransformation and Body Burden and Body Weight and Carbon Isotopes/metabolism and Environmental Monitoring and Fishes/growth & development/*metabolism and Flame Retardants/*metabolism and *Food Chain and Fresh Water/chemistry and Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers/*metabolism and Liver/metabolism and Michigan and Muscles/metabolism and Nitrogen Isotopes/metabolism and Plankton/*metabolism and Tissue Distribution and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*metabolism",2010/06/11 06:00,10.1007/s10646-009-0431-1 [doi],19882349,9885956,"0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Flame Retardants) and 0 (Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",United States,NA,10.1007/s10646-009-0431-1 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Dietary contributions of basal resources to consumers and food web metrics including trophic length, diversity, and redundancy were used to quantify changes in stream food webs in response to anthropogenic disturbance. Dietary analysis showed that allochthonous resources contributed more than autochthonous resources to macroinvertebrate primary consumers regardless of the disturbance intensity in the adjacent land areas. Anthropogenic activities increased the δ(15)N values in epilithic algae and isotopic variation in basal resources and fish but reduced the trophic length and redundancy (i.e., fewer species or taxon at each trophic level) in food webs.

Coupling multiple stable isotopes such as (13)C with (15)N, (18)O or (2)H has the potential to reveal even more information about complex stoichiometric relationships during biogeochemical transformations. Isotope labeled plant material has been used in various studies of litter decomposition and soil organic matter formation(1-4). From these and other studies, however, it has become apparent that structural components of plant material behave differently than metabolic components (i.e. leachable low molecular weight compounds) in terms of microbial utilization and long-term carbon storage(5-7). The ability to study structural and metabolic components separately provides a powerful new tool for advancing the forefront of ecosystem biogeochemical studies. Here we describe a method for producing (13)C and (15)N labeled plant material that is either uniformly labeled throughout the plant or differentially labeled in structural and metabolic plant components. Here, we present the construction and operation of a continuous (13)C and (15)N labeling chamber that can be modified to meet various research needs. Uniformly labeled plant material is produced by continuous labeling from seedling to harvest, while differential labeling is achieved by removing the growing plants from the chamber weeks prior to harvest. Representative results from growing Andropogon gerardii Kaw demonstrate the system's ability to efficiently label plant material at the targeted levels. Through this method we have produced plant material with a 4.4 atom%(13)C and 6.7 atom%(15)N uniform plant label, or material that is differentially labeled by up to 1.29 atom%(13)C and 0.56 atom%(15)N in its metabolic and structural components (hot water extractable and hot water residual components, respectively). Challenges lie in maintaining proper temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, and light levels in an airtight (13)C-CO2 atmosphere for successful plant production.

However, previous studies regarding plant water uptake were primarily conducted in wet areas under seasonal drought conditions, with a limited understanding of the proportion and drivers of plant water uptake under humid conditions. Actually, climate change and variations in global precipitation patterns could simultaneously trigger seasonal drought and flooding. Therefore, it is critical to explore patterns and mechanisms for plant water uptake under humid conditions in wet regions. Here, we employed dual stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen coupled with a Bayesian mixing model (MixSIAR) to explore the water uptake patterns of Populus deltoides in two types of riparian forests (pure vs. mixed stand of P. deltoides), under different magnitudes of rainfall (7.9, 15.4 and 34.1 mm), in the Middle-Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River in China. We further used both partial correlation and variation partitioning analyses to determine the relative importance of soil variables and plant properties affecting the proportion of P. deltoides water uptake from different soil layers. Our results revealed that compared to pure stands, P. deltoides in mixed stands had a lower water uptake proportion from deep soil layers (60-80, 80-100 cm) and had higher water uptake from shallow soil layers (0-20, 20-40 cm) under 15.4 mm and 34.1 mm rainfall events. Our results also revealed that plant properties such as leaf biomass, fine root biomass, and diameter at breast height were the primary factors influencing water uptake by P. deltoides. This suggests that P. deltoides in mixed stands could increase the proportion of water uptake from shallow soil layers through altering plant attributes. These findings indicate that mixed stands could restrain frequent extreme rainfall events and subsequent flooding, suggesting more resilience towards future climatic variability.",Bayes Theorem and China and Forests and *Populus and Soil and Water,2020/03/31 06:00,S0048-9697(19)35951-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135956 [doi],31846884,0330500,0 (Soil) and 059QF0KO0R (Water),Netherlands,Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Adults with chicks are thought to gradually switch feeding sites from freshwater wetlands to coastal mudflats as the chicks' osmoregulatory system develops. We investigated age-dependent shifts in the diet of Black-faced Spoonbill chicks at four breeding colonies with varying freshwater habitat availability by examining stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N) between the tip (grown at the age of 10 days) and middle (grown at the age of 22 days) portions of their primary feathers. The δ13C value of the middle portions was significantly higher than that of the tips, which suggested that the ratio of marine resources increased with the growth and development of chicks. A Bayesian isotope mixing model revealed that the diet proportion of marine prey in the early-chick rearing season was slightly higher than in the late-chick rearing season at three colonies in inshore areas, although this proportion was approximately 60% even in the early chick-rearing period. In contrast, isotopic values and reconstructed diet composition suggested that chicks in an offshore colony with limited freshwater wetlands relied more heavily on freshwater diets for both chick-rearing periods (>80%). Our results suggest that the shifts in feeding sites seen in previous studies might be related to the age-dependent dietary shift of chicks, highlighting the importance of freshwater wetlands for spoonbills on offshore islands without an inflow of freshwater in nearby intertidal mudflats.

This report addresses the fundamental concepts underlying the use of the SI ratio. The unique characteristics of the SI ratio make it an interdisciplinary parameter that acts as a chemical fingerprint of biogenic substances and provides a key to the world of isotopomers. Variations in SI ratios of biogenic substances depend on the isotopic compositions of reactants, the pathways and kinetic modes of reaction dynamics, and the physicochemical conditions. In fact, every biogenic material has its own isotopic composition, its ""dynamic SI fingerprint"", which is governed by its function and position in the material flow. For example, the relative SI ratio in biota is determined by dietary lifestyle, e.g., the modes of drinking, eating, and excreting, and appears highly regular due to the physicochemical differences of isotopomers. Our primary goal here is to elucidate the general principals of isotope partitioning in major biophilic elements in molecules, biogenic materials, and ecosystems (Wada, E. et al., 1995). To this end, the nitrogen and carbon SI distribution ratios (delta(15)N and delta(13)C, respectively) are used to examine materials cycling, food web structures, and their variability in various kinds of watershed-including aquatic ecosystems to elucidate an ""isotopically ordered world"".",Animals and Carbon Dioxide/analysis and Carbon Isotopes and Chemical Fractionation and *Ecosystem and Fishes and Food Chain and Fresh Water/chemistry and Geologic Sediments/chemistry and Humans and Nitrogen Isotopes and Russia and Sewage/chemistry and Water/*chemistry,2009/06/25 09:00,JST.JSTAGE/pjab/85.98 [pii] and pjab-85-98 [pii] and 10.2183/pjab.85.98 [doi],19282646,9318162,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Sewage) and 059QF0KO0R (Water) and 142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide),Japan,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC3524304,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Understanding their impacts on organisms that use this zone, such as juvenile flatfish, is critical. By combining stable isotope data, digestive tract contents and community analyses of flatfish and their potential prey (benthic macroinvertebrates) from two North-East Atlantic sandy beaches (one impacted by blooms and one not), we detected similar and species-specific trophic changes among three co-occurring species (sand sole, plaice and turbot). Across flatfish species, juveniles displayed more opportunistic foraging behavior at the impacted site. Differently, plaice and sand sole relied more on the additional basal resource (Ulva spp.) than turbot. Finally, sand sole and turbot presented a stronger diet shift at the impacted site than plaice. We hypothesize that the species-specific response to the blooms are mostly driven by how the flatfish detect their prey (using visual and/or chemical cues) and when they forage (diurnal or nocturnal foraging).","Animals and Behavior, Animal and Diet and *Ecosystem and *Eutrophication and Nutritional Status and Sand and *Ulva",2020/06/25 06:00,S0141-1136(19)30385-X [pii] and 10.1016/j.marenvres.2019.104843 [doi],32056701,9882895,0 (Sand),England,Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We quantified the ecological impact of riverine organic matter subsidies to glacier-marine habitats by developing a multi-trophic level Bayesian three-isotope mixing model. We utilized large gradients in stable (δ(13) C, δ(15) N, δ(2) H) and radiogenic (Δ(14) C) isotopes that trace riverine and marine organic matter sources as they are passed from lower to higher trophic levels in glacial-marine habitats. We also compared isotope ratios between glacial-marine and more oceanic habitats. Based on isotopic measurements of potential baseline sources, ambient water and tissues of marine consumers, estimates of the riverine organic matter source contribution to upper trophic-level species including fish and seabirds ranged from 12% to 44%. Variability in resource use among similar taxa corresponded to variation in species distribution and life histories. For example, riverine organic matter assimilation by the glacier-nesting seabirds Kittlitz's murrelet (Brachyramphus brevirostris) was greater than that of the forest-nesting marbled murrelet (B. marmoratus). The particulate and dissolved organic carbon in glacial runoff and near surface coastal waters was aged (12100-1500 years BP (14) C-age) but dissolved inorganic carbon and biota in coastal waters were young (530 years BP (14) C-age to modern). Thus terrestrial-derived subsidies in marine food webs were primarily composed of young organic matter sources released from glacier ecosystems and their surrounding watersheds. Stable isotope compositions also revealed a divergence in food web structure between glacial-marine and oceanic sites.

Interactions occurring among these invaders have important implications for ecosystem structure and functioning, yet they are poorly understood. Here we apply newly developed metrics derived from stable isotope data to provide quantitative measures of trophic diversity within populations or species. We then use these to test the hypothesis that sympatric invaders belonging to the same functional feeding group occupy a smaller isotopic niche than their allopatric counterparts. Two introduced, globally important, benthic omnivores, Louisiana swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and carp (Cyprinus carpio), are sympatric in Lake Naivasha, Kenya. We applied our metrics to an 8-year data set encompassing the establishment of carp in the lake. We found a strong asymmetric interaction between the two invasive populations, as indicated by inverse correlations between carp abundance and measures of crayfish trophic diversity. Lack of isotopic niche overlap between carp and crayfish in the majority of years indicated a predominantly indirect interaction. We suggest that carp-induced habitat alteration reduced the diversity of crayfish prey, resulting in a reduction in the dietary niche of crayfish. Stable isotopes provide an integrated signal of diet over space and time, offering an appropriate scale for the study of population niches, but few isotope studies have retained the often insightful information revealed by variability among individuals in isotope values. Our population metrics incorporate such variation, are robust to the vagaries of sample size and are a useful additional tool to reveal subtle dietary interactions among species. Although we have demonstrated their applicability specifically using a detailed temporal dataset of species invasion in a lake, they have a wide array of potential ecological applications.","Animals and Astacoidea/*physiology and Carbon Isotopes and Carps/*physiology and Confidence Intervals and Ecology/*methods and *Food Chain and Humans and *Introduced Species and Isotope Labeling/*methods and Metric System and Models, Biological and Nitrogen Isotopes and Population Dynamics and Time Factors and Water",2012/06/30 06:00,PONE-D-11-22497 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0031757 [doi],22363724,101285081,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 059QF0KO0R (Water),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0031757 [doi] and e31757,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC3283663,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although the surge in genome sequences has enabled insights into the genetic and metabolic properties of uncultured microorganisms, their physiology and ecological roles cannot be determined without direct probing of their activities in natural habitats. Here we employed an experimental framework coupling genome reconstruction and activity assays to characterize the largely uncultured microorganisms responsible for aerobic biodegradation of biphenyl as a proxy for a large class of environmental pollutants, polychlorinated biphenyls. We used (13)C-labeled biphenyl in contaminated soils and traced the flow of pollutant-derived carbon into active cells using single-cell analyses and protein-stable isotope probing. The detection of (13)C-enriched proteins linked biphenyl biodegradation to the uncultured Alphaproteobacteria clade UBA11222, which we found to host a distinctive biphenyl dioxygenase gene widely retrieved from contaminated environments. The same approach indicated the capacity of Azoarcus species to oxidize biphenyl and suggested similar metabolic abilities for species of Rugosibacter. Biphenyl oxidation would thus represent formerly unrecognized ecological functions of both genera. The quantitative role of these microorganisms in pollutant degradation was resolved using single-cell-based uptake measurements. Our strategy advances our understanding of microbially mediated biodegradation processes and has general application potential for elucidating the ecological roles of uncultured microorganisms in their natural habitats.","Biodegradation, Environmental and Biphenyl Compounds and Isotopes and Single-Cell Analysis and *Soil and Soil Microbiology and *Soil Pollutants",2021/12/15 06:00,10.1038/s41396-021-01022-9 [pii] and 1022 [pii] and 10.1038/s41396-021-01022-9 [doi],34117322,101301086,0 (Biphenyl Compounds) and 0 (Isotopes) and 0 (Soil) and 0 (Soil Pollutants) and 2L9GJK6MGN (diphenyl),England,© 2021.

We find unintended and lagged consequences of transitioning from a lake to a river, even temporarily, that resulted in trophic shifts away from piscivory and towards feeding at lower trophic levels for two common piscivorous fishes in reservoirs. Using natural abundances of nitrogen stable isotopes, we observed lower trophic level of feeding for invasive Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) and native Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during the summers following reservoir refilling than in nearby reference reservoirs that were not temporarily drained during fall. Declines in trophic levels of aquatic top predators have been rarely documented outside of controlled laboratory conditions. While useful for assisting outmigration of juvenile salmonids, the temporary draining of a reservoir to riverbed can also result in novel shifts in foodweb dynamics including reduced piscivory.

Feammox was detected in all collected soils with direct N(2) production as the dominant Feammox pathway. It was estimated that approximately 6.91% of the applied nitrogen fertilizers were lost through Feammox in the paddy soils. RNA-SIP results showed that the composition of enriched active microbial communities were dependent on soil properties, especially the soil pH and grain size. Geobacter were enriched in most soils across various properties. The abundance of enriched GOUTA19 were significantly higher in soils with low pH than those in soils with medium pH and high pH, and the relative abundance of active Nitrososphaeraceae and Pseudomonas only increased in soils with medium and high pH during 4-day of incubation.

Biospeciemens collected in the summer of 2014 were compared with those in the spring of 2015, aiming to analyze the seasonal variation in the trophic structure of food web. Six quantitative community indices were calculated based on the isotope values of the organisms in Haizhou Bay. The results showed that the δ(13)C values of consumers ranged from -18.9‰ to -17.1‰, and the δ(13)C values of three potential food sources ranged from -18.1‰ to -23.4‰ in the spring of 2015. The calculation results of IsoSource model further demonstrated that the phytoplankton was the most important carbon source for consumers (80.8%), followed by sediment organic matter (10.8%) and particulate organic matter (8.4%). There was a significant difference in the δ(13)C values between the biospecimens in the summer of 2014 and those in the spring of 2015, while no significant difference was observed in δ(15)N values. Trophic structure of community-wide differed remarkably in different seasons indicated by the six quantitative community indices. The δ(13)C range, total area, mean nearest neighbor distance and standard deviation of nearest neighbor distance of the community were much higher in 2014 than those in 2015, but the δ(15)N range and mean distance to centroid showed no significant change.

The river continuum concept (RCC) and the riverine productivity model (RPM) predict a shift of energy supplying aquatic food webs along rivers: from terrestrial inputs in low-order streams to autochthonous production in mid-sized rivers. In Afromontane-savanna landscapes, the shifting numbers of large mammalian wildlife present a physical continuum whose ecological implications for rivers is not clearly understood. Here, we studied the influence of replacing large wildlife (mainly hippos) with livestock on the fractional contribution of C3 vegetation, C4 grasses and periphyton on macroinvertebrates in the Mara River, which is an African montane-savanna river known to receive large subsidy fluxes of terrestrial organic matter and nutrients mediated by large mammalian herbivores (LMH), both wildlife and livestock, in its middle and lower reaches. Using stable carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotopes, we identified spatial patterns in the fractional contribution of allochthonous organic matter from C3 and C4 plants (woody vegetation and grasses, respectively) and autochthonous energy from periphyton for macroinvertebrates at various sites of the Mara River and its tributaries. Potential energy sources and invertebrates were sampled at 80 sites spanning stream orders 1 to 7, various catchment land uses (forest, agriculture and grasslands) and different loading rates of organic matter and nutrients by LMH (livestock and wildlife, i.e., hippopotamus). The fractional contribution of different sources of energy for macroinvertebrates along the river did not follow predictions of the RCC and RPM. First, the fractional contribution of C3 and C4 carbon was not related to river order or location along the fluvial continuum but to the loading of organic matter (dung) by both wildlife and livestock. Notably, C4 carbon was important for macroinvertebrates even in large river sections inhabited by hippos. Second, even in small 1st -3rd order forested streams, periphyton was a major source of energy for macroinvertebrates, and this was fostered by livestock inputs fuelling aquatic primary production throughout the river network. Importantly, our results show that replacing wildlife (hippos) with livestock shifts river systems towards greater reliance on autochthonous sources of energy through an algae-grazer pathway as opposed to reliance on allochthonous inputs of C4 carbon through a detrital pathway.","Animals and Animals, Wild/metabolism and Carbon/metabolism and *Carcinoma, Renal Cell and Ecosystem and Female and Food Chain and Herbivory and Humans and *Kidney Neoplasms and Livestock and Male and Mammals/metabolism and Plants/metabolism",2022/05/17 06:00,S0048-9697(22)01545-5 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154452 [doi],35278569,0330500,7440-44-0 (Carbon),Netherlands,Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Here we use carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) stable isotope analysis of muscle from individuals collected in 2017-2018 (n = 383) to quantify diet composition and characterize movement patterns. We found a relatively small degree of variation in δ(13)C (range: -18.9 to -16.5‰) in comparison to δ(15)N values (6.7-14.7‰). At higher latitudes in the southern area (30-34°S), individuals had higher mean (±SD) δ(15)N values (12.2 ± 1.3‰) in comparison to those collected in the northern area (9.7 ± 1.5‰) between 20-26°S. At the northern area, isotope mixing models with informative priors showed that lanternfish (median: 50%) and krill (31%) were the primary foods. In the southern area, lanternfish (53%), krill (23%) and small pelagic fish (23%) were the primary food sources. Spatial shifts in diet composition were related to warming events that likely resulted in low abundance of sardines in the northern area. The latitudinal pattern in skipjack and krill δ(15)N values mirrored that of regional zooplankton isoscapes, suggesting residency at the timescale of isotopic turnover for muscle (~2-4 months), and that geographical variation in the baseline isotopic composition can be exploited to characterize seasonal movements of skipjack and other top marine consumers in this region.",Animals and Atlantic Ocean and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Ecology and Fisheries and *Isotopes and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and *Tuna,2021/03/17 06:00,S0141-1136(20)31013-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.marenvres.2020.105246 [doi],33535137,9882895,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),England,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

As parasites are integral parts of food webs, analysis of the trophic interactions between parasites and hosts was assessed through comparison of stable isotope ratios of carbon ((13)C/(12)C) and nitrogen ((15)N/(14)N). Largemouth yellowfish (Labeobarbus kimberleyensis) infected with the Asian tapeworm (Schyzocotyle acheilognathi) were collected from the Vaal Dam. Signatures of δ(13)C and δ(15)N were assessed in host muscle and liver tissue, and cestodes using an elemental analyser coupled with an isotope ratio-mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS). Hosts were enriched by 4.1‰ in the heavy nitrogen isotope with respect to the S. acheilognathi and therefore occupy a higher trophic position than the parasite. Comparison of δ(13)C indicates that dietary sources of carbon in cestodes are derived from the host liver. Comparison of stable isotope signatures between Paradiplozoon ichthyoxanthon (another common parasite of the Largemouth yellowfish in the Vaal River) and S. acheilognathi showed that the monogenean was enriched by 5.3‰ in (15)N which accounts for a difference of almost two trophic positions. Isotope differences in the host-parasite system considered indicate that differences can be related to the mode of nutrient acquisition employed by host and parasites. Cestodes, being depleted in both (13)C and (15)N relative to the host and monogenean (P. ichthyoxanthon), indicate that S. acheilognathi assimilates nutrients derived from the host metabolism which are released from the liver.",Animals and Carbon and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Cestoda/*isolation & purification and Cestode Infections/*veterinary and Cyprinidae/*parasitology and Ecosystem and Food Chain and Host-Parasite Interactions and Liver/*parasitology and Muscles/*parasitology and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Nutritional Status,2020/06/23 06:00,10.1007/s00436-020-06619-1 [pii] and 6619 [pii] and 10.1007/s00436-020-06619-1 [doi],32030511,8703571,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen-15) and 7440-44-0 (Carbon) and FDJ0A8596D (Carbon-13),Germany,NA,10.1007/s00436-020-06619-1 [doi],Cestodes and Host–parasite system and Monogeneans and Stable isotopes and Trophic relationships,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,SASOLD-0107/The authors would like to acknowledge the University of Johannesburg and for funding for the collection of samples from the Vaal Dam and providing and infrastructure for the preparation of samples for analysis./,PMC7176597,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The rate of non-native fish introductions have more than doubled over the last decades yet the effect on natural ecosystems, in the scope of biologically mediated transport and biomagnification of Hg and Hg-isotopes, is unknown. Using geochemistry (THg) and stable isotopes (N, Sr and Hg), we evaluate natal origin and trophic position of brown trout (Salmo trutta fario), as well as mercury biomagnification trends and potential pollution sources to three high-altitude lakes. Farmed trout show Hg-isotope signatures similar to marine biota whereas wild trout shows Hg-isotope signatures typical of fresh water lakes. Stocked trout initially show Hg-isotope signatures similar to marine biota. As the stocked trout age and shifts diet to a higher trophic level, THg concentrations increase and the marine Hg isotope signatures, induced via farm fish feed, shift to locally produced MeHg with lower δ(202)Hg and higher Δ(199)Hg.

Carbon stable isotope was not correlated to fish length, but positive significant correlation between δ15N values and fish length was found for the non-native piranha. Also, immature and adult S. marginatus showed low isotopic niche overlap. The correlation between fish length and δ15N, and the low trophic overlap between immature and adult, indicate that the non-native S. marginatus had ontogenetic shifts in food preference, which may be viewed as an additional mechanism underlying its successful establishment in the upper Paraná River.

Understanding iodine cycling in forest involves study of the ecosystem as a whole. In this context, we determined the (127)I contents and distribution in soil, tree compartments and atmospheric inputs during a three years in situ monitoring of a temperate beech forest stand. The iodine cycle was first characterized in terms of stocks by measuring its concentrations in: tree, litterfall, humus, soil, rainfall, throughfall, stemflow and soil solutions. Main annual fluxes (requirement, uptake and internal transfers) and forest input-output budget were also estimated using conceptual model calculations. Our findings show that: (i) soil is the main I reservoir accounting for about 99.9% of ecosystem total stock; (ii) iodine uptake by tree represents a minor fraction of the available pool in soil (<0.2%); (iii) iodine allocation between tree compartments involves low immobilization in wood and restricted location in the roots; (iv) translocation of excess iodine towards senescing foliage appears as an elimination process for trees, and (v) litterfall is a major pathway in the I biological cycling.

We hypothesized that community structure and trophic position of oribatid mites of dry grassland soils and bark of trees are similar since these habitats have similar abiotic characteristics (open, dry) compared with forest soil. Further, we hypothesized that derived taxa of oribatid mites reproducing sexually dominate on the bark of trees since species in this habitat consume living resources such as lichens. In contrast to our hypothesis, the community structure of oribatid mites differed among grassland, forest and bark indicating the existence of niche differentiation in the respective oribatid mite species. In agreement with our hypothesis, sexually reproducing taxa of oribatid mites dominated on the bark of trees whereas parthenogenetic species were more frequent in soil. Several species of bark-living oribatid mites had stable isotope signatures that were similar to lichens indicating that they feed on lichens. However, nine species that frequently occurred on tree bark did not feed on lichens according to their stable isotope signatures. No oribatid mite species could be ascribed to moss feeding. We conclude that sexual reproduction served as preadaptation for oribatid mites allowing them to exploit new habitats and new resources on the bark of trees. Abiotic factors likely are of limited importance for bark-living oribatid mites since harsh abiotic conditions are assumed to favor parthenogenesis.","Animals and Austria and Carbon Isotopes and *Ecosystem and Feeding Behavior and Female and *Food Chain and Male and Mites/*physiology and Nitrogen Isotopes and Plant Bark and Population Dynamics and Principal Component Analysis and Reproduction and Sexual Behavior, Animal and Soil and Species Specificity",2011/02/01 06:00,9366 [pii] and 10.1007/s10493-010-9366-8 [doi],20490626,8507436,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Soil),Netherlands,NA,10.1007/s10493-010-9366-8 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC2951506,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mounting evidence has confirmed the significant importance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) in nitrification, plant nitrogen availability and atmospheric N2 O emissions, but their responses to environmental perturbations in drylands remain largely unknown. Here we evaluate how the factorial combinations of irrigation and fertilization in forests and land-use change from grassland to forest affects the dynamics of AOA and AOB following a 6-year dryland field study. Potential nitrification rates and AOA and AOB abundances were significantly higher in the irrigated plots, accompanied by considerable changes in community compositions, but their responses to fertilization alone were not significant. DNA-stable isotope probing results showed increased (13) CO2 incorporation into the amoA gene of AOA, but not of AOB, in plots receiving water addition, coupled with significantly higher net mineralization and nitrification rates. High-throughput microarray analysis revealed that active AOA assemblages belonging to Nitrosopumilus and Nitrosotalea were increasingly labelled by (13) CO2 following irrigation. However, no obvious effects of land-use changes on nitrification rates or metabolic activity of AOA and AOB could be observed under dry conditions. We provide evidence that water addition had more important roles than nitrogen fertilization in influencing the autotrophic nitrification in dryland ecosystems, and AOA are increasingly involved in ammonia oxidation when dry soils become wetted.",Agricultural Irrigation and Ammonia/*metabolism and Archaea/genetics/metabolism and Bacteria/genetics/metabolism and *Ecosystem and Fertilizers and Grassland and Nitrification and Nitrogen/*metabolism and Nitrogen Cycle and Oxidation-Reduction and Soil/*chemistry and *Soil Microbiology and Trees/microbiology and Water/metabolism,2015/08/11 06:00,10.1111/1462-2920.12481 [doi],24725346,100883692,0 (Fertilizers) and 0 (Soil) and 059QF0KO0R (Water) and 7664-41-7 (Ammonia) and N762921K75 (Nitrogen),England,© 2014 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,10.1111/1462-2920.12481 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many tropical regions have fast growing organisms, potentially short food chains, and few industrial point sources, suggesting low Hg baselines and low rates of trophic magnification with limited risk to people. Nevertheless, insufficient work on food-web Hg has been undertaken in the tropics and fish consumption is high in some regions. We studied Hg concentrations in fishes from floodplain lakes of the Juruá River, Amazonas, Brazil with three objectives: 1) determine rates of Hg trophic magnification, 2) assess whether Hg concentrations are high enough to impact humans eating fish, and 3) determine whether there are seasonal differences in fish Hg concentrations. A total of 377 fish-muscle samples were collected from 12 floodplain lakes during the low-water (September 2018) and falling-water (June 2019) seasons and analysed for total Hg and stable nitrogen (N) isotopes. The average trophic magnification factor (increase per trophic level) was 10.1 in the low-water season and 5.4 in the falling-water season, both well above the global average for freshwaters. This high rate of trophic magnification, coupled with higher-than-expected Hg concentrations in herbivorous species, led to high concentrations (up to 17.6 ng/g dry weight) in predatory pirarucu and piranha. Nearly 70% of all samples had Hg concentrations above the recommended human-consumption guidelines. Average concentrations were 42% higher in the low-water season than the falling-water season, but differences varied by species. Since Hg concentrations are higher than expected and fish consumption in this region is high, future research should focus on Hg exposure for human populations here and in other tropical-rainforest regions, even in the absence of local point sources of Hg.","Animals and Bioaccumulation and Environmental Monitoring and Fishes and Food Chain and Humans and Lakes and *Mercury/analysis and Water/analysis and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2022/06/07 06:00,S0048-9697(22)02254-9 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155161 [doi],35421468,0330500,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and 059QF0KO0R (Water) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",Netherlands,Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, multiple environmental and biological samples were collected from a closed realgar mining area in South China. The As concentrations in the surface water, sediments and soils in the mining area were 0.62-3293 μg/L, 9.53-4543 mg/kg and 7.32-5008 mg/kg, respectively, and gradually decreased with distance from the central mining sites, indicating that historic As mining activities had an eminent impact on As contamination around the mine. The As concentrations in aquatic organisms ranged from 0.60 mg/kg to 45.75 mg/kg and varied markedly among sites and species, reflecting the influence of various physiologic and environmental factors. Arsenic species identified by liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS) were mainly organic, comprising 8% to 66% of the total As. Both the proportions and concentrations of inorganic As were positively correlated with total As. This correlation could be attributed to the higher assimilation and accumulation of inorganic As or the lower biotransformation ability of inorganic As with the increasing total As in the studied organisms. Values of δ(13)C and δ(15)N in aquatic organisms ranged from -30.59‰ to -15.07‰ and from 4.31‰ to 12.98‰, respectively, indicating multiple trophic levels and variety in the diet sources of these organisms. The δ(15)N increased distinctly in the order of planktivorous<herbivorous<omnivorous<carnivorous, which is generally consistent with the increasing trophic levels in the freshwater ecosystem. No significant correlation was observed between As concentrations and δ(15)N in the freshwater organisms, suggesting no biomagnification of As in the food web.","Animals and Aquatic Organisms and Arsenic/*analysis and Arsenicals and Bioaccumulation and China and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and Fishes and Food Chain and Isotopes and Sulfides and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*analysis",2020/07/11 06:00,S0048-9697(20)32066-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138550 [doi],32304946,0330500,"0 (Arsenicals) and 0 (Isotopes) and 0 (Sulfides) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and 56320-22-0 (arsenic disulfide) and N712M78A8G (Arsenic)",Netherlands,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The main aim of this study was to determine the impacts of seasonal riverine inputs on land-ocean Hg transport, zooplankton diet and Hg bioaccumulation in an Arctic estuary (Adventfjorden, Svalbard). The Adventelva River was a source of dissolved and particulate Hg to Adventfjorden, especially in June and July during the river's main discharge period. Stable isotope and fatty acid analyses suggest that zooplankton diet varied seasonally with diatoms dominating during the spring phytoplankton bloom in May and with increasing contributions of dinoflagellates in the summer months. In addition, there was evidence of increased terrestrial carbon utilization by zooplankton in June and July, when terrestrial particles contributed substantially to the particulate organic matter pool. Total (TotHg) and methyl Hg (MeHg) concentrations in zooplankton increased from April to August related to increased exposure to riverine inputs, and to shifts in zooplankton diet and community structure. Longer and warmer summer seasons will probably increase riverine runoff and thus Hg exposure to Arctic zooplankton.","Animals and *Mercury/analysis and Zooplankton/chemistry and Seasons and Bioaccumulation and Diet and Arctic Regions and Environmental Monitoring and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2023/11/15 06:42,S0048-9697(23)06270-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167643 [doi],37806586,0330500,"FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",Netherlands,Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

The non-point-derived NO(3)(-) in the rivers supplying the upstream threatens the aquatic ecosystem of Taihu Lake. Here, dual-stable isotopes (δ(15)N and δ(18)O) of NO(3)(-) were applied to the Bayesian model (SIAR) for quantitative source identification of reactive nitrogen (Nr) in a mixed agricultural and urban region along the complex river network of the Yangze River delta. The results showed that the NO(3)(-) concentrations in the rivers ranged from 1.09 to 4.44 mg L(-1) and decreased from the highly urbanized areas to the lakeside rural areas. The specific isotopic characteristics of four sources (atmospheric deposition, AD; chemical fertilizer, CF; manure and sewage, MS; and soil leachate, SL) by the SIAR isotope model indicated that the MS source made the greatest contribution (46.56%) to the total NO(3)(-) load, followed by SL (27.86%), CF (23.77%), and AD (1.81%). The highly urbanized areas and the hybrid areas, which contained a mix of industrialized, populated, and agricultural areas, were identified as hotspot areas with heavy Nr pollution, responsible for spatial patterns of δ(15)N-NO(3)(-) and δ(18)O-NO(3)(-). These hotspot areas were characterized by a less well-developed sewage pipeline system with high Nr emissions from cash crops. The changes in wastewater treatment level, the agricultural production structure, and meteorological changes were the main factors of spatial variation of Nr concentration and source in the upstream Taihu Lake Basin. The variation in Nr concentration across Taihu Lake would respond to these anthropogenic-driven Nr loads. These findings suggest that MS was the predominant source had the strongest effect on the overall riverine NO(3)(-) source which was the primary problem that needed to be solved.","*Rivers/chemistry and Nitrates/analysis and Oxygen Isotopes/analysis and Nitrogen/analysis and Sewage and Bayes Theorem and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring/methods and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Nitrogen Oxides and China",2022/11/10 06:00,S0269-7491(22)01652-9 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120438 [doi],36265730,8804476,"0 (Nitrates) and 0 (Oxygen Isotopes) and N762921K75 (Nitrogen) and 0 (Sewage) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Oxides)",England,Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

A non-steady state bioenergetics/toxicokinetic model was developed to simulate PCB and Hg concentrations in these two species and compared with field data. Simulations using constant whole body growth rate and constant tissue to whole body weight ratios were contrasted against simulations adopting age specific whole body and tissue/age specific growth rates for their goodness of fit to field data. The simulations using age/tissue specific growth rates demonstrated better fit to field data for PCBs compared to the constant growth rate models (22% improved R(2)), while both models explained similar variation in Hg concentration data. Both species demonstrated higher growth rates of lipids (on a daily basis) relative to whole body and protein contributing to higher growth dilution of PCBs compared to Hg. Although stable isotope data indicated some degree of diet and/or habitat shift, simulations assuming a constant diet concentration explained between 36 and 40% of the variation in fish concentrations for both contaminants and fish species. This study demonstrates that differences in the bioaccumulation rate of PCBs and Hg by Asian carp can be partially explained by differences in the growth rates of key tissue storage compartments associated with each contaminant. These differences in chemical-specific growth dilution subsequently contribute to differences in chemical retention and bioaccumulation patterns of Hg and PCBs by fish.","Age Factors and Animals and Carps/*growth & development/*metabolism and China and Computer Simulation and Mercury/*pharmacokinetics and Models, Biological and Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*pharmacokinetics and Tissue Distribution and Water/*chemistry and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*pharmacokinetics and *Water Supply",2018/12/12 06:00,S0269-7491(18)30404-4 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2018.08.067 [doi],30172121,8804476,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and 059QF0KO0R (Water) and DFC2HB4I0K (Polychlorinated Biphenyls) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",England,Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, most studies on the response of Collembola to land-use change were conducted in temperate ecosystems and focused on shifts in community composition or morphological traits, while parameters more closely linked to ecosystem functioning, such as trophic niches, received little attention. Here, we used stable isotope analysis ((13)C and (15)N) to investigate changes in the trophic structure and use of food resources by Collembola in Jambi province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region that experienced strong deforestation in the last decades. Isotopic values of Collembola from 32 sites representing four land-use systems were analyzed (rainforest, rubber agroforest, rubber (Hevea brasiliansis) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) monoculture plantations). Across Collembola species Δ(13)C values were highest in rainforest suggesting more pronounced processing of litter resources by microorganisms and consumption of these microorganisms by Collembola in this system. Lower Δ(13)C values, but high Δ(13)C variation in Collembola in oil palm plantations indicated that Collembola shifted towards herbivory and used more variable resources in this system. Small range in Δ(15)N values in Collembola species in monoculture plantations in comparison to rainforest indicated that conversion of rainforest into plantations is associated with simplification in the trophic structure of Collembola communities. This was further confirmed by generally lower isotopic niche differentiation among species in plantations. Across the studied ecosystems, atmobiotic species (Symphypleona and Paronellidae) occupied the lowest, whereas euedaphic Collembola species occupied the highest trophic position, resembling patterns in temperate forests. Some species of Paronellidae in rainforest and jungle rubber had Δ(15)N values below those of leaf litter suggesting algivory (Salina sp.1, Callyntrura sp.1 and Lepidonella sp.1), while a dominant species, Pseudosinella sp.1, had the highest Δ(15)N values in most of the land-use systems suggesting that this species at least in part lives as predator or scavenger.

The aim of this study was to relate the transfer of total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in a Gulf of St. Lawrence food web to the trophic structure, from primary consumers to seabirds, using stable nitrogen (δ(15)N) and carbon (δ(13)C) isotope analysis and physical environmental parameters. The energy reaching upper trophic level species was principally derived from pelagic primary production, with particulate organic matter (POM) at the base of the food chain. We developed a biomagnification factor (BMF) taking into account the various prey items consumed by a given predator using stable isotope mixing models. This BMF provides a more realistic estimation than when using a single prey. Lipid content, body weight, trophic level and benthic connection explained 77.4 and 80.7% of the variation in THg and MeHg concentrations, respectively in this food web. When other values were held constant, relationships with lipid and benthic connection were negative whereas relationships with trophic level and body weight were positive. Total Hg and MeHg biomagnified in this food web with biomagnification power values (slope of the relationship with δ(15)N) of 0.170 and 0.235, respectively on wet weight and 0.134 and 0.201, respectively on dry weight. Values of biomagnification power were greater for pelagic and benthopelagic species compared to benthic species whereas the opposite trend was observed for levels at the base of the food chain. This suggests that Hg would be readily bioavailable to organisms at the base of the benthic food chain, but trophic transfer would be more efficient in each trophic level of pelagic and benthopelagic food chains.","Amphipoda/metabolism and Animals and Birds/metabolism and Canada and Carbon Isotopes/analysis/metabolism and Decapoda/metabolism and *Environmental Monitoring and Fishes/metabolism and *Food Chain and Isotope Labeling and Mercury/*analysis/metabolism and Mollusca and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis/metabolism and Sea Urchins/metabolism and Seawater/*chemistry and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*analysis/metabolism and Zooplankton/metabolism",2010/10/30 06:00,S0048-9697(10)00747-3 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.07.053 [doi],20810146,0330500,"0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",Netherlands,Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The present study combines biochemical analysis with biomass density information on soft sediment taxa collected within the depositional footprint of salmon farms and at reference sites in the Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand. Distinct biochemical signatures confirmed that the flux of organic matter from salmon farms was an important subsidy for soft sediment communities. Isotopic modelling demonstrated that the proportion of biomass supported by farm-derived organic matter did not change in a consistent pattern along the 300 m gradient from each farm site, whereas the average trophic level of communities decreased with increasing proximity to farms. High variability in both the total biomass and the distribution of biomass across trophic levels occurred among sites downstream of farms and among individual farms. Consequently, estimates of basal organic matter assimilation per unit area by communities differed by several orders of magnitude among sites. Total organic matter assimilation tended to decrease with increasing proximity to farms due to a shift towards a more detrital based community. Differences in basal organic matter assimilation among farms did not appear to be directly related to local flow regime, but instead was closely linked to differences in the soft sediment community composition likely influenced by an array of anthropogenic and environmental factors. The results presented here highlight the importance of considering local variability in basal organic matter source pools, and the potential for synergistic and cumulative effects to drive changes in food web trophodynamics when assessing the impacts of aquaculture on soft sediment communities.",Animals and Aquaculture and *Geologic Sediments and New Zealand and *Salmon and Seafood,2021/04/07 06:00,S0048-9697(21)00212-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145146 [doi],33582324,0330500,NA,Netherlands,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In marine systems, although large animals that return to land can be fitted with tracking devices, minimum instrument sizes preclude deployments on small seabirds that may nevertheless be highly abundant and hence major consumers. An increasingly popular approach is to use N and C stable isotope analysis of feathers sampled at colonies to provide information on distribution and trophic level for the preceding, and generally little-known, nonbreeding period. Despite the burgeoning of this research, there have been few attempts to verify such relationships. In this study, we demonstrate a clear correspondence between isotope ratios of feathers and nonbreeding distributions of seven species from South Georgia tracked using loggers. This generated a rudimentary isoscape that was used to infer the habitat preferences of eight other species ranging in size from storm petrels to albatrosses, and which could be applied, with caveats, in other studies. Differences in inferred distribution within and between species had major implications for relative exposure to anthropogenic threats, including climate change and fisheries. Although there were no differences in isotope values between sexes in any of the smaller petrels, mean stable C (delta(13)C), but not stable N isotope ratios (delta(15)N), tended to be greater in females than males of the larger, and more sexually size-dimorphic species. This indicates a difference in C source (distribution), rather than trophic level, and a correspondence between the degree of sexual size dimorphism in Procellariiformes and the level of between-sex niche segregation.",Analysis of Variance and Animal Migration/*physiology and Animals and Atlantic Islands and Birds/*physiology and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and *Ecosystem and Feathers/chemistry and Female and *Food Chain and Homing Behavior/*physiology and Male and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Sex Factors and Species Specificity,2009/09/10 06:00,10.1007/s00442-009-1342-9 [doi],19377898,0150372,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),Germany,NA,10.1007/s00442-009-1342-9 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Invasion-mediated vegetation changes can depress terrestrial arthropod communities and alter arthropod flux across the aquatic-terrestrial interface. We investigated the effects of a non-native woody plant, Robinia neomexicana, on insect contributions to riparian songbird diets. This plant was introduced over 100 years ago to the Clear Creek drainage in northwestern Colorado (USA) from its native range, which extends into southern Colorado. We used stable isotope analysis of insects and avian feces to 1) assess whether the relative contributions of aquatic- and terrestrial-derived arthropod prey differed between reference sites and sites invaded by R. neomexicana, and 2) quantify the amount of aquatic- and terrestrial-derived resources consumed by an insectivorous songbird assemblage. Two species of insectivorous songbirds consumed more aquatic insects in invaded sites compared to reference sites. This change in terrestrial- and aquatic-derived prey in bird diets in response to a near-range plant invasion suggests that the introduction of novel species from more distant native ranges could produce similar or stronger effects. Overall, the songbird community consumed approximately 34% aquatic resources, which highlights the importance of these subsidies to riparian consumers. Our investigation of insect subsidies demonstrates how introduced species can indirectly affect food webs and provides insight into the plasticity of riparian consumer responses.","Animals and Carbon/metabolism and Colorado and *Food Chain and Insecta/growth & development and *Introduced Species and *Models, Biological and Robinia/*growth & development and Songbirds/*physiology",2019/04/17 06:00,PONE-D-18-20628 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0207389 [doi],30481226,101285081,7440-44-0 (Carbon),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0207389 [doi] and e0207389,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC6258477,"This research was financially supported by Chevron Corporation, Colorado Field and Ornithologists, the Warner College of Natural Resources, and the Graduate Degree and Program in Ecology at Colorado State University.

We use stable isotope data from stalagmites from northwest Madagascar coupled with radiocarbon and butchery records from subfossil bones across the island to investigate relationships between megafaunal decline, climate change, and habitat modification. Archaeological and genetic evidence support human presence by 2000 years Before Common Era (BCE). Megafaunal decline was at first slow; it hastened at ∼700 Common Era (CE) and peaked between 750 and 850 CE, just before a dramatic vegetation transformation in the northwest that resulted in the replacement of C(3) woodland habitat with C(4) grasslands, during a period of heightened monsoonal activity. Cut and chop marks on subfossil lemur bones reveal a shift in primary hunting targets from larger, now-extinct species prior to ∼900 CE, to smaller, still-extant species afterwards. By 1050 CE, megafaunal populations had essentially collapsed. Neither the rapid megafaunal decline beginning ∼700 CE, nor the dramatic vegetation transformation in the northwest beginning ∼890 CE, was influenced by aridification. However, both roughly coincide with a major transition in human subsistence on the island from hunting/foraging to herding/farming. We offer a new hypothesis, which we call the ""Subsistence Shift Hypothesis,"" to explain megafaunal decline and extinction in Madagascar. This hypothesis acknowledges the importance of wild-animal hunting by early hunter/foragers, but more critically highlights negative impacts of the shift from hunting/foraging to herding/farming, settlement by new immigrant groups, and the concomitant expansion of the island's human population. The interval between 700 and 900 CE, when the pace of megafaunal decline quickened and peaked, coincided with this economic transition.

The consequences of these shifts are not well known, and consumption of reliable-but low quality-anthropogenic food may present important trade-offs for wildlife health. This may be especially true for carnivorous species such as the American white ibis (Eudocimus albus), a nomadic wading bird which has been increasingly observed in urban parks in South Florida, USA. We tested the effects of anthropogenic provisioning on consumer nutrition (i.e. dietary protein), body condition and ectoparasite burdens along an urban gradient using stable isotope analysis, scaled mass index values and GPS transmitter data. Ibises that assimilated more provisioned food were captured at more urban sites, used more urban habitat, had lower mass-length residuals, lower ectoparasite scores, assimilated less δ15N and had smaller dietary isotopic ellipses. Our results suggest that ibises in urban areas are heavily provisioned with anthropogenic food, which appears to offer a trade-off by providing low-quality, but easily accessible, calories that may not support high mass but may increase time available for anti-parasite behaviours such as preening. Understanding such trade-offs is important for investigating the effects of provisioning on infection risk and the conservation of wildlife in human-modified habitats.This article is part of the theme issue 'Anthropogenic resource subsidies and host-parasite dynamics in wildlife'.","Animal Feed/*supply & distribution and Animal Migration/*physiology and Animals and Animals, Wild and Birds/parasitology/*physiology and Diet and Dietary Proteins/administration & dosage/analysis and Ecosystem and Ectoparasitic Infestations/epidemiology/parasitology/*veterinary and Feeding Behavior/*physiology and Florida/epidemiology and Grooming/physiology and Mites/physiology and Nitrogen Isotopes/metabolism and Phthiraptera/physiology and Population Dynamics and Seasons and Urbanization",2019/02/02 06:00,rstb.2017.0100 [pii] and rstb20170100 [pii] and 10.1098/rstb.2017.0100 [doi],29531152,7503623,0 (Dietary Proteins) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),England,© 2018 The Author(s).,10.1098/rstb.2017.0100 [doi] and 20170100,body condition and disease ecology and ectoparasite and provisioning and stable isotope analysis and urban wildlife,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,PMC5883003,"We have no competing interests but are research collaborators with Daniel Becker, and Sonia Altizer and Richard Hall.",NA,figshare/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3982638,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To date, however, little information is available on tropical urban environments where inorganic nitrogen is vastly transported and deposited through precipitation on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. To fill this gap, we present compositions of water stable isotopes in precipitation and atmospheric nitrate (δ(18)O-H(2)O, δ(2)H-H(2)O, δ(15)N-NO(3)(-), and δ(18)O-NO(3)(-)) collected daily between August 2018 and November 2019 in a tropical urban atmosphere of central Costa Rica. Rainfall generation processes (convective and stratiform rainfall fractions) were identified using stable isotopes in precipitation coupled with air mass back trajectory analysis. A Bayesian isotope mixing model using δ(15)N-NO(3)(-) compositions and corrected for potential (15)N fractionation effects revealed the contribution of lightning (25.9 ± 7.1%), biomass burning (21.8 ± 6.6%), gasoline (19.1 ± 6.4%), diesel (18.4 ± 6.0%), and soil biogenic emissions (15.0 ± 2.6%) to nitrate wet deposition. δ(18)O-NO(3)(-) values reflect the oxidation of NO(x) sources via the ·OH + RO(2) pathways. These findings provide necessary baseline information about the combination of water and nitrogen stable isotopes with atmospheric chemistry and hydrometeorological techniques to better understand wet deposition processes and to characterize the origin and magnitude of inorganic nitrogen loadings in tropical regions.","Atmosphere and Bayes Theorem and Costa Rica and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and *Nitrates/analysis and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Oxygen Isotopes/analysis and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2021/12/15 06:00,10.1007/s11356-021-15327-x [pii] and 10.1007/s11356-021-15327-x [doi],34258705,9441769,"0 (Nitrates) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Oxygen Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",Germany,"© 2021.

We predict the spatial variability of grass δ(13)C in North America using a mean of three different methods of classification and regression tree (CART) machine learning techniques and nine climatic variables. We show that growing season precipitation and temperature are the strongest predictors of all single climate variables. We apply this CART analysis to high-resolution gridded climate data and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) mean paleoclimate model outputs to produce predictive isotope landscape models (""isoscapes"") for the current, mid-Holocene, and LGM average δ(13)C of grass-dominated areas across North America. From the LGM to the present, C4 grass abundances substantially increased in the Great Plains despite concurrent increases in atmospheric CO2.

A detailed and greatly expanded Adélie penguin dietary record dated back to 7,200 years BP has been reconstructed for the investigated area. Our data indicate a significant dietary shift between fish and krill, with a gradual decrease from past to present time in the proportion of fish compared to krill in Adélie penguin diet. From 7,200 to 2,000 years BP, δ(13)C and δ(15)N values indicate fish as the most eaten prey. The dietary contribution of lower-trophic prey in penguin diet started becoming evident not earlier than 2,000 years BP, when the δ(13)C values reveal a change in the penguin feeding behavior. Modern eggshell and guano samples reveal a major dietary contribution of krill but not a krill-dominated diet, since δ(13)C values remain much too high if krill prevail in the diet. According to the Holocene environmental background attested for Victoria Land, Adélie penguin dietary shifts between fish and krill seem to reflect penguin paleoecological responses to different paleoenvironmental settings with different conditions of sea-ice extension and persistence. Furthermore, Adélie penguin diet appears to be particularly affected by environmental changes in a very specific period within the breeding season, namely the egg-laying period when penguin dietary and feeding habit shifts are clearly documented by the δ(13)C of eggshell carbonate.",Animals and Antarctic Regions and Breeding and Carbon Isotopes/*analysis/metabolism and Carbonates/analysis/metabolism and Climate Change and Diet/*veterinary and *Ecosystem and Egg Shell/chemistry/metabolism and Nitrogen Isotopes/*analysis/metabolism and Oceans and Seas and *Paleontology and Seasons and Spheniscidae/*physiology and Victoria,2011/02/26 06:00,10.1007/s00442-010-1790-2 [doi],20886238,0150372,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Carbonates) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),Germany,NA,10.1007/s00442-010-1790-2 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For example, riparian woodland is advocated widely as shade to reduce warming in temperate streams, but few studies have considered collateral effects on species composition or ecosystem functions. Here, we use cross-sectional analyses at two scales (region and within streams) to investigate whether four types of riparian management, including those proposed to reduce potential climate change impacts, might also affect the composition, functional character, dynamics and energetic resourcing of macroinvertebrates in upland Welsh streams (UK). Riparian land use across the region had only small effects on invertebrate taxonomic composition, while stable isotope data showed how energetic resources assimilated by macroinvertebrates in all functional guilds were split roughly 50:50 between terrestrial and aquatic origins irrespective of riparian management. Nevertheless, streams draining the most extensive deciduous woodland had the greatest stocks of coarse particulate matter (CPOM) and greater numbers of 'shredding' detritivores. Stream-scale investigations showed that macroinvertebrate biomass in deciduous woodland streams was around twice that in moorland streams, and lowest of all in streams draining non-native conifers. The unexpected absence of contrasting terrestrial signals in the isotopic data implies that factors other than local land use affect the relative incorporation of allochthonous subsidies into riverine food webs.

Over the past two decades, much research has been devoted to examining the influence of warming on SOM decomposition in topsoil. Most SOM, however, is old and stored in subsoil. The fate of subsoil SOM under future warming remains highly uncertain. Here, by combining a long-term field warming experiment and a meta-analysis study, we showed that warming significantly increased SOM decomposition in subsoil. We also showed that a decade of warming promoted decomposition of subsoil SOM with turnover times of decades to millennia in a tall grass prairie and this effect was largely associated with shifts in the functional gene structure of microbial communities. By coupling stable isotope probing with metagenomics, we found that microbial communities in warmed soils possessed a higher relative abundance of key functional genes involved in the degradation of organic materials with varying recalcitrance than those in control soils.

Stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon were analyzed in samples and used to establish trophic structure of the food web and to determine the importance of atmospheric versus sedimentary sources in delivering PCBs to the food web. Nitrogen isotopes were confounded by multiple variables in this system, particularly seasonal variation, and did not display a simple pattern of enrichment among trophic levels. However, delta13C displayed little seasonal variation and was positively correlated with PCB concentrations among food web members (r2 = 0.69). Plots of delta13C vs PCBs separate food web members into three distinct groupings comprised of invertebrates, primary forage fish, and predatory fish. Stable isotope values of the primary organic sources indicate that the atmosphere, and not the sediment, is the most likely source of PCBs to the food web of Lake Michigan. Additionally, we suggest that seston may be important in delivering PCBs to pelagic food web members and species that receive a majority of their nutrition through pelagic sources.

Concentrations of the dominant PBDE congeners (BDEs 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, and 154) increased significantly from 1979 until the mid-1990s, then either leveled off or decreased significantly between 1998 and 2004, a result that corresponds to those of previous studies.

This is in part because quantifying trophic linkages is a challenge, especially for small organisms with cryptic feeding behaviors such as insects, and often relies on conducting labor-intensive feeding trials or extensive observations in the field. In this study, we used stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to examine how disturbance (annual biomass harvesting) in tallgrass prairies affected the trophic position, trophic range, and niche space of ants, a widespread grassland consumer. We hypothesized that biomass harvest would remove important food and nesting resources of insects thus affecting ant feeding relationships and trophic structure. We found shifts in the feeding relationships inferred by isotopic signatures with harvest. In particular, these shifts suggest that ants within harvest sites utilized resources at lower trophic levels (possibly plant-based resources or herbivores), expanded trophic breadth, and occupied different niche spaces. Shifts in resource use following harvest could be due to harvest-mediated changes in both the plant and arthropod communities that might affect the strength of competition or alter plant nitrogen availability.

Essential trace elements were observed to be offloaded at higher concentrations to embryos, with the exception of Zn and Ni in liver, while nonessential trace elements were unevenly distributed between maternal-embryo tissues. Observed Hg concentrations were at levels considered toxic in A. pelagicus, but the Se: Hg molar ratios in all embryonic tissues were all greater than one. A negative correlation was observed between transfer ratios and concentrations of all elements in maternal tissue, indicating the existence of a regulatory mechanism in maternal ovaries of A. pelagicus.

Negative correlations were observed between δ(13)C, δ(15)N, and Δδ(13)C values and precaudal length in embryonic muscle tissue potentially reflecting either a dietary-habitat shift in pregnant females during the latter period of gestation or a physiological change modifying fractionation.

Soft tissues of dead vertebrates are rapidly decomposed by diverse animals. However, decomposition of hard tissues such as hairs and feathers is much slower because only a few animals can digest keratin, a protein that is concentrated in hairs and feathers. Although beetles of the family Trogidae are considered keratin feeders, their ecological function has rarely been explored. Here, we investigated the keratin-decomposition function of trogid beetles in heron-breeding colonies where keratin was frequently supplied as feathers. Three trogid species were collected from the colonies and observed feeding on heron feathers under laboratory conditions. We also measured the nitrogen (δ(15)N) and carbon (δ(13)C) stable isotope ratios of two trogid species that were maintained on a constant diet (feathers from one heron individual) during 70 days under laboratory conditions. We compared the isotopic signatures of the trogids with the feathers to investigate isotopic shifts from the feathers to the consumers for δ(15)N and δ(13)C. We used mixing models (MixSIR and SIAR) to estimate the main diets of individual field-collected trogid beetles.

When abundant, seabirds feeding in the open ocean transport large quantities of nutrients onto islands, enhancing the productivity of island fauna and flora(3,4). Whether leaching of these nutrients back into the sea influences the productivity, structure and functioning of adjacent coral reef ecosystems is not known. Here we address this question using a rare natural experiment in the Chagos Archipelago, in which some islands are rat-infested and others are rat-free. We found that seabird densities and nitrogen deposition rates are 760 and 251 times higher, respectively, on islands where humans have not introduced rats. Consequently, rat-free islands had substantially higher nitrogen stable isotope (δ(15)N) values in soils and shrubs, reflecting pelagic nutrient sources. These higher values of δ(15)N were also apparent in macroalgae, filter-feeding sponges, turf algae and fish on adjacent coral reefs. Herbivorous damselfish on reefs adjacent to the rat-free islands grew faster, and fish communities had higher biomass across trophic feeding groups, with 48% greater overall biomass. Rates of two critical ecosystem functions, grazing and bioerosion, were 3.2 and 3.8 times higher, respectively, adjacent to rat-free islands. Collectively, these results reveal how rat introductions disrupt nutrient flows among pelagic, island and coral reef ecosystems. Thus, rat eradication on oceanic islands should be a high conservation priority as it is likely to benefit terrestrial ecosystems and enhance coral reef productivity and functioning by restoring seabird-derived nutrient subsidies from large areas of ocean.",Animals and Anthozoa/*physiology and Aquatic Organisms/metabolism and Biomass and Birds/*physiology and Charadriiformes/physiology and *Coral Reefs and Data Analysis and Fishes/metabolism and *Food Chain and Herbivory and Indian Ocean and *Introduced Species and Islands and Nitrogen/metabolism and Porifera/metabolism and Rats and Seaweed/metabolism,2019/01/15 06:00,10.1038/s41586-018-0202-3 [pii] and 10.1038/s41586-018-0202-3 [doi],29995864,0410462,N762921K75 (Nitrogen),England,NA,10.1038/s41586-018-0202-3 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Nature. 2018 Jul;559(7713):190-191.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) have thus become an indispensable tool for the protection of these marine predators. Two recently-created MPAs in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, the Revillagigedo National Park and Clipperton Atoll, are characterized by different trophic structures potentially influencing the trophic niche and contaminant exposure of resident sharks in these two sites. In this context, we used carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) stable isotope analyzes as well as total mercury concentrations ([THg]) to assess the effect of foraging site on the trophic niche and Hg levels of juvenile silvertip (ST) sharks Carcharhinus albimarginatus. Analyzing fin clip samples from Revillagigedo and Clipperton, we found that shark δ(15)N varied spatially in relation to δ(15)N baselines, suggesting similar trophic position in both MPAs. Moreover, δ(13)C values indicated that ST sharks from Revillagigedo would feed on different food webs (i.e. both benthic and pelagic) while individuals from Clipperton would only rely on benthic food webs. These differences between MPAs led to a weak overlap of isotopic niches between the two populations, highlighting the site residency of juvenile ST sharks. Within each population, [THg] was not correlated with trophic tracers (δ(15)N and δ(13)C) and was also similar between populations. This study revealed no influence of site or food web in [THg] and raises the question of the origin of Hg exposure for reef shark populations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean.","Animals and Conservation of Natural Resources and Fisheries and Food Chain and Isotopes and Mercury/metabolism/*toxicity and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Pacific Ocean and Seafood and Sharks/*physiology and Water Pollutants, Chemical/metabolism/*toxicity",2020/06/25 06:00,S0045-6535(20)30838-9 [pii] and 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126645 [doi],32283423,0320657,"0 (Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",England,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Threadfin shad competitively displaced other planktivorous fish in the lake, such as inland silversides, young-of-year (YOY) largemouth bass, and YOY bluegill, by reducing zooplankton abundance. As a result, all three species shifted from a diet that was dominated by zooplankton to one that was almost entirely zoobenthos. Stable carbon isotopes corroborated this pattern with each species becoming enriched in delta13C, which is elevated in benthic vs. pelagic organisms. Concomitant with these changes, Hg concentrations increased by approximately 50% in all three species. In contrast, obligate benthivores such as prickly sculpin showed no relationship between diet or delta13C and the presence of threadfin shad, suggesting that effects of the shad were not strongly linked to the benthic fish community. There were also no changes in Hg concentrations of prickly sculpin. The temporary extirpation of threadfin shad from the lake resulted in zooplankton densities, foraging patterns, isotope ratios, and Hg concentrations in pelagic fishes returning to pre-shad values. These results indicate that even transient perturbations of the structure of freshwater food webs can result in significant alterations in the bioaccumulation of Hg and that food webs in lakes can be highly resilient.","Animals and California and Diet and Feeding Behavior/physiology and Fishes/*physiology and *Food Chain and Fresh Water/chemistry and Mercury/chemistry/*metabolism and Mining and Plankton/*metabolism and Population Dynamics and Time Factors and Water Pollutants, Chemical/chemistry/*metabolism",2009/06/19 09:00,10.1890/06-1415.1 [doi],19475926,9889808,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Commonly assumed to benefit cold-limited invasive alien species, these climatic changes may also change their feeding preferences, especially in the case of omnivorous ectotherms. We investigated heat wave effects on diet choice, growth and energy reserves in the invasive red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. In laboratory experiments, we fed juvenile and adult crayfish on animal, plant or mixed diets and exposed them to a short or a long heat wave. We then measured crayfish survival, growth, body reserves and Fulton's condition index. Diet choices of the crayfish maintained on the mixed diet were estimated using stable isotopes (13C and 15N). The results suggest a decreased efficiency of carnivorous diets at higher temperatures, as juveniles fed on the animal diet were unable to maintain high growth rates in the long heat wave; and a decreased efficiency of herbivorous diets at lower temperatures, as juveniles in the cold accumulated less body reserves when fed on the plant diet. Heat wave treatments increased the assimilation of plant material, especially in juveniles, allowing them to sustain high growth rates in the long heat wave. Contrary to our expectations, crayfish performance decreased in the long heat wave, suggesting that Mediterranean summer heat waves may have negative effects on P. clarkii and that they are unlikely to boost its populations in this region. Although uncertain, it is possible that the greater assimilation of the plant diet resulted from changes in crayfish feeding preferences, raising the hypotheses that i) heat waves may change the predominant impacts of this keystone species and ii) that by altering species' trophic niches, climate change may alter the main impacts of invasive alien species.",Animals and Astacoidea/*physiology and Carbon Isotopes and *Diet and *Food Chain and *Hot Temperature and *Introduced Species and Linear Models and Nitrogen Isotopes,2017/10/17 06:00,PONE-D-17-12131 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0183108 [doi],28873401,101285081,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0183108 [doi] and e0183108,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC5584761,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Biological interactions that affect mercury bioaccumulation are especially relevant as fish assemblages change in response to species introductions and lake management practices. We studied the influence of shifting food web dynamics on mercury in fisheries of Little Moose Lake in the southwestern Adirondack Mountains of New York, USA. Annual removal of non-native Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu) has been used as a management strategy since 2000 to restore the native fish assemblage and food web in favor of Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Changes in total mercury, stable carbon ((13)C/(12)C) and nitrogen ((15)N/(14)N) isotopes, and growth were evaluated for Lake Trout and Smallmouth Bass. Growth rates increased for both predators and trophic position increased for Lake Trout post-removal. Mercury concentrations in Lake Trout increased over the 16-year study period influenced by a diet shift from invertebrates to higher trophic level prey fish, regardless of increased growth. Smallmouth Bass mercury concentrations decreased with compensatory growth from a reduced population size. These contrasting trends indicate that changes in mercury deposition were not the primary driver for mercury bioaccumulation responses in Little Moose Lake. Stable isotope values changed for both predators and for several lower trophic level organisms, likely reflecting changes in nutrient cycling and/or inputs. Our findings emphasize the potential role of fisheries management on whole-lake and predatory fish responses to mercury contamination in temperate lakes.","Animals and Bass and *Environmental Monitoring and *Fisheries and Fishes/*metabolism and Food Chain and Invertebrates and Lakes and Mercury/*metabolism and New York and Trout and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*metabolism",2020/11/20 06:00,10.1007/s10646-019-02156-5 [pii] and 10.1007/s10646-019-02156-5 [doi],31925620,9885956,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",United States,NA,10.1007/s10646-019-02156-5 [doi],Adirondacks and Food webs and Lake Trout and Mercury bioaccumulation and Smallmouth Bass,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the capability of microarthropods to shift their trophic niches is little studied. Whereas some studies based on stable isotopes ((15)N/(13)C) point to distinct and narrow trophic niches, others indicate that trophic niches are plastic. Here, we investigated shifts in trophic niches of oribatid mites (Oribatida, Acari), a major soil detritivore microarthropod group, due to forest management, i.e., plantation of beech and spruce forests in Central Europe, using neutral lipid fatty acid (NLFA) markers. Due to differential microbial communities, we expected a fungi-based diet of oribatid mites in beech forest, but more bacterial contributions to the diet in spruce forest. Supporting these hypotheses, NLFA markers indicated that the trophic niches of each of the studied oribatid mite species differed between beech and spruce forests and shifted from feeding predominantly on litter and fungi in beech forest to more intensively feeding on bacteria in spruce forest. Oribatid mite species with the most pronounced differences in trophic niches included Achipteria coleoptrata, Eupelops hirtus, Eupelops plicatus and Liacarus xylariae, which had been classified as primary or secondary decomposers in previous studies. Overall, the results indicate that the ability of oribatid mite species to colonize different habitats and ecosystems is due to their ability to adjust their diet, i.e., to trophic plasticity. Changes in trophic niches in each of the studied oribatid mite species suggest that detritivores in soil may better cope with future changes in environmental conditions and associated changes in resource composition than species above the ground.",Animals and Diet and Europe and Fatty Acids/*analysis and *Forests and *Mites and Soil,2020/07/25 06:00,10.1007/s10493-020-00494-2 [pii] and 494 [pii] and 10.1007/s10493-020-00494-2 [doi],32347428,8507436,0 (Fatty Acids) and 0 (Soil),Netherlands,NA,10.1007/s10493-020-00494-2 [doi],Global change and NLFA and Oribatida and Trophic niche,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,MA-2461/7-4/German Research Foundation (DFG)/,PMC7203090,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both pastures consisted exclusively of C(3) plants. Before the experiment, all animals grazed a common pasture for 6 wk. Grasses and perirenal adipose tissues of the sheep were analyzed for fatty acids by gas chromatography. Stable C-isotope ratios (δ(13)C values in ‰ vs. the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite standard) were determined in the composite samples by elemental analysis-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The δ(13)C of the individual fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The δ(13)C value of the entire mountain pasture grass was -27.5‰ (SD 0.31), whereas that of the lowland pasture grass was -30.0‰ (SD 0.07). This difference was reflected in the perirenal adipose tissues of the corresponding sheep (P < 0.05), even though the δ(13)C values were less in the animals than in the grass. The δ(13)C values for cis-9 16:1 and cis-9 18:1 in perirenal fat differed between mountain and lowland lambs (P < 0.05). The 16:0 in the adipose tissue was enriched in (13)C by 5‰ compared with the dietary 16:0, likely as a result of partly endogenous synthesis. The δ(13)C values of cis-9,trans-11 18:2 (cis-9,trans-11 CLA) in the adipose tissue were smaller than those of its dietary precursors, cis-9,cis-12 18:2 and cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3; conversely, the δ(13)C values of trans-11 18:1 were not, suggesting that large proportions of perirenal cis-9,trans-11 18:2 were of endogenous origin and discrimination against (13)C occurred during Δ(9)-desaturation. The same discrimination was indicated by the isotopic shift between 16:0 and cis-9 16:1 in the mountain grazing group. Furthermore, the δ(13)C values of cis-9,trans-11 18:2 were smaller relative to the precursor fatty acids in the mountain lambs compared with the lowland group. This result suggests a reduced extent of biohydrogenation in lambs grazing on mountain grass in comparison with those grazing on lowland grass. This was supported by the smaller cis-9,trans-11 18:2 concentrations in total fatty acids found in the adipose tissues of the lowland lambs (P < 0.001). The results of this study demonstrate that natural differences between δ(13)C values of swards from different pastures and the adipose tissue fatty acids could be used as tracers in studies of lipid metabolism in ruminants.",Animal Feed/analysis and Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena and Animals and Carbon/*chemistry/metabolism and Carbon Isotopes/chemistry/metabolism and Diet/veterinary and Fatty Acids/*chemistry/*metabolism and Intra-Abdominal Fat/*chemistry/*metabolism and Male and Sheep/*physiology,2012/07/10 06:00,jas.2011-4284 [pii] and 10.2527/jas.2011-4284 [doi],22021810,8003002,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Fatty Acids) and 7440-44-0 (Carbon),United States,NA,10.2527/jas.2011-4284 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Prior studies investigated the relationship between ASGM activities and downstream Hg pollution relying primarily on Hg concentration data. In this study, Hg isotopes revealed an isotopically heavy Hg signature with negligible mass independent fractionation (MIF) in downstream sediments, which was consistent with the signature observed in the ASGM source endmember. This signature was traced as far as ∼120 km downstream of Portovelo-Zaruma, demonstrating that Hg stable isotopes can be used as a tool to fingerprint and trace sources of Hg over vast distances in freshwater environments. The success of Hg isotopes as a source tracer in fresh waters is largely due to the particle-reactive nature of Hg. Furthermore, the magnitude and extent of downstream Hg, lead, copper and zinc contamination coupled with the Hg isotopes suggest that it is unlikely that the smaller artisanal-scale activities, which do not use cyanidation, are responsible for the pollution. More likely it is the scale of ores processed and the cyanide leaching, which can release other metals and enhance Hg transport, used during small-scale gold mining that is responsible. Thus, although artisanal- and small-scale gold mining occur in tandem in Portovelo-Zaruma, a distinction should be made between these two activities.","Ecosystem and Environmental Exposure/*analysis and Environmental Pollution/*analysis and Mercury/*analysis/chemistry and Mercury Isotopes/*analysis and Mining and Peru and Rivers/*chemistry and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*analysis",2018/08/01 06:00,S0045-6535(18)30495-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.03.081 [doi],29609178,0320657,"0 (Mercury Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",England,Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios were also determined in the samples. Organochlorine compounds concentration was found to be uniform throughout the year in farmed fish, in both white muscle and liver. In contrast, wild fish showed contamination profiles that reflect environmental factors and the biological cycle. Although biomagnification factors for white muscle and liver were found to be 2.4 and 3.0, respectively for farmed fish, and 0.15 and 0.54 for wild specimens, wild fish presented higher levels of organochlorine contaminants than farmed fish. Nitrogen stable isotopes determination in muscle from wild and farmed sea bream during the year gave us a profile related to the biological cycle. delta(15)N mean values from farmed fish were 2.0 per thousand higher than from wild fish throughout the year that corresponding to close to one trophic step. delta(13)C values were stable during the year, and also more enriched in the case of farmed fish.

To assess how freshwater communities respond to such profound changes in their habitat and resource availability, we conducted a space-for-time analysis of food-web structure in 30 lakes situated across a temperature-productivity gradient equivalent to the predicted future climate of subarctic Europe (temperature +3°C, precipitation +30% and nutrient +45 μg L(-1) total phosphorus). Along this gradient, we observed an increase in the assimilation of pelagic-derived carbon from 25 to 75% throughout primary, secondary and tertiary consumers. This shift was overwhelmingly driven by the consumption of pelagic detritus by benthic primary consumers and was not accompanied by increased pelagic foraging by higher trophic level consumers. Our data also revealed a convergence of the carbon isotope ratios of pelagic and benthic food web endmembers in the warmest, most productive lakes indicating that the incorporation of terrestrial derived carbon into aquatic food webs increases as land use intensifies.

We examined the effects of deforestation and subsequent afforestation of a riparian forest of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) on stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ¹³C) and nitrogen (δ¹⁵N) and natural abundances of radiocarbon (Δ¹⁴C) in stream biota in the Mt. Gomadan Experimental Forest and the Wakayama Forest Research Station, Kyoto University, central Japan. Macroinvertebrates, periphytic algae attached to rock surfaces (periphyton), and leaf litter of terrestrial plants were collected from six headwater streams with similar climate, topography, and bedrock geology, except for the stand ages of riparian forests (from 3 to 49 yr old in five stands and > 90 yr old in one reference stand). Light intensity and δ¹³C values of both periphyton and macroinvertebrates decreased synchronously with forest age in winter. A Bayesian mixing model indicates that periphyton contributions to the stream food webs are maximized in 23-yr-old forests. Except for grazers, most macroinvertebrates showed Δ¹⁴C values similar to those of terrestrial leaf litter, reflecting the influence of modern atmospheric CO₂ Δ¹⁴C values. On the other hand, the Δ¹⁴C values of both periphyton and grazers (i.e., aquatic primary consumers) were significantly lower than that of modern atmospheric CO₂, and were lowest in 23-yr-old forest stands. Previous studies show that root biomass of C. japonica peaks at 15-30 yr after planting. These evidences suggest that soil CO₂ released by root respiration and dispersed by groundwater weathers carbonate substrata, and that dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with low Δ¹⁴C is incorporated into stream periphyton and some macroinvertebrates. The ecological response in the studied streams to clear-cutting and replanting of Japanese cedar is much slower (~20 yr) than the chemical response (< 5 yr). More than 50 yr is required for the food web structure to completely recover from clear-cutting.

Salt marshes represent such boundary habitats, characterized by frequent inundations increasing from the terrestrial upper to the marine pioneer zone. Despite the high abundance of soil mesofauna in salt marshes and their important function by facilitating energy and carbon flows, the structure, trophic ecology and habitat-related diet shifts of mesofauna species in natural salt marsh habitats is virtually unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effects of natural disturbance (inundation frequency) on community structure, food web complexity and resource use of soil mesofauna using stable isotope analysis (15N, 13C) in three salt marsh zones. In this intertidal habitat, the pioneer zone is exposed to inundations twice a day, but lower and upper salt marshes are less frequently inundated based on shore height. The mesofauna comprised 86 species / taxa dominated by Collembola, Oribatida and Mesostigmata. Shifts in environmental disturbances influenced the structure of food webs, diversity and density declined strongly from the land to the sea pointing to the importance of increasing levels of inundation frequency. Accordingly, the reduced diversity and density was associated by a simplification of the food web in the pioneer zone as compared to the less inundated lower and upper salt marsh with a higher number of trophic levels. Strong variations in δ15N signatures demonstrated that mesofauna species are feeding at multiple trophic levels. Primary decomposers were low and most mesofauna species functioned as secondary decomposers or predators including second order predators or scavengers. The results document that major decomposer taxa, such as Collembola and Oribatida, are more diverse than previously assumed and predominantly dwell on autochthonous resources of the respective salt marsh zone. The results further suggest that Mesostigmata mostly adopt an intraguild predation lifestyle. The high trophic position of a large number of predators suggests that intraguild predation is of significant importance in salt marsh food webs. Presumably, intraguild predation contributes to stabilizing the salt marsh food web against disturbances.",Animals and Biodiversity and *Food Chain and Germany and Humans and Predatory Behavior and *Soil and *Wetlands,2017/12/30 06:00,PONE-D-17-25249 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0189645 [doi],29240806,101285081,0 (Soil),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0189645 [doi] and e0189645,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC5730192,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant, which can biomagnify along marine and freshwater food webs. Therefore, mercury body burden in seabirds, such as gulls, will integrate information about pollution in the environment. In the Ebro Delta (NE Spain), legacy mercury pollution from a chlor-alkali industry located ca. 100 km upstream of the Ebro river mouth has been affecting the delta environment. We have analyzed a 15-year temporal series (2004-2019) of Hg in birds from a breeding colony of Audouin's gull (Ichthyaetus audouinii) in the Ebro Delta to understand how fluctuations in Hg levels are coupled to human activities in the industrial area in the upstream region of the river. Stable isotopic signatures of C and N (δ(13)C(bulk) and δ(15)N(bulk)) are determined to characterize the trophic ecology of the species. Since only δ(13)C(bulk) but not δ(15)N(bulk) was associated with THg levels, we used compound-specific stable nitrogen isotope analysis of amino acids (AA-CSIA) to evaluate the causes of variation in δ(15)N(bulk) to further investigate the idea of a decoupling of δ(15)N(bulk) and THg over time.

However, it is still unclear which compartment is the major source or sink due to the lack of estimation and comparison of the net methylmercury (MeHg) production or degradation in these compartments. The lack of this information has limited our understanding of Hg cycling in this ecosystem. This study adopted a double stable isotope ((199)Hg(2+) and Me(201)Hg) addition technique to determine the methylation/demethylation rate constants and the net MeHg production rates in each compartment. This study improved the previous models for estimating these parameters by (1) taking into account the difference between newly input and ambient mercury in methylation/demethylation efficiency and (2) correcting the contribution of photodemethylation to Me(199)Hg concentration when calculating methylation rates in water. The net MeHg production rate in each compartment was then estimated to identify the major sources and sinks of MeHg. The results indicate that these improvements in modeling are necessary, as a significant error would occur otherwise. Soil was identified to be the largest source of MeHg in the Everglades, while the floc and water column were identified as the major sinks. The role of periphyton varies, appearing to be a source in the northern Everglades and a sink in the southern Everglades. Soil could be the largest source for MeHg in the water column, while methylation in periphyton could also contribute significantly in the northern Everglades.","Biodegradation, Environmental and *Ecosystem and *Environmental Monitoring and Flocculation and Florida and Kinetics and Mercury Isotopes and Methylation and Methylmercury Compounds/*analysis and Soil/chemistry and Surface Properties",2012/09/18 06:00,10.1021/es204410x [doi],22536798,0213155,0 (Mercury Isotopes) and 0 (Methylmercury Compounds) and 0 (Soil),United States,NA,10.1021/es204410x [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Upper stems (81-200 cm) displayed distinct δ(13) C-CH(4) enrichment (Melaleuca -44.6‰ and Casuarina -46.5‰, respectively). Coupled 3D-photogrammetry with novel 3D-stem measurements revealed distinct hotspots of CH(4) flux and isotopic fractionation on Melaleuca, which were likely due to bark anomalies in which preferential pathways of gas efflux were enhanced.

Prevailing ecological knowledge on forested streams suggests that their food webs are based on allochthonous carbon, driven by a constant supply of organic matter from adjacent vegetation and limited primary production due to low light conditions. Extreme climatic disturbances can disrupt these natural ecosystem dynamics by altering resource availability, which leads to changes in food web structure and functioning. Here, we quantify the response of stream food webs to two major hurricanes (Irma and María, Category 5 and 4, respectively) that struck Puerto Rico in September 2017. Within two tropical forested streams (first and second order), we collected ecosystem and food web data 6 months prior to the hurricanes and 2, 9, and 18 months afterward. We assessed the structural (e.g., canopy) and hydrological (e.g., discharge) characteristics of the ecosystem and monitored changes in basal resources (i.e., algae, biofilm, and leaf litter), consumers (e.g., aquatic invertebrates, riparian consumers), and applied Layman's community-wide metrics using the isotopic composition of (13) C and (15) N. Continuous stream discharge measurements indicated that the hurricanes did not cause an extreme hydrological event. However, the sixfold increase in canopy openness and associated changes in litter input appeared to trigger an increase in primary production. These food webs were primarily based on terrestrially derived carbon before the hurricanes, but most taxa (including Atya and Xiphocaris shrimp, the consumers with highest biomass) shifted their food source to autochthonous carbon within 2 months of the hurricanes. We also found evidence that the hurricanes dramatically altered the structure of the food web, resulting in shorter (i.e., smaller food-chain length), narrower (i.e., lower diversity of carbon sources) food webs, as well as increased trophic species packing. This study demonstrates how hurricane disturbance can alter stream food webs, changing the trophic base from allochthonous to autochthonous resources via changes in the physical environment (i.e., canopy defoliation). As hurricanes become more frequent and severe due to climate change, our findings greatly contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain forested stream trophic interactions amidst global change.",Animals and *Food Chain and Ecosystem and *Cyclonic Storms and Invertebrates/physiology and Carbon,2024/01/03 09:44,10.1002/ecy.4202 [doi],37926483,0043541,7440-44-0 (Carbon),United States,© 2023 The Authors.

To address this, we used stable isotope (C, N, and H) analyses of food sources and macroinvertebrates from 15 streams in New Brunswick (Canada) and assessed how different catchment conditions arising from the gradient in forest management intensity affect the contribution of autochthonous resources to these food webs. Aquatic primary production contributed substantially to the biomass of invertebrates in these headwater streams, especially for scrapers and collector-gatherers (25-75%). However, the contribution of algae to food webs decreased as forest management intensity (road density and associated sediments, water cations/carbon, and dissolved organic matter humification) increased, and as canopy openness decreased. This trend was probably due to an increase in the delivery of organic and inorganic terrestrial materials (dissolved and in suspension) in areas of greater harvesting intensity and road density, which resulted in more heterotrophic biofilms. Overall, results suggest that, despite the presence of riparian buffers, forest management can affect stream food web structure via changes in energy flows, and that increased protection should be directed at minimizing ground disturbance in areas with direct hydrological connection to streams and at reducing dissolved and particulate matter inputs from roads and stream crossings in catchments with high degrees of management activity.",Animals and Canada and Food Chain and *Forests and Invertebrates and *Rivers,2019/10/12 06:00,10.1002/eap.1889 [doi],30929306,9889808,NA,United States,© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America.,10.1002/eap.1889 [doi],algae and allochthony and benthic macroinvertebrate and forest harvesting and road and stable isotope analysis,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Results were analyzed using classical univariate statistical methods and recently proposed uni- and multivariate metrics of the realized trophic niche of species. The trophic niche metrics were highly sensitive to both types of chemicals, but exposure resulted in different response patterns according to the nature of the tested compound. Thiram clearly affected gastropod trophic niche leading to a change in the food resources used and resulting in trophic niche expansion (i.e., increase of diversity of used resources, especially dead animals) or trophic niche contraction (i.e., decrease of diversity of used resources) across time. Both gastropod taxa exposed to hydrocarbons showed a clear trophic niche expansion. Trophic niche metrics therefore provide a promising way of investigating non-lethal effects of exposure to organic chemicals on aquatic invertebrates, and subsequent disturbances in food webs.","Animals and Environmental Monitoring/*methods and *Food Chain and Lymnaea and Rivers/chemistry and Snails/physiology and *Stress, Physiological and Toxicity Tests/*methods and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity",2015/10/01 06:00,S0048-9697(14)00335-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.03.005 [doi],24691210,0330500,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",Netherlands,Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here we review our understanding of the bioenergetics and feeding dynamics of tunas on a global scale, with an emphasis on yellowfin, bigeye, skipjack, albacore, and Atlantic bluefin tunas. Food consumption balances bioenergetics expenditures for respiration, growth (including gonad production), specific dynamic action, egestion, and excretion. Tunas feed across the micronekton and some large zooplankton. Some tunas appear to time their life history to take advantage of ephemeral aggregations of crustacean, fish, and molluscan prey. Ontogenetic and spatial diet differences are substantial, and significant interdecadal changes in prey composition have been observed. Diet shifts from larger to smaller prey taxa highlight ecosystem-wide changes in prey availability and diversity and provide implications for changing bioenergetics requirements into the future. Where tunas overlap, we show evidence of niche separation between them; resources are divided largely by differences in diet percentages and size ranges of prey taxa. The lack of long-term data limits the ability to predict impacts of climate change on tuna feeding behaviour. We note the need for systematic collection of feeding data as part of routine monitoring of these species, and we highlight the advantages of using biochemical techniques for broad-scale analyses of trophic relations. We support the continued development of ecosystem models, which all too often lack the regional-specific trophic data needed to adequately investigate climate and fishing impacts.","Animals and Diet/*veterinary and Eating and *Ecology and *Energy Metabolism/physiology and Feeding Behavior and Fisheries/economics and Models, Biological and Oceans and Seas and Reproduction/physiology and Tuna/metabolism/*physiology",2016/12/24 06:00,S0065-2881(16)30004-9 [pii] and 10.1016/bs.amb.2016.06.002 [doi],27573052,0370431,NA,United States,© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the switches of substrate spectrum and bacterial community upon oxygen perturbation in a nitrate-amended anaerobic toluene-degrading microbiota which was dominated by Aromatoleum species. DNA-stable isotope probing demonstrated that Aromatoleum species was involved in anaerobic mineralization of toluene.

Trophic structure analysis showed that the higher biomagnification rate in the Iténez River could not be attributed to a longer food chain. Nevertheless, it revealed for the Iténez River a higher contribution of periphyton to the diet of the primary consumers fish species; and more negative δ(13)C values for primary trophic sources, invertebrates and fishes that could indicate a higher contribution of methanotrophic bacteria. These two factors may enhance methylation and methyl mercury transfer in the food web and thus, alternatively or complementarily to the impact of the anthropogenic activities, may explain mercury differences observed in fishes from the Iténez River in comparison to the two other rivers.","Animals and Bolivia and *Fishes and Food Chain and Fresh Water/analysis/chemistry and Geography and Invertebrates and Mercury/analysis/*chemistry/toxicity and Methylmercury Compounds/analysis/chemistry/toxicity and Rivers/*chemistry and Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/chemistry",2014/01/11 06:00,PONE-D-13-03293 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0065054 [doi],23741452,101285081,"0 (Methylmercury Compounds) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0065054 [doi] and e65054,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC3669100,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Differences in feeding ecology may correlate with ontogenetic shifts in dispersal patterns, and therefore affect foraging habitat and resource utilization. Such life-history traits have important implications in interpreting tropho-dynamic linkages. Stable isotope ratios in the whiskers of sub-yearling southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina; n = 12) were used, in conjunction with satellite telemetry and environmental data, to examine their foraging habitat and diet during their first foraging migration. The trophic position of seals from Macquarie Island (54°30'S, 158°57'E) was estimated using stable carbon (δ(1) (3)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) ratios along the length of the whisker, which provided a temporal record of prey intake. Satellite-relayed data loggers provided details on seal movement patterns, which were related to isotopic concentrations along the whisker. Animals fed in waters south of the Polar Front (>60°S) or within Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Statistical Subareas 88.1 and 88.2, as indicated by both their depleted δ(1) (3)C (<-20‰) values, and tracking data. They predominantly exploited varying proportions of mesopelagic fish and squid, and crustaceans, such as euphausiids, which have not been reported as a prey item for this species. Comparison of isotopic data between sub-yearlings, and 1, 2 and 3 yr olds indicated that sub-yearlings, limited by their size, dive capabilities and prey capture skills to feeding higher in the water column, fed at a lower trophic level than older seals. This is consistent with the consumption of euphausiids and most probably, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), which constitute an abundant, easily accessible source of prey in water masses used by this age class of seals. Isotopic assessment and concurrent tracking of seals are successfully used here to identify ontogenetic shifts in broad-scale foraging habitat use and diet preferences in a highly migratory predator.","Animals and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Diet and Ecosystem and Environment and *Euphausiacea/physiology and *Feeding Behavior and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and *Predatory Behavior and Seals, Earless/growth & development/*physiology",2015/01/30 06:00,PONE-D-12-13075 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0086452 [doi],24516515,101285081,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0086452 [doi] and e86452,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC3905967,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We combined information about pre- and postdreissenid abundance, biomass, and secondary production of the littoral benthos with results of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of archival (predreissenid) and recent (postdreissenid) samples of all common benthic taxa. This approach enabled us to determine the importance of benthic and sestonic carbon to the littoral food web before, and more than a decade after dreissenid establishment. Long term dreissenid presence was associated with a 32-fold increase in abundance, 6-fold increase in biomass, and 14-fold increase in secondary production of the littoral benthos. Dreissenids comprised a large portion of the post-invasion benthos, making up 13, 38, and 56% of total abundance, biomass, and secondary production, respectively. The predreissenid food web was supported primarily by benthic primary production, while sestonic material was relatively more important to the postdreissenid food web. The absolute importance of both sestonic material and benthic primary production to the littoral benthos increased considerably following dreissenid establishment. Our results show drastic alterations to food web structure and suggest that dreissenid mussels redirect energy and material from the water column to the littoral benthos both through biodeposition of sestonic material as well as stimulation of benthic primary production.","Animals and Aquatic Organisms/*metabolism and Biomass and Bivalvia/*metabolism and *Energy Metabolism and *Food Chain and *Introduced Species and Isotopes/chemistry/metabolism and *Lakes and Models, Statistical",2013/06/19 06:00,PONE-D-12-00457 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0051249 [doi],23284673,101285081,0 (Isotopes),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0051249 [doi] and e51249,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC3524176,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Particularly in great apes, researchers can sample long hair completely non-invasively from nests, allowing the investigation of inter- and intra-individual dietary variation. Given its incremental growth pattern, hair records temporal shifts in diet over long periods and allows one to reconstruct seasonal dietary patterns in species that cannot be directly observed. However, as for other sample materials, there are potential drawbacks related to the properties of hair keratin. Here I review some important facts on the nature of primate hair and also introduce new isotopic data from infant bonobo hair to provide methodological recommendations for future sample collection in the field and sample preparation in the laboratory. While these methodological guidelines focus on great apes which can be sampled strictly non-invasively, I also consider applications to other free-ranging primates. The biochemical composition, growth cycle, isotope turnover rate and isotopic fractionation in hair keratin are particularly relevant for data analysis and interpretation. Also, one can microscopically identify infant hairs and analyze them separately to study nursing and weaning behavior in primates. The goal of this article is to encourage primatologists to analyze the stable isotope ratios of hair to assess primate feeding ecology. Am. J.

We coupled a stable isotope approach with a contaminant analysis of six metals (Pb, Ag, Zn, Hg, Cu, As) to trace the accumulation and dilution of metals from an abandoned mine across trophic levels of the benthic community in Ginzan Creek, Japan. The delta15N signature increased with trophic level, with mean increases of 4.70 per thousand from producers to primary consumers and 3.06 per thousand from primary to secondary consumers. Tissue Pb and Ag concentrations were negatively correlated with delta15N, indicating biodilution of both metals through the food web. Although macroinvertebrate taxon body mass was negatively correlated with tissue metal concentration at several sites, it did not increase with trophic level (as delta15N) in any of the sites, suggesting that changes in body mass were not the cause of biodilution. Our findings suggest invertebrates at higher trophic levels may exhibit increasingly efficient excretion of metals. Autotrophic epilithon (mean delta13C= -21.3 per thousand) had a much higher concentration of mined metals than did riparian vegetation (mean delta13C= -29.3 per thousand); nonetheless, a carbon-mixing model indicated that taxa feeding on autochthonous carbon sources did not accumulate more metal than allochthonous feeders. It is likely that the notably high metal concentration of allochthonous FPOM plays an important role in the trophic transfer of metals. Our data suggest the strong potential for stable isotope analysis to enhance our understanding of metal transfer through stream macroinvertebrate food webs.","Animals and Arsenic/analysis/*metabolism and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Environmental Monitoring/methods and *Food Chain and Industrial Waste and Invertebrates/*metabolism and Metals, Heavy/analysis/*metabolism and Mining and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Rivers/chemistry and Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/*metabolism",2008/08/30 09:00,S0048-9697(08)00010-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.01.006 [doi],18280545,0330500,"0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Industrial Waste) and 0 (Metals, Heavy) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and N712M78A8G (Arsenic)",Netherlands,NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.01.006 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,BBS/B/04358/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was used as a fungicide from 1945, leaving behind many contaminated sites. Very few studies have examined the biodegradation of HCB or the fate of HCB-derived carbon. Here we report that certain bacterial populations are capable of deriving carbon from HCB in contaminated soil under aerobic conditions. These populations are primarily Proteobacteria, including Methylobacterium and Pseudomonas, which predominated as detected by stable isotope probing (SIP) and 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing. Due to the nature of SIP, which can be used as a functional method solely for assimilatory processes, it is not possible to elucidate whether these populations metabolized directly HCB or intermediates of its metabolism produced by different populations. The possibility exists that HCB is degraded via the formation of pentachlorophenol (PCP), which is further mineralized. With this in mind, we designed primers to amplify PCP 4-monooxygenase-coding sequences based on the available pcpB gene sequence from Methylobacterium radiotolerans JCM 2831. Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis, organisms closely related to this strain were detected in (13)C-labeled DNA. Using the designed primers, we were able to amplify pcpB genes in both total community DNA and (13)C-DNA. This indicates that HCB might be transformed into PCP before it gets assimilated. In summary, this study is the first report on which bacterial populations benefit from carbon originating in the pesticide HCB in a contaminated soil.","Biodegradation, Environmental and Carbon Isotopes/metabolism and Czech Republic and DNA Primers and Hexachlorobenzene/chemistry/*metabolism and Isotope Labeling and Methylobacterium/*metabolism and Mixed Function Oxygenases/metabolism and Molecular Structure and Pentachlorophenol/chemistry/metabolism and Pseudomonas/*metabolism and RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction and Sequence Analysis, DNA and *Soil Microbiology and Soil Pollutants/*metabolism",2014/10/16 06:00,S0045-6535(14)00635-3 [pii] and 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.04.110 [doi],25065801,0320657,"0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (DNA Primers) and 0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S) and 0 (Soil Pollutants) and 4Z87H0LKUY (Hexachlorobenzene) and D9BSU0SE4T (Pentachlorophenol) and EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases) and EC 1.14.13.50 (pentachlorophenol monooxygenase)",England,Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

POP levels were low in all species in comparison to other locations worldwide, revealing a low impact of anthropogenic organic contaminants in the WIO. A predominance of OCPs (especially DDTs) versus PCBs was highlighted in all species; PFASs were predominant over chlorinated POPs in tunas. Among the studied PFASs, long-chain PFCAs were found to prevail over PFOS in all species. Organic contaminant profiles differed across species according to their foraging habitat; swordfish and bigeye tuna, which both feed in deep oceanic layers, showed similarities in their contaminant profiles. Geographically, the distinct DDT profiles of fish from the Mozambique Channel suggested an exposure to different DDT sources, in line with regional use of this insecticide and coupled with an extended residence time of fish in the Channel. To our knowledge, the data presented here are among the first obtained for legacy and emerging organic contaminants in various species of large pelagic predators from the WIO.","Animals and Environmental Monitoring and Fishes and Humans and Indian Ocean and *Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis and Seafood and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2020/11/21 06:00,S0013-9351(20)30654-X [pii] and 10.1016/j.envres.2020.109761 [doi],32562947,0147621,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and DFC2HB4I0K (Polychlorinated Biphenyls)",Netherlands,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Trophic magnification factors (TMFs) for these chemicals were calculated with values ranging from 1.0 to 3.1. TMFs for CP, mirex, anti-DP, and ∑DP were statistically greater than 1, showing evidence of biomagnification in the food web. Concentration ratios of anti-Cl(11)-DP to anti-DP showed a significant relationship with trophic level, implying that anti-Cl(11)-DP had a higher food-web magnification potential than its precursor.

Internal tree N cycling capacities are crucial to ensuring tree survival but how the N metabolism of forest trees responds to intense, repeated environmental stress is not well known. For 2 years, we submitted 9-year-old beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) trees to either a moderate or a severe prolonged drought or a yearly removal of 75% of the foliage to induce internal N cycling changes. During the second year of stress, in spring and summer, we sprayed 15N-urea on the leaves (one branch per tree). Then, for 14 days, we traced the 15N dynamics through the leaves, into foliar proteins and into the branch compartments (leaves and stems segments), as well as its long-distance transfer from the labeled branches to the tree apical twigs. Defoliation caused a short- and mid-term N increase in the leaves, which remained the main sink for N. Whatever the treatment and the date, most of the leaf 15N stayed in the leaves and was invested in soluble proteins (60-68% of total leaf N). 15N stayed more in the proximal part of the branch in response to drought compared with other treatments. The long-distance transport of N was maintained even under harsh drought, highlighting efficient internal N recycling in beech trees. Under extreme constraints creating an N and water imbalance, compensation mechanisms operated at the branch level in beech trees and allowed them (i) to maintain leaf N metabolism and protein synthesis and (ii) to ensure the seasonal short- and long-distance transfer of recycled leaf N even under drastic water shortage conditions.",*Droughts and Fagus/growth & development/*physiology and Food Chain and France and Nitrogen/*metabolism and Plant Leaves/*growth & development,2019/12/18 06:00,5321207 [pii] and 10.1093/treephys/tpz002 [doi],30770714,100955338,N762921K75 (Nitrogen),Canada,"© The Author(s) 2019.

We examined 109-year trends in total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in glaucous-winged gull feathers (1887-1996) from the Salish Sea. Adult flank feathers had higher MeHg concentrations than immature feathers, and males head feathers had higher THg concentrations than females. Overall, we found no evidence of a trend in feather MeHg or THg concentrations over time from 1887 to 1996. In the same individuals, δ(15)N, δ(13)C, and δ(34)S declined over time in gull feathers. In comparison, egg THg concentrations declined from 1970 to 2019 in two species of cormorants, likely reflecting decreases in local Hg sources. We conclude that diet shifts through time may have countered increased Hg deposition from long-range transport in glaucous-winged gulls.

Amphibians play a critical role both as consumers and prey in aquatic communities and yet there is still little information on the trophic status of most amphibians. More importantly, little is known about the extent to which they can alter their trophic ecology in response to changing conditions. We experimentally investigated the effects of increased amphibian density, presence of intraguild competitors, and presence of native and invasive predators (either free or caged) on the trophic status of a Mediterranean amphibian guild, using stable isotopes. We observed variations in δ13C and δ15N isotopic values among amphibian species and treatments and differences in their food sources. Macrophytes were the most important food resource for spadefoot toad tadpoles (Pelobates cultripes) and relatively important for all anurans within the guild. High density and presence of P. cultripes tadpoles markedly reduced macrophyte biomass, forcing tadpoles to increase their feeding on detritus, algae and zooplankton, resulting in lower δ13C values. Native dytiscid predators only changed the isotopic signature of newts whereas invasive red swamp crayfish had an enormous impact on environmental conditions and greatly affected the isotopic values of amphibians. Crayfish forced tadpoles to increase detritus ingestion or other resources depleted in δ13C. We found that the opportunistic amphibian feeding was greatly conditioned by intra- and interspecific competition whereas non-consumptive predator effects were negligible.

Yet, interrelationships between water availability and plant use on short timescales are difficult to quantify and remain poorly understood. To overcome previous methodological limitations, we coupled high-resolution in situ observations of stable isotopes in soil and transpiration water. We applied the approach along with Bayesian mixing modeling to track the fate of (2) H-labeled rain pulses following drought through soil and plants of deciduous tree ecosystems. We resolve how rainwater infiltrates the root zones in a nonequilibrium process and show that tree species differ in their ability to quickly acquire the newly available source. Sessile oak (Quercus petraea) adjusted root uptake to vertical water availability patterns under drought, but readjustment toward the rewetted topsoil was delayed. By contrast, European beech (Fagus sylvatica) readily utilized water from all soil depths independent of water depletion, enabling faster uptake of rainwater.

However, little is known on the effects of allochthonous subsidies on food web structure and trophic niche dimensions of consumers in the tropics. We excluded allochthonous aquatic insects from tropical streams using greenhouse-type exclosures to test the influence of aquatic allochthonous subsidies on the trophic structure and niche dimensions of terrestrial predators using stable isotope methods. In exclosure treatments, abundance and biomass of terrestrial predators, and biomass of phytophages decreased and increased, respectively. Vegetation-living predators were more responsive to allochthonous inputs than those living on the ground. Overall, lower availability of allochthonous inputs did not affect community-wide metrics and niche width of predators. However, the niche width of some spider families had very low overlap between treatments, and others had wider isotopic niches in the control than in the exclusion treatment. Most of the C and N in predators living in control stretches came from aquatic subsidies, and those predators living in the exclusion treatments switched their diets to terrestrial sources, showing a preference of predators for allochthonous subsidies. Our results suggest that allochthonous subsidies are also relevant to tropical fauna living upon vegetation. Moreover, allochthonous resources may amplify the niche dimension of certain predators or considerably change the trophic niche of others.

Elevated Cd concentrations in moose (Alces americanus) kidney have been observed in the region and are a health care concern for consumers of traditional foods. This study examined the factors associated with, and potential renal effects from, the accumulation of cadmium, and interactions with other elements in four sympatric ungulate species. Mean renal Cd concentration was highest in moose (48.3mg/kg ww), followed by mountain caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) (13.9mg/kg ww) and mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) (5.78mg/kg ww). No local sources of Cd were evident and the elevated levels in moose are considered to be natural in origin. Conversely, total Hg concentration was significantly higher in mountain caribou kidney (0.21mg/kg ww) than in moose (0.011mg/kg ww). (134)Cs (t½=2.1 y) in mountain goat and Dall's sheep (Ovis dalli) muscle is evidence of deposition from the Fukushima reactor accident in 2011. (137)Cs (t½=30.2 y) in all four ungulates is primarily a remnant of the nuclear weapons tests of the 1960s. The levels of both nuclides are low and the risk to the animals and people consuming them is negligible. Stable isotope δ(15)N and δ(13)C signatures in muscle showed a separation between the mountain caribou, with a lichen-dominated diet, and moose, which browse shrubs and forbs. Isotope signatures for mountain goat and Dall's sheep showed generalist feeding patterns. Differences in elemental and radionuclide levels between species were attributed to relative levels of metal accumulation in the different food items in the diets of the respective species. Kidneys from each species showed minor histological changes in the proximal tubule and glomerulus, although glomerular changes were rare and all changes were rare in mountain goat kidney. Kidney function was not expected to be affected in any species.

We show that MeHg levels in biota increased significantly ( p < 0.01) with δ(13)C and δ(15)N at all sites, implying the importance of both microbially processed diets (with increased δ(13)C) and trophic level (with increased δ(15)N) at which organisms feed, on MeHg levels in forest floor biota. The trophic magnification slopes of MeHg (defined as the slope of log(10)MeHg vs δ(15)N) for these forest floor food webs (0.20-0.28) were not significantly different ( p > 0.05) from those observed for diverse temperate freshwater systems (0.24 ± 0.07; n = 78), demonstrating for the first time the nearly equivalent efficiencies with which MeHg moves up the food chain in these contrasting ecosystem types. Our results suggest that in situ production of MeHg within the forest floor and efficient biomagnification both elevate MeHg levels in carnivorous invertebrates in temperate forests, which can contribute to significant bioaccumulation of this neurotoxin in terrestrial apex predators.","Animals and Ecosystem and Fishes and Food Chain and Forests and *Mercury and *Methylmercury Compounds and *Water Pollutants, Chemical",2019/09/19 06:00,10.1021/acs.est.8b06053 [doi],30727732,0213155,"0 (Methylmercury Compounds) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",United States,NA,10.1021/acs.est.8b06053 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Values of the delta(15)N were used as an index of trophic position in four length groups and compared to actual stomach contents. The diet of C. gariepinus within the length range of 201-600 mm L(T) mainly consisted of the small barb Barbus paludinosus, aquatic insects, and mollusks. The proportion of fish prey in the diet was 60% by volume, irrespective of fish size. The differences in delta(15)N values of individuals within and between length classes were less than 3 per thousand, and were not significantly related to total length, showing the similarity in trophic niche of the different sizes, which corresponded to recorded stomach contents. Mercury concentrations were in the range of 0.002-0.154 mg kg(-1) ww, and had no significant relationship to total length. Hence, even large specimens of C. gariepinus have Hg values below the WHO threshold of 0.2 mg kg(-1) ww. The slope of the regression line between log [Hg] and delta(15)N was small, 0.06, indicating the absence of trophic shifts and biomagnification of Hg in larger specimens in our samples. The low Hg concentrations in C. gariepinus compared to the Hg concentrations in other piscivorous fish species in Lake Awassa, such as Barbus intermedius and B. paludinosus, may be due to its dependence on invertebrate preys at small size, diet switching towards low Hg prey fish at larger size, and growth biodilution owing to higher growth rate.","Animals and Body Size and Carbon Isotopes and Catfishes/anatomy & histology/*metabolism and Diet and Environmental Monitoring and Ethiopia and Food Chain and Fresh Water and Mercury/*metabolism and Nitrogen Isotopes and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*metabolism",2007/05/26 09:00,S0048-9697(07)00155-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2007.01.091 [doi],17321567,0330500,"0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",Netherlands,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Stable light isotope analysis provides a means of assessing their diet, but diet-to-tissue discrimination factors have yet to be established for the species. METHODS: Isotope ratio ((15) N/(14) N and (13) C/(12) C expressed as δ(15) N and δ(13) C) analyses of scutes, claws, and blood of farmed crocodiles of different sizes were compared with the isotope values of their lifelong diet, which comprises chickens from a single supplier. RESULTS: Systematic size dependence in the diet-to-tissue discrimination factors for scute collagen, scute keratin, and claw keratin is described in regression relationships against the snout to vent length. Fixed values are presented for erythrocytes and blood plasma because blood was not sampled from juveniles. CONCLUSIONS: The diet-to-tissue discrimination factors help assess the diet of wild crocodiles. The diet of crocodiles from Lake Flag Boshielo shows a clear ontogenic shift, as has been seen in other studies, and the results strongly indicate a dependence on the terrestrial food web rather than a fish diet.

We address this social-ecological need for Pacific salmon fisheries, which are economically valuable but intercept much of the annual pulse of nutrient subsidies that salmon provide to terrestrial and aquatic food webs. We used grizzly bears, vectors of salmon nutrients and animals with densities strongly coupled to salmon abundance, as surrogates for ""salmon ecosystem"" function. Combining salmon biomass and stock-recruitment data with stable isotope analysis, we assess potential tradeoffs between fishery yields and bear population densities for six sockeye salmon stocks in Bristol Bay, Alaska, and British Columbia (BC), Canada. For the coastal stocks, we find that both bear densities and fishery yields would increase substantially if ecosystem allocations of salmon increase from currently applied lower to upper goals and beyond. This aligning of benefits comes at a potential cost, however, with the possibility of forgoing harvests in low productivity years. In contrast, we detect acute tradeoffs between bear densities and fishery yields in interior stocks within the Fraser River, BC, where biomass from other salmon species is low. There, increasing salmon allocations to ecosystems would benefit threatened bear populations at the cost of reduced long-term yields. To resolve this conflict, we propose an EBFM goal that values fisheries and bears (and by extension, the ecosystem) equally. At such targets, ecosystem benefits are unexpectedly large compared with losses in fishery yields. To explore other management options, we generate tradeoff curves that provide stock-specific accounting of the expected loss to fishers and gain to bears as more salmon escape the fishery. Our approach, modified to suit multiple scenarios, provides a generalizable method to resolve conflicts over shared resources in other systems.","Alaska and Animals and British Columbia and Conservation of Natural Resources/*methods and Diet and *Ecosystem and *Fisheries and Humans and Models, Biological and Population and Reproduction and Rivers and Salmon/*physiology and *Ursidae",2012/08/08 06:00,PBIOLOGY-D-11-04119 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001303 [doi],22505845,101183755,NA,United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pbio.1001303 [doi] and e1001303,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC3323506,The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,PLoS Biol. 2012;10(4):e1001304.

In this study, we examined food web structure (using carbon and nitrogen isotopes, δ(13)C and δ(15)N) and mercury (Hg) bioaccumulation and biomagnification in a small recurring polynya ecosystem near Nasaruvaalik Island (Nunavut, Canada). Methyl Hg (MeHg) concentrations increased by more than 50-fold from copepods (Calanus hyperboreus) to Arctic terns (Sterna paradisaea), the abundant predators at this site. The biomagnification of MeHg through members of the food web - using the slope of log MeHg versus δ(15)N - was 0.157 from copepods (C. hyperboreus) to fish. This slope was higher (0.267) when seabird chicks were included in the analyses. Collectively, our results indicate that MeHg biomagnification is occurring in this small polynya and that its trophic transfer is at the lower end of the range of estimates from other Arctic marine ecosystems. In addition, we measured Hg concentrations in some poorly studied members of Arctic marine food webs [e.g. Arctic alligatorfish (Ulcina olrikii) and jellyfish, Medusozoa], and found that MeHg concentrations in jellyfish were lower than expected given their trophic position. Overall, these findings provide fundamental information about food web structure and mercury contamination in a small Arctic polynya, which will inform future research in such ecosystems and provide a baseline against which to assess changes over time resulting from environmental disturbance.","Animals and Arctic Regions and *Ecosystem and *Environmental Monitoring and Mercury/*metabolism and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*metabolism and Zooplankton/*metabolism",2015/06/06 06:00,S0048-9697(14)01117-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.07.087 [doi],25149682,0330500,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",Netherlands,Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the laboratory, Cd isotopes were applied to synthetic sediment and isotope concentrations were measured in sediment, overlying water and exposed asellids over a 10-day period. Isotope ratios measured in sediment and water were compared to ratios measured in asellids to determine whether Cd partitioning could predict metal bioaccumulation. Two different parameters which might affect Cd partitioning between the sediment and overlying water compartments were investigated: the chemical form in which Cd was added to systems, and the organic matter content of the sediment. To test the effect of chemical form on Cd partitioning, three isotopes of cadmium were individually applied to formulated sediment in varying combinations of 113Cd(NO3)2, 112Cd-humic acid (HA) 114CdSO4. The results demonstrated that chemical form did not influence partitioning, as the Cd isotope that was applied to sediment in the nitrate form exhibited similar partitioning between sediment and overlying water as the isotope that was applied in the sulfate or HA form. However, Cd isotope concentrations in overlying water were strongly related to the pattern of isotope accumulation in asellids suggesting that overlying water concentrations determined Cd bioaccumulation. In contrast, when the organic matter content of sediment was increased through the addition of Sphagnum peat moss, total Cd concentrations in overlying water and tissue were low, and there was no relationship between Cd-isotope concentrations in tissue and water. These results indicate that Cd accumulation occurred primarily from water, and factors that increase metal partitioning to sediment, such as increased sediment organic matter content, decrease Cd accumulation in asellids.

Introduction of wheat and barley as well as the addition of domesticated herbivores during the Late Neolithic (∼2600-1900 BC) led to restructuring of ancient Chinese subsistence strategies. This study documents a dietary shift from indigenous millets to the newly introduced cereals in northcentral China during the Bronze Age Eastern Zhou Dynasty (771-221 BC) based on stable isotope analysis of human and animal bone samples. Our results show that this change affected females to a greater degree than males. We find that consumption of the newly introduced cereals was associated with less consumption of animal products and a higher rate of skeletal stress markers among females. We hypothesized that the observed separation of dietary signatures between males and females marks the rise of male-biased inequality in early China. We test this hypothesis by comparing Eastern Zhou human skeletal data with those from Neolithic Yangshao archaeological contexts. We find no evidence of male-female inequality in early farming communities. The presence of male-biased inequality in Eastern Zhou society is supported by increased body height difference between the sexes as well as the greater wealth of male burials.","Agriculture/*history and Animals and Archaeology and Body Height and Bone and Bones/pathology and Burial and Carbon Isotopes and China and Crops, Agricultural and Diet/*history and Female and History, Ancient and Humans and Male and Radiometric Dating and Sex Characteristics and Socioeconomic Factors/*history and Stress, Physiological",2018/04/13 06:00,1611742114 [pii] and 201611742 [pii] and 10.1073/pnas.1611742114 [doi],28096406,7505876,0 (Carbon Isotopes),United States,NA,10.1073/pnas.1611742114 [doi],East Asia and Yangshao and bioarchaeology and paleo diet and stable isotopes,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,PMC5293112,The authors declare no conflict of interest.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In order to assess tope shark (Galeorhinus galeus) trophic ecology, stable isotope ratios and trace metal concentrations in muscle tissue were determined, according to size and gender, for 124 individuals caught within the Mid-Atlantic region. Data was complemented and analysed according to previous stomach content information and compared with studies performed in the North East Atlantic. Our results revealed that tope sharks fed at a low trophic level and within a more pelagic-based food web when compared with other North Atlantic regions. MixSIR application reflected its piscivorous diet and study area topography, oligotrophic waters and volcanic nature, suggesting the occurrence of a Mid-Atlantic tope shark population. Considering a non-anthropogenic volcanic source for observed metal contents, the results reflect bioaccumulation and suggest biomagnification processes for As and Hg.

There was evidence of growth dilution of cobalt, copper, manganese, molybdenum, thallium, and vanadium, and bioaccumulation of mercury, which could be explained by increases in algal (and consequently, lake and fish) productivity.

Endemic New Zealand dung beetles (Canthonini) are an anomaly, occurring at high abundance and low diversity on an island archipelago historically lacking terrestrial mammals, except bats, and instead dominated by birds. Have New Zealand's dung beetles evolved to specialise on bird dung or carrion, or have they become broad generalist feeders? We test dietary preferences by analysing nitrogen isotope ratios of wild dung beetles and by performing feeding behaviour observations of captive specimens. We also use nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes to determine if the dung beetle Saphobius edwardsi will consume marine-derived carrion. Nitrogen isotope ratios indicated trophic generalism in Saphobius dung beetles and this was supported by behavioural observations where a broad range of food resources were utilised. Alternative food resource use was further illustrated experimentally by nitrogen and carbon stable isotope signatures of S. edwardsi, where individuals provided with decomposed squid had δ(15)N and δ(13)C values that had shifted toward values associated with marine diet. Our findings suggest that, in the absence of native mammal dung resources, New Zealand dung beetles have evolved a generalist diet of dung and carrion. This may include marine-derived resources, as provided by the seabird colonies present in New Zealand forests before the arrival of humans. This has probably enabled New Zealand dung beetles to persist in indigenous ecosystems despite the decline of native birds and the introduction of many mammal species.","Analysis of Variance and Animals and *Biological Evolution and Birds/*physiology and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Coleoptera/*physiology and *Diet and *Ecosystem and Feces/chemistry and Feeding Behavior/physiology and Image Processing, Computer-Assisted and New Zealand and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Video Recording",2014/11/19 06:00,10.1007/s00442-014-3001-z [doi],24974270,0150372,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),Germany,NA,10.1007/s00442-014-3001-z [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mercury was significantly correlated with concentrations in all tissues (kidney, liver and muscle). Stable C and N isotopes in baleen were generally similar to those of muscle, which reflects the recent (approximately one month) feeding of the whale, but in some individuals there were significant differences between baleen and muscle.

This omnivorous configuration occurs frequently in food webs, but theory suggests that it is unstable unless stabilizing mechanisms exist that can decrease the strength of the omnivore and consumer interaction. Although these mechanisms have been documented in native food webs, little is known about whether they operate in the context of an introduced species. Here, we study a marine mussel aquaculture system where the introduction of omnivorous mussels should generate an unstable food web that favors the extinction of the consumer, yet it persists. Using field and laboratory approaches, we searched for stabilizing mechanisms that could reduce interaction strengths in the food web. While field zooplankton counts suggested that mussels influence the composition and abundance of copepods, stable isotope results indicated that life-history omnivory and cannibalism facilitated the availability of prey refugia, and reduced competition and the interaction strength between the mussel omnivore and zooplankton consumers. In laboratory experiments, however, we found no evidence of adaptive feeding which could weaken predator-consumer interactions. Our food web study suggests that the impact of an introduced omnivore may not only depend on its interaction with native species but also on the availability of stabilizing mechanisms that alter the strength of those interactions.",NA,2017/07/12 06:01,ECE32773 [pii] and 10.1002/ece3.2773 [doi],28690827,101566408,NA,England,NA,10.1002/ece3.2773 [doi],adaptive feeding and intraguild predation and invasive species and ontogenetic niche shift and prey size refugia and stage structure,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,PMC5496542,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Six observations sites located in Yamakiya Village (Kawamata Town; since 2014), Tsushima Village (Namie Town, since 2015), and Tomioka Town (since 2017) were monitored. The forests consisted of artificial plantations of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) at Yamakiya Village, Tsushima Village, and Tomioka Town. Tsushima Village also had a natural mixed forest dominated by Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora), and Tomioka Town had a young and a mature artificial plantation of Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtuse). Concentrations of (137)Cs were monitored in the samples collected from the main aboveground biomass compartments, fresh litterfall, forest litter, and soil. Concentrations of exchangeable forms of (137)Cs and stable K were measured in soil samples. During the observation period, the litter radiocesium inventories at all sites decreased significantly to approximately 1% or less of the total ground deposition. Approximately 80% of the total radiocesium inventory is localized in the upper 5-cm layer of soil and there is little downward migration of radiocesium. At the sites with the longest monitoring series (Yamakiya and Tsushima), the radiocesium expectation depths and expectation mass depths were relatively constant at 2-3 cm and 5-6 kg m(-2), respectively. Aboveground biomass compartments showed similar decreasing trends in radiocesium aggregated transfer factors, T(ag), in the compartments that were exposed to atmospheric fallout in March 2011 (old foliage, small branches, and outer bark). The mean T(ag) in cedar stand compartments currently are in the range of 10(-3)-10(-2) m(2) kg(-1) dw. However, the mean T(ag) and their dynamic trend significantly differed in the wood compartments of the cedar stands, which may indicate root uptake differences of orders of magnitude between observation sites. The difference in radiocesium concentration in wood between the sites becomes less pronounced when normalized by the ratio of exchangeable (137)Cs/K in the soils.","Cesium Radioisotopes/analysis and *Chamaecyparis and *Cryptomeria and Ecosystem and Forests and *Fukushima Nuclear Accident and Japan and *Pinus and *Radiation Monitoring and Soil and *Soil Pollutants, Radioactive/analysis",2022/09/02 06:00,S0265-931X(22)00138-2 [pii] and 10.1016/j.jenvrad.2022.106947 [doi],35732077,8508119,"0 (Cesium Radioisotopes) and 0 (Soil) and 0 (Soil Pollutants, Radioactive)",England,Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Stable isotopic ratios of carbon ((13)C/(12)C) and nitrogen ((15)N/(14)N) were determined as well to provide insights into diet variations between regions or through time. Mercury concentrations decreased the first years of life of the animals suggesting that Hg had been transferred from the mother to the foetus and newborn. The Hg concentrations in teeth were significantly lesser in ringed seals from central West Greenland compared to those from central East Greenland. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic values measured in the animals differed also significantly between the two regions. Increasing temporal trends of dental Hg concentrations between 1994 and 2006 were observed in ringed seals from both central West Greenland and central East Greenland. These increases were attributed to global changes in environmental Hg levels since no temporal trends in delta(15)N values were found to support the hypothesis of a diet shift over time. Furthermore, a decreasing temporal trend in delta(13)C values was observed in the teeth of seals from central East Greenland, and explained by a likely change over time towards more pelagic feeding habits; alternatively, the so-known Seuss effect was thought to be responsible for this decrease. Finally, it was concluded that the tooth of ringed seal was a good monitoring tissue to assess Hg trends.","Animals and Carbon Isotopes/metabolism and Environmental Monitoring/*methods and Female and Male and Mercury/*metabolism and Nitrogen Isotopes/metabolism and Phoca/*metabolism and Tooth/metabolism and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*metabolism and Water Pollution, Chemical/statistics & numerical data",2010/10/30 06:00,S0048-9697(10)00732-1 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.07.038 [doi],20696465,0330500,"0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",Netherlands,Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V.

As extant apes live in C(3)-dominated habitats, variation in isotope signatures is assumed to be low compared to hominoids exploiting C(4)-plant resources. However, isotopic differences between sites and between and within individuals are poorly understood due to the lack of vegetation baseline data. In this comparative study, we included all species of free-ranging African great apes (Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Gorilla sp.). First, we explore differences in isotope baselines across different habitats and whether isotopic signatures in apes can be related to feeding niches (faunivory and folivory). Secondly, we illustrate how stable isotopic variations within African ape populations compare to other extant and extinct primates and discuss possible implications for dietary flexibility. Using 701 carbon and nitrogen isotope data points resulting from 148 sectioned hair samples and an additional collection of 189 fruit samples, we compare six different great ape sites. We investigate the relationship between vegetation baselines and climatic variables, and subsequently correct great ape isotope data to a standardized plant baseline from the respective sites. We obtained temporal isotopic profiles of individual animals by sectioning hair along its growth trajectory. Isotopic signatures of great apes differed between sites, mainly as vegetation isotope baselines were correlated with site-specific climatic conditions. We show that controlling for plant isotopic characteristics at a given site is essential for faunal data interpretation. While accounting for plant baseline effects, we found distinct isotopic profiles for each great ape population. Based on evidence from habituated groups and sympatric great ape species, these differences could possibly be related to faunivory and folivory. Dietary flexibility in apes varied, but temporal variation was overall lower than in fossil hominins and extant baboons, shifting from C(3) to C(4)-resources, providing new perspectives on comparisons between extinct and extant primates.",Animals and Carbon Isotopes/*analysis and *Diet and Ecology and Feeding Behavior and Fossils and Fruit/anatomy & histology and Gorilla gorilla/*physiology and Hair/*chemistry and Nitrogen Isotopes/*analysis and Pan paniscus/*physiology and Pan troglodytes/*physiology and Papio and Plants,2017/09/08 06:00,S0047-2484(16)30130-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.jhevol.2016.08.007 [doi],27886808,0337330,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),England,Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Dietary reconstructions inferred from stable isotopes of fossil herbivorous mammalian tooth enamel document environmental and climatic changes in ancient ecosystems, including C(3)/C(4) transitions and relative seasonality. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we use stable carbon and oxygen isotopes preserved in fossil teeth to document the magnitude of mammalian dietary shifts and ancient floral change during geologically documented glacial and interglacial periods during the Pliocene (approximately 1.9 million years ago) and Pleistocene (approximately 1.3 million years ago) in Florida. Stable isotope data demonstrate increased aridity, increased C(4) grass consumption, inter-faunal dietary partitioning, increased isotopic niche breadth of mixed feeders, niche partitioning of phylogenetically similar taxa, and differences in relative seasonality with warming. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data show that global warming resulted in dramatic vegetation and dietary changes even at lower latitudes (approximately 28 degrees N). Our results also question the use of models that predict the long term decline and extinction of species based on the assumption that niches are conserved over time.

We determined isotope ratios (IRs) of Hg in food webs (zooplankton, chironomids, Arctic char) and sediments of 10 Arctic lakes from four regions and investigated the extent of Hg isotope fractionation. Hg IRs were analyzed by multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP/MS). Hg mass independent fractionation (MIF; Delta(199)Hg) and mass dependent fractionation (MDF; delta(202)Hg) were calculated and compared among samples. IRs of Hg in sediment were characterized mainly by MDF and low MIF (Delta(199)Hg -0.37 to 0.74 per thousand). However, all biota showed evidence of MIF, most pronounced in zooplankton (Delta(199)Hg up to 3.40 per thousand) and char (Delta(199)Hg up to 4.87 per thousand). Zooplankton takes up highly fractionated MeHg directly from the water column, while benthic organisms are exposed to sedimentary Hg, which contains less fractionated Hg. As evidenced by delta(13)C measurements, benthic chironomids make up a large proportion of char diet, explaining in part why MIF(char) < MIF(zooplankton) in lakes, where both samples were measured. Hg IRs in char varied among regions, while char from lakes from each region showed similar degrees of MIF. A MIF-offset was derived representing the mean MIF difference between sediment and fish, and indicated that fish in two regions retain sediment signatures altered by a consistent offset. Due to its minimal lake-to-catchment area and very high water retention time ( approximately 330 years), the meteor impact crater lake (Pingualuk) reflects a ""pure"" atmospheric Hg signature, which is modified only by aqueous in-lake processes. All other lakes are also affected by terrestrial Hg inputs and sediment processes.","Animals and Arctic Regions and Chemical Fractionation/*methods and Environmental Monitoring/methods and *Food Chain and Fresh Water/*analysis and Geologic Sediments/chemistry and Isotopes/*chemistry and Mercury/*analysis and Trout and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*analysis and Zooplankton/chemistry",2010/02/26 06:00,10.1021/es901771r [doi],20000504,0213155,"0 (Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",United States,NA,10.1021/es901771r [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Variation in fish Hg burden between lakes is often high and may result from differences in Hg transfer through lower levels of the food web where mercury is bioconcentrated to phytoplankton and transferred to herbivorous zooplankton. Prior research derived patterns of mercury accumulation in freshwater invertebrates from field collected animals. This study provides results from controlled mesocosm experiments comparing the effects of zooplankton composition, algal abundance, and the chemical speciation of mercury on the ability of zooplankton to accumulate mercury from phytoplankton and transfer that mercury to planktivores. Experiments were conducted in 550-L mesocosms across a gradient of algal densities manipulated by inorganic nutrient additions. Enriched, stable isotopes of organic (CH3(200HgCl)) and inorganic (201HgCl2) mercury were added to mesocosms and their concentrations measured in water, seston, and three common zooplankton species. After 2 weeks, monomethylmercury (MMHg) concentrations were two to three times lower in the two copepod species, Leptodiaptomus minutus and Mesocyclops edax than in the cladoceran, Daphnia mendotae. All three zooplankton species had higher MMHg concentrations in mesocosms with low versus high initial algal abundance. However, despite higher concentrations of inorganic mercury (HgI) in seston from low nutrient mesocosms, there were no significant differences in the HgI accumulated by zooplankton across nutrient treatments. Bioaccumulation factors for MMHg in the plankton were similar to those calculated for plankton in natural lakes and a four-compartment (aqueous, seston, macrozooplankton, and periphyton/sediments) mass balance model after 21 days accounted for approximately 18% of the CH3(200Hg) and approximately 33% of the 201Hg added. Results from our experiments corroborate results from field studies and suggest the importance of particular zooplankton herbivores (e.g., Daphnia) in the transfer of Hg to higher trophic levels in aquatic food webs.","Animals and Copepoda/classification/metabolism and Eukaryota/*metabolism and *Food Chain and Fresh Water and Humans and Iodides/metabolism and Isotopes and Mercury/*metabolism and Methylmercury Compounds/metabolism and Nutritional Physiological Phenomena and Phosphorus/metabolism and Species Specificity and Time Factors and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*metabolism and Zooplankton/*metabolism",2005/05/10 09:00,S0048-9697(04)00572-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2004.07.025 [doi],15740761,0330500,"0 (Iodides) and 0 (Isotopes) and 0 (Methylmercury Compounds) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and 27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",Netherlands,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,P42 ES007373/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States and ES07373-06/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States and ES07373-07/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We used the large-scale experimental framework of four marine reserves, spanning an oceanographic gradient in northeastern New Zealand, to test the extent to which the exploitation of reef predators can alter kelp carbon flux and secondary production. We provide evidence that the reduction of predatory snapper (Pagrus auratus) and lobster (Jasus edwardsii) can lead to an increase in sea urchins (Evechinus chloroticus) and indirect declines in kelp biomass in some locations but not others. Stable carbon isotope ratios (delta13C) of oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and mussels (Perna canaliculus) transplanted in reserve and fished sites within four locations revealed that fishing indirectly reduced the proportion of kelp-derived organic carbon assimilated by filter feeders in two locations where densities of actively grazing sea urchins were 23.7 and 8.3 times higher and kelp biomass was an order of magnitude lower than in non-fished reserve sites. In contrast, in the two locations where fishing had no effect on urchin density or kelp biomass, we detected no effect of fishing on the carbon signature of filter feeders. We show that the effects of fishing on nearshore trophic structure and carbon flux are context-dependent and hinge on large-scale, regional oceanographic factors. Where cascading effects of fishing on kelp biomass were documented, enhanced assimilation of kelp carbon did not result in the magnification of secondary production. Instead, a strong regional gradient in filter feeder growth emerged, best predicted by chlorophyll a. Estimates of kelp contribution to the diet of transplanted consumers averaged 56.9% +/- 6.2% (mean +/- SE) for mussels and 33.8% +/- 7.3% for oysters, suggesting that organic carbon fixed by kelp is an important food source fueling northeastern New Zealand's nearshore food webs. The importance of predators in mediating benthic primary production and organic carbon flux suggests that overfishing can have profound consequences on ecosystem functioning particularly where pelagic primary production is limiting.

Greater spread among species along the carbon axis suggests that the primary consumers exploit organic matter with various origins, whereas different nitrogen signals of the secondary consumers suggest that they feed on different suites of prey.

Increased photosynthetic activity is expected, especially for C-3 plants, thereby influencing vegetation dynamics; however, little is known about the path of fixed carbon into soil-borne communities and resulting feedbacks on ecosystem function. Here, we examine how arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) act as a major conduit in the transfer of carbon between plants and soil and how elevated atmospheric CO(2) modulates the belowground translocation pathway of plant-fixed carbon. Shifts in active AMF species under elevated atmospheric CO(2) conditions are coupled to changes within active rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities. Thus, as opposed to simply increasing the activity of soil-borne microbes through enhanced rhizodeposition, elevated atmospheric CO(2) clearly evokes the emergence of distinct opportunistic plant-associated microbial communities. Analyses involving RNA-based stable isotope probing, neutral/phosphate lipid fatty acids stable isotope probing, community fingerprinting, and real-time PCR allowed us to trace plant-fixed carbon to the affected soil-borne microorganisms. Based on our data, we present a conceptual model in which plant-assimilated carbon is rapidly transferred to AMF, followed by a slower release from AMF to the bacterial and fungal populations well-adapted to the prevailing (myco-)rhizosphere conditions. This model provides a general framework for reappraising carbon-flow paths in soils, facilitating predictions of future interactions between rising atmospheric CO(2) concentrations and terrestrial ecosystems.","Atmosphere/chemistry and Bacteria/genetics/metabolism and Carbon/*metabolism and Carbon Dioxide/*metabolism and Carbon Isotopes/metabolism and Carex Plant/metabolism/microbiology and Climate Change and *Ecosystem and Festuca/metabolism/microbiology and Fungi/genetics/metabolism and Models, Biological and Molecular Sequence Data and Mycorrhizae/metabolism and Plant Roots/*metabolism/*microbiology and RNA, Bacterial/genetics and RNA, Fungal/genetics and Soil/analysis and Soil Microbiology",2010/07/16 06:00,0912421107 [pii] and 200912421 [pii] and 10.1073/pnas.0912421107 [doi],20534474,7505876,"0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (RNA, Bacterial) and 0 (RNA, Fungal) and 0 (Soil) and 142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide) and 7440-44-0 (Carbon)",United States,NA,10.1073/pnas.0912421107 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC2890735,The authors declare no conflict of interest.,NA,GENBANK/GU123663 and GENBANK/GU123664 and GENBANK/GU123665 and GENBANK/GU123666 and GENBANK/GU123667 and GENBANK/GU123668 and GENBANK/GU123669 and GENBANK/GU123670 and GENBANK/GU123671 and GENBANK/GU123672 and GENBANK/GU123673 and GENBANK/GU123674 and GENBANK/GU123675 and GENBANK/GU123676 and GENBANK/GU123677 and GENBANK/GU123678 and GENBANK/GU123679 and GENBANK/GU123680 and GENBANK/GU123681 and GENBANK/GU123682 and GENBANK/GU123683 and GENBANK/GU123684 and GENBANK/GU123685 and GENBANK/GU123686 and GENBANK/GU123687 and GENBANK/GU123688,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding whether or not changes in dietary food composition accompanied the shift in food production away from foraging. In order to reveal the impact of the development of agriculture on the human diet over the Pre-Pottery and Pottery Neolithic periods in this region, we analyzed the isotopic compositions of amino acids from the farmers at the Hakemi Use Pottery Neolithic site, and compared them with those from the Pre-Pottery hunter-gatherers in the close region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herein, we report the nitrogen isotopic compositions of amino acids, as well as both carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of bulk collagen, from human and faunal remains collected from Hakemi Use. RESULTS: Whereas freshwater resources were consumed by hunter-gatherers in this region during the Pre-Pottery period, the δ(15) N values of glutamic acid (δ(15) N(Glu) ) and phenylalanine (δ(15) N(Phe) ) suggest that freshwater food resources were rarely consumed by inhabitants following the development of agriculture. DISCUSSION: Despite living in similar settings by the Tigris as its inhabitants during the Pre-Pottery period, the farmers of the Pottery Neolithic period depended less on freshwater resources for their diets relative to the hunter-gatherers of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period.","Amino Acids/*chemistry and Animals and Archaeology and Bone and Bones/chemistry and Burial and Cattle and Collagen/analysis/chemistry and Diet/*history and Dogs and Farmers/history and Female and *Fresh Water and Goats and History, Ancient and Humans and Male and Nitrogen Isotopes/*analysis and Sheep and Turkey",2020/01/10 06:00,10.1002/ajpa.23783 [doi],30693483,0400654,0 (Amino Acids) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 9007-34-5 (Collagen),United States,"© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/ajpa.23783 [doi],Anatolia and Neolithic period and amino acid and paleodiet and stable isotopes,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,"21320145/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, and the and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/International and 24251013/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, and the and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/International and 15H05969/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, and the and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/International and 16H06684/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, and the and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/International and 18K12562/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, and the and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/International and 18H00754/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, and the and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/International and Bilateral Joint Research Projects/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and and Technology, and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Higher concentrations of PCBs occurred in decapods and fish than in mollusks. In contrast, concentrations of PAHs and alkylphenols were lower in decapods and fish than in mollusks. Unlike PCBs, whose concentrations largely increased with increasing delta(15)N (i.e. increasing trophic level), all PAHs and alkylphenols analyzed followed a reverse trend. Molecular weights of PAHs are lower than those of PCBs, therefore low membrane permeability caused by large molecular size is an unlikely factor in the ""biodilution"" of PAHs.

The arctic fox population in Iceland has increased steadily over a period of 30 years, an increase that has been attributed to an overall increase in food abundance. We hypothesized that increasing populations of geese or seabirds were driving this growth. We analyzed stable isotopes in a long-term series of collagen samples to determine the role of these different resources. The isotopic signatures of arctic foxes differed consistently between coastal and inland habitats. While δ(15)N displayed a non-linear change over time with a slight increase in the first part of the period followed by a decline in both habitats, δ(13)C was stable. Stable isotope mixing models suggested that marine resources and rock ptarmigan were the most important dietary sources, with marine resources dominating in coastal habitats and rock ptarmigan being more important inland. Our results suggest that seabirds may have been driving the arctic fox population increase. The rapidly increasing populations of breeding geese seem to have played a minor role in arctic fox population growth, as rock ptarmigan was the most important terrestrial resource despite a considerable decrease in their abundance during recent decades. This study shows that a long-term population trend in a generalist predator may have occurred without a pronounced change in main dietary resources, despite ongoing structural changes in the food web, where one species of herbivorous birds increased and another decreased.",Animals and Arctic Regions and *Ecosystem and *Foxes and Iceland and Isotopes and Predatory Behavior,2020/02/08 06:00,10.1007/s00442-019-04580-0 [pii] and 10.1007/s00442-019-04580-0 [doi],31865484,0150372,0 (Isotopes),Germany,NA,10.1007/s00442-019-04580-0 [doi],Diet and Iceland and Population increase and Stable isotope analysis and Vulpes lagopus,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Two main trophic strategies for resource acquisition have been described: competition and opportunism. In the present study our objective was to identify the main trophic strategies of the non-native amphibian Discoglossus pictus and its potential trophic impact on the native amphibian Bufo calamita. We determine whether D. pictus exploits similar trophic resources to those exploited by the native B. calamita (competition hypothesis) or alternative resources (opportunistic hypothesis). To this end, we analyzed the stable isotope values of nitrogen and carbon in larvae of both species, in natural ponds and in controlled laboratory conditions. The similarity of the δ15N and δ13C values in the two species coupled with isotopic signal variation according to pond conditions and niche partitioning when they co-occurred indicated dietary competition. Additionally, the non-native species was located at higher levels of trophic niches than the native species and B. calamita suffered an increase in its standard ellipse area when it shared ponds with D. pictus. These results suggest niche displacement of B. calamita to non-preferred resources and greater competitive capacity of D. pictus in field conditions. Moreover, D. pictus showed a broader niche than the native species in all conditions, indicating increased capacity to exploit the diversity of resources; this may indirectly favor its invasiveness. Despite the limitations of this study (derived from potential variability in pond isotopic signals), the results support previous experimental studies. All the studies indicate that D. pictus competes with B. calamita for trophic resources with potential negative effects on the fitness of the latter.","Adaptation, Physiological and Animals and Anura/growth & development/*physiology and Bufonidae/growth & development/physiology and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and *Competitive Behavior and Diet and Ecosystem and *Feeding Behavior and *Introduced Species and Larva and Models, Biological and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Nutritional Status and *Ponds and Spain and Species Specificity",2016/04/20 06:00,PONE-D-14-49385 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0130549 [doi],26101880,101285081,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0130549 [doi] and e0130549,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC4478020,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

By using fossils from the well-dated Shungura Formation (lower Omo Valley, northern Turkana Basin, southern Ethiopia), we investigate palaeodietary changes in one bovid and in one suid lineage from 3 to 2 Ma using stable isotope analysis of tooth enamel. Results show unexpectedly large increases in C(4) dietary intake around 2.8 Ma in both the bovid and suid, and possibly in a previously reported hippopotamid species. Enamel δ(13)C values after 2.8 Ma in the bovid (Tragelaphus nakuae) are higher than recorded for any living tragelaphin, and are not expected given its conservative dental morphology. A shift towards increased C(4) feeding at 2.8 Ma in the suid (Kolpochoerus limnetes) appears similarly decoupled from a well-documented record of dental evolution indicating gradual and progressive dietary change. The fact that two, perhaps three, disparate Pliocene herbivore lineages exhibit similar, and contemporaneous changes in dietary behaviour suggests a common environmental driver. Local and regional pollen, palaeosol and faunal records indicate increased aridity but no corresponding large and rapid expansion of grasslands in the Turkana Basin at 2.8 Ma.

This detoxification ability may largely depend on how AM fungi influence the uptake and distribution of metals in host plants. Two experiments were performed in order to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying cadmium (Cd) tolerance in mycorrhizal plants. Stable isotope Cd(106) and compartmented pots were adopted to quantify the contribution of the AM fungus, Rhizophagus irregularis, to the uptake of Cd by Lotus japonicus. Moreover, synchrotron radiation μX-ray fluorescence (SR-μXRF) was applied to localize Cd in the mycorrhizal roots at the sub-cellular level. The results obtained indicated that mycorrhizal colonization markedly enhanced Cd immobilization in plant roots. Less Cd was partitioned to plant shoots when only hyphae had access to Cd in the hyphal compartment than when roots also had direct access to the Cd pool. SR-μXRF imaging indicated that Cd absorbed by extraradical hyphae was translocated into intraradical fungal structures, in which arbuscules accumulated large amounts of Cd; however, plant cells without fungal structures and plant cell walls contained negligible amounts of Cd. The present results provide direct evidence for the intraradical immobilization of Cd absorbed by AM fungi, which may largely contribute to the enhanced tolerance of plants to Cd.

This assessment is an important first step in quantifying food-web structure in a region subject to intense fishing activities. Nearshore food webs were driven by at least two isotopically distinct trophic pathways, algal and seagrass, with a greater proportion of the sampled species feeding within the seagrass food web (57%) compared with the algal food web (33%). There was considerable isotopic niche overlap among species (92% of species overlapped with at least one other species). Narrow isotopic niche widths of most (83%) species sampled, low isotopic similarity (only 23% of species exhibited no differences in δ(13) C and δ(15) N) and low predicted trophic redundancy among fishes most commonly caught by fishermen (15%), however, suggest that adjustments to resource management concerning harvesting and gear selectivity may be needed for the persistence of artisanal fishing in northern Tanzania.

An understanding of how food webs and bioaccumulation dynamics respond to these challenges requires the quantification of energy flow. We present a combined, multitracer approach using both polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and stable isotopes to trace energy flow, and to quantify how lake trout feeding strategies have adapted to changes in food web structure in 3 basins of Lake Huron (ON, Canada). This combined tracer approach allows the quantification of dietary proportions (using stable isotopes), which are then integrated using a novel PCB tracer approach that employs knowledge of PCB bioaccumulation pathways, to estimate consumption and quantify energy flow between age cohorts of individual fish across Lake Huron. We observed basin-specific differences in ultimate energy sources for lake trout, with Georgian Bay lake trout deriving almost 70% of their energy from benthic resources compared with 16 and 33% for Main Basin and North Channel lake trout, respectively. These differences in resource utilization are further magnified when they are contrasted with age. The dependency on pelagic energy sources in the Main Basin and North Channel suggests that these populations will be the most negatively affected by the ongoing trophic collapse in Lake Huron. Our study demonstrates the utility of a multitracer approach to quantify the consequences of food web adaptations to changes in aquatic ecosystems.

We applied compound-specific stable isotope analyses of both carbon and nitrogen in amino acids from fish muscle tissue to quantify the proportional contributions of primary production sources and trophic positions of eight prey species (n = 474 total) that are part of Steller sea lion diets. Previous THg analyses of fish muscle, coupled with monomethylmercury analyses of a subset of samples, substantiated previous findings that fishes from the west of Amchitka Pass, a discrete oceanographic boundary of the Aleutian Archipelago, have higher muscle Hg concentrations relative to fishes from the east. The δ(13)C values of essential amino acids (EAAs) in fish muscle demonstrated that although most fishes obtained their EAAs primarily from algae, some species varied in the extent to which they relied on this EAA source. The δ(15)N values of phenylalanine (0.9 to 7.8 ‰), an indicator of the isotopic baseline of a food web, varied widely within and among fish species. Trophic position estimates, accounting for this baseline variation, were higher from the west relative to the east of the pass for some fish species. Trophic magnification slopes using baseline-corrected trophic position estimates indicated similar rates of Hg biomagnification to the east and west of Amchitka Pass. Multiple linear regression models revealed that trophic position was the most important driver of fish muscle [THg] with less variation explained by other parameters. Thus, higher trophic positions but not the rate of Hg biomagnification to the west of Amchitka Pass may play a role in the regional differences in both fish and Steller sea lion [THg]. Although, differences in Hg contamination and uptake at the base of the east and west food webs could not be excluded.","Animals and *Mercury/analysis and Alaska and Amino Acids/metabolism and *Sea Lions/metabolism and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis and Fishes/metabolism and Food Chain and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Environmental Monitoring",2023/11/27 12:42,S0048-9697(23)06869-9 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168242 [doi],37918743,0330500,"FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury) and 0 (Amino Acids) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes)",Netherlands,Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Food diets have been estimated by analysis of fish stomach content and food web stable isotopes (delta13C and delta15N). OCs with octanol--water partition coefficient (Kow) higher than 10(6) showed lower concentrations in food than expected from theoretical octanol--water partition, indicating thatthe distribution of these compounds does not reach equilibrium within the life span of the food web organisms (ca. 1 year).

Yet, the reestablishment of trophic interactions among organisms in restored habitats is equally important if we are to monitor and understand how ecosystems recover. This study examined whether food web interactions among arthropods (as inferred by abundance of naturally occurring stable isotopes of C [delta13C] and N [delta15N]) were reestablished in the restoration of a coastal Spartina alterniflora salt marsh that had been invaded by Phragmites australis. From patterns of C and N stable isotopes we infer that trophic interactions among arthropods in the native salt marsh habitats are characterized by reliance on the dominant marsh plant Spartina as a basal resource. Herbivores such as delphacid planthoppers and mirid bugs have isotope signatures characteristic of Spartina, and predatory arthropods such as dolicopodid flies and spiders likewise have delta13C and delta15N signatures typical of Spartina-derived resources (approximately -13 per thousand and 10 per thousand, respectively). Stable isotope patterns also suggest that the invasion of Phragmites into salt marshes and displacement of Spartina significantly alter arthropod food web interactions. Arthropods in Phragmites-dominated sites have delta13C isotope values between -18 per thousand and -20 per thousand, suggesting reliance on detritus and/or benthic microalgae as basal resources and not on Phragmites, which has a delta13C approximately -26 per thousand. Since most Phragmites herbivores are either feeding internally or are rare transients from nearby Spartina, these resources do not provide significant prey resources for other arthropod consumers. Rather, predator isotope signatures in the invaded habitats indicate dependence on detritus/algae as basal resources instead of the dominant vegetation. The reestablishment of Spartina after removal of Phragmites, however, not only returned species assemblages typical of reference (uninvaded) Spartina, but stable isotope signatures suggest that the trophic interactions among the arthropods were also similar in reestablished habitats. Specifically, both herbivores and predators showed characteristic Spartina signatures, suggesting the return of the original grazer-based food web structure in the restored habitats.",Animals and *Arthropods and Carbon Isotopes and *Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem and *Food Chain and New Jersey and Nitrogen Isotopes and *Poaceae and Seawater,2006/06/24 09:00,10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[0622:afwrfr]2.0.co;2 [doi],16711049,9889808,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Compound specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids showed the trophic position of both populations was just under four. Quantitative and isotopic analysis of neutral lipid fatty acid of Sipsey River bass indicated a greater reliance upon the detrital component of the food web compared to Demopolis Reservoir bass which fed within the autochthonous, pelagic component of the food web.

Sea ice conditions in McMurdo Sound were quantified from time series of MODIS satellite images for Sept. 1 through Feb. 28 of 2007-2015. A predictable sea ice persistence gradient along the length of the Sound and evidence for a distinct change in sea ice dynamics in 2011 were observed. We used stable isotope analysis (δ(13) C and δ(15) N) of SIMCo, suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) and shallow water (10-20 m) macroinvertebrates to reveal patterns in trophic structure of, and incorporation of organic matter from SIMCo into, benthic communities at eight sites distributed along the sea ice persistence gradient. Mass-balance analysis revealed distinct trophic architecture among communities and large fluxes of SIMCo into the near-shore food web, with the estimates ranging from 2 to 84% of organic matter derived from SIMCo for individual species. Analysis of patterns in density, and biomass of macroinvertebrate communities among sites allowed us to model net incorporation of organic matter from SIMCo, in terms of biomass per unit area (g/m(2) ), into benthic communities. Here, organic matter derived from SIMCo supported 39 to 71 per cent of total biomass. Furthermore, for six species, we observed declines in contribution of SIMCo between years with persistent sea ice (2008-2009) and years with extensive sea ice breakout (2012-2015). Our data demonstrate the vital role of SIMCo in ecosystem function in Antarctica and strong linkages between sea ice dynamics and near-shore secondary productivity.

Invasion by vascular plants in coastal wetlands, and by cordgrasses (Spartina spp.) in particular, are increasing in incidence globally, with dramatic ecosystem-level consequences. We examined the trophic consequences of invasion by a Spartina hybrid (S. alterniflora x S. foliosa) in San Francisco Bay (USA) by documenting differences in biomass and trophic structure of benthic communities between sediments invaded by Spartina and uninvaded sediments. We found the invaded system shifted from an algae-based to a detritus-based food web. We then tested for a relationship between diet and tolerance to invasion, hypothesizing that species that consume Spartina detritus are more likely to inhabit invaded sediments than those that consume surface algae. Infaunal diets were initially examined with natural abundance stable isotope analyses and application of mixing models, but these yielded an ambiguous picture of food sources. Therefore, we conducted isotopic enrichment experiments by providing 15N-labeled Spartina detritus both on and below the sediment surface in areas that either contained Spartina or were unvegetated. Capitellid and nereid polychaetes, and oligochaetes, groups shown to persist following Spartina invasion of San Francisco Bay tidal flats, took up 15N from labeled native and invasive Spartina detritus. In contrast, we found that amphipods, bivalves, and other taxa less tolerant to invasion consumed primarily surficial algae, based on 13C enrichment experiments. Habitat (Spartina vs. unvegetated patches) and location of detritus (on or within sediments) did not affect 15N uptake from detritus.

However, few studies have examined factors affecting the variable Hg concentrations in landlocked Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) or the biomagnification of Hg through their food webs. We estimated the food web structure of six high Arctic lakes near Resolute Bay, Nunavut, Canada, using stable carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotopes and measured Hg (total Hg (THg) in char, the only fish species, and methylmercury (MeHg) in chironomids and zooplankton) concentrations in biota collected in 2010 and 2011. Across lakes, δ(13)C showed that benthic carbon (chironomids) was the dominant food source for char. Regression models of log Hg versus δ(15)N (of char and benthic invertebrates) showed positive and significant slopes, indicting Hg biomagnification in all lakes, and higher slopes in some lakes than others. However, no principal components (PC) generated using all water chemistry data and physical characteristics of the lakes predicted the different slopes. The PC dominated by aqueous ions was a negative predictor of MeHg concentrations in chironomids, suggesting that water chemistry affects Hg bioavailability and MeHg concentrations in these lower-trophic-level organisms. Furthermore, regression intercepts were predicted by the PCs dominated by catchment area, aqueous ions, and MeHg. Weaker relationships were also found between THg in small char or MeHg in pelagic invertebrates and the PCs dominated by catchment area, and aqueous nitrate and MeHg. Results from these high Arctic lakes suggest that Hg biomagnification differs between systems and that their physical and chemical characteristics affect Hg concentrations in lower-trophic-level biota.","Animals and Aquatic Organisms/*metabolism and Arctic Regions and Canada and *Environmental Monitoring and *Food Chain and Lakes and Mercury/*metabolism and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*metabolism",2015/06/06 06:00,S0048-9697(14)00664-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.04.133 [doi],24909711,0330500,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",Netherlands,Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we use herring gull (Larus argentatus) eggs to evaluate temporal changes in total mercury (THg) availability from two locations on Great Slave Lake (GSL), Northwest Territories, Canada. Egg THg concentrations increased through time, but this change was due to shifts in gull diets. Stable nitrogen isotopes allowed adjustment of egg THg concentrations for dietary changes. Diet-adjusted egg THg concentrations showed no long-term trend. Consistent with that result, new statistical analysis of THg concentrations in three species of GSL fish showed minor or no temporal changes. Although a long-term trend was absent, inter-year differences in adjusted egg THg concentrations persisted. Contributions of environmental variables (i.e., river flow, lake level, air temperature, precipitation, and wildfire) to these differences were investigated. Egg THg concentrations were greater following years of lower lake levels and greater wildfire extent. Lake level could have affected mercury methylation. Increased wildfire could have enhanced terrestrial Hg releases to the atmosphere where it was transported long distances to GSL. Climate change may increase wildfire extent with impacts on Hg bioaccumulation in northern ecosystems. Egg Hg levels reported here are unlikely to pose health risks to gulls, but in light of ongoing environmental change, monitoring should continue. Our study emphasizes the importance of ancillary datasets in elucidating Hg trends; such information will be critical for evaluating the effectiveness of Hg mitigation strategies implemented as part of the Minamata Convention.","Animals and Birds and Canada and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and Humans and Lakes and *Mercury/analysis and Northwest Territories and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2021/02/20 06:00,S0048-9697(20)38145-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144614 [doi],33421792,0330500,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",Netherlands,Crown Copyright © 2021.

Temporal variations of transpiration, depth of water uptake and tree water sources were examined for three dominant, brevi-deciduous species using micrometeorological, sap flow and soil moisture measurements, in combination with oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope composition of rainfall, tree xylem, soil and stream water. Over the course of the dry season, reductions in crown conductance and transpiration were observed in canopy species (43 and 34%, respectively) and mid-story trees (23 and 8%), as atmospheric demand increased and soil moisture decreased. Canopy species consistently showed more depleted isotope values compared to mid-story trees. However, MixSIAR Bayesian model results showed that the evaporated (enriched) soil water pool was the main source for trees despite reduced soil moisture. Additionally, while increases in tree water uptake from deeper to shallower soil water sources occurred, concomitant decreases in transpiration were observed as the dry season progressed.

It is important to link these approaches to community analysis as the abundance and behaviour of species, populations or trophic groups can have a profound effect on nutrient budgets. METHODS: We determined the carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of coral reef organic matter sources and macro-benthic invertebrate communities using a Europa Geo 20/20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer interfaced to an ANCA-SL elemental analyzer in continuous flow mode. Isotopic ecology metrics and a mixing model were used to analyze and interpret the data. RESULTS: The coral reef macro-invertebrate community principally relies on detrital or recycled food sources. An increased reliance on reef nitrogen-derived sources was observed in the cold-dry season. The community food-web lengths differ noticeably across the coral reef and reflect the characteristics and origin of organic matter reservoirs. CONCLUSIONS: Anthropogenic and terrestrial inputs lead to a loss of biological diversity. Exclusive dominance of suspension-feeding species is observed in areas receiving direct surface riverine particulate organic matter. The accumulation of sediment organic matter in eutrophic areas leads to dominance of deposit-feeding species.

The MeHg body burden in birds is the balance of ingestion and excretion, and MeHg in feathers is an effective indicator of overall MeHg burden. Ivory gulls (Pagophila eburnea), which consume ice-associated prey and scavenge marine mammal carcasses, have the highest egg Hg concentrations of any Arctic bird, and the species has declined by more than 80% since the 1980s in Canada. We used feathers from museum specimens from the Canadian Arctic and western Greenland to assess whether exposure to MeHg by ivory gulls increased from 1877 to 2007. Based on constant feather stable-isotope (δ(13)C, δ(15)N) values, there was no significant change in ivory gulls' diet over this period, but feather MeHg concentrations increased 45× (from 0.09 to 4.11 µg g(-1) in adults). This dramatic change in the absence of a dietary shift is clear evidence of the impact of anthropogenic Hg on this high-latitude threatened species. Bioavailable Hg is expected to increase in the Arctic, raising concern for continued population declines in high-latitude species that are far from sources of environmental contaminants.","Animals and Arctic Regions and Canada and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Charadriiformes/*metabolism and Diet and Endangered Species and *Environmental Exposure and Environmental Monitoring and Feathers/*chemistry and Female and Greenland and Male and Methylmercury Compounds/*metabolism and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Seasons and Time Factors and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*metabolism",2015/12/15 06:00,rspb.2015.0032 [pii] and rspb20150032 [pii] and 10.1098/rspb.2015.0032 [doi],25788594,101245157,"0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Methylmercury Compounds) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",England,© 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We sampled invertebrates above and below a series of dams, over two years, at both downwelling and upwelling zones. In each zone, we recorded the daily temperature and flow variations, estimated the algal development, measured the available resources, and analysed carbon and nitrogen stable isotope compositions of the invertebrate community. The number of hydrological pulses were typically higher below the dams than above the dams especially during high-flow periods whereas the groundwater outlets had minor effects on invertebrate assemblages. Invertebrate abundance, richness and diversity tended to decrease below the dams. Co-inertia analysis showed that flow and temperature variations, and eutrophication explained most of the variance in the invertebrate assemblages, which comprised a higher number of resilient taxa below than above the dams. The proportions of pesticide-sensitive invertebrates were lower below the dams and ovoviviparous and more generalist taxa were prominent. We did not observe the expected CPOM decrease and FPOM increase downstream. Accordingly, the proportions of each functional feeding group were remarkably similar above and below the dams despite the long distance between the sectors (>100 kms). The diversity of basal resources used within assemblages progressively increased downstream above dams. In contrast, the diversity of resources used by organisms below the dams decreased from upstream to downstream suggesting a significant influence of flow regulation on aquatic food webs. Finally, the shorter trophic chains for the invertebrate assemblages below the dams suggests that the effects of stream regulation and eutrophication induced a simplification of food webs. To our knowledge, this study is the first to connect taxonomic and functional trait changes in response to multiple stressors with the associated modifications in isotopic niches within aquatic invertebrate assemblages. CONTEXT: Understanding how stream regulation and associated anthropogenic pressures act on aquatic assemblages and trophic niches is necessary to guide management actions. GOAL: We aimed to investigate the functional responses (traits and trophic niches) of aquatic invertebrate assemblages to stream regulation and eutrophication. METHODS: We used univariate and multivariate analyses to compare the invertebrate assemblages above and below the dams and to assess the contributions of hydrology (including groundwater supplies to the river), temperature and eutrophication to the variability in the composition of invertebrate assemblages. We also considered the relative utilization of a selected set of traits describing invertebrate resilience, resistance and specialization to address the potential functional effects of stream regulation on invertebrate assemblages. Finally, carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses allowed us to characterize the length and width of invertebrate assemblage food webs as related to the availability and diversity of basal resources. RESULTS: Invertebrate abundance and richness generally decreased below the dams, with the highest impacts on insect taxa. Co-inertia analysis showed that stream regulation and eutrophication were main drivers of the aquatic invertebrate assemblages. The analysis separated the sites above and below the dams according to flow and temperature variation, whereas eutrophication appeared as a secondary stressor that separated the sites within each sector. Furthermore, the series of dams resulted in (i) a higher proportion of resilient (e.g., multivoltine) and resistant (ovoviviparous) taxa and a majority of generalists in assemblages below dams, (ii) an impact on the classical dynamics of CPOM (decrease) and FPOM (increase) sources from upstream to downstream, and (iii) a reduction in the diversity of resource use and in the trophic chain length of invertebrate assemblages below dams. The cooler and less oxygenated upwelling zones had lower invertebrate abundance; however, contrary to our expectation, the variation in the groundwater supply did not affect the composition of epigean invertebrate assemblages. CONCLUSION: This study provides insights about the impacts of flow regime alteration and eutrophication on food webs that may have been caused by regulation of permanent streams. To our knowledge, this is the first to connect taxonomic and functional trait changes in response to multiple stressors with the associated modifications in energy fluxes in aquatic invertebrate assemblages. This study suggests that bed stability, which is associated with a reduction in channel mobility below the dams and with moderate eutrophication, may provide the shelter and resources that can locally favour invertebrate assemblage dynamics and lessen the effects of flow regulation. In addition, the study suggests that the biological trait-based approach and isotope analysis are complementary approaches for addressing ecosystem functioning. The relative utilization of traits indicates the functional potential of aquatic invertebrate assemblages to face multiple stressors whereas isotope analysis is an expression of the actual effect of the stressors on the trophic structure of aquatic invertebrate assemblages.",Animals and *Ecosystem and Food Chain and Hydrology and *Invertebrates and Rivers,2021/05/06 06:00,S0048-9697(21)00127-3 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145061 [doi],33940713,0330500,NA,Netherlands,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, stocking practices using fast-growing species can result in low fish total Hg (THg) concentrations. Here, we describe Hg transfer within the fish food web of a large subtropical reservoir, Qiandao Hu (Xin'anjiang reservoir) situated in eastern China. We measured food web Hg biomagnification and THg concentrations in 33 species of stocked and wild fishes. Mercury concentrations in most fishes were low, though we also found high Hg concentrations in wild top predators. The food web structure, assessed using stable isotopes of carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N), demonstrated a high degree of omnivory and a long food chain.

However, uncertainties remain regarding the use of δ2H, since little is known about the potential variation in the amount of exchangeable hydrogen (Hex) among common sample materials or the patterns of δ2H when entire food webs are considered. We assessed differences in Hex among the typical sample materials in freshwater studies and used δ2H, δ13C and δ15N to compare their effectiveness in tracing allochthonous matter in food webs of two small temperate lakes. Our results showed higher average amounts of Hex in animal tissues (27% in fish and macroinvertebrates, 19% in zooplankton) compared to most plant material (15% in terrestrial plants and 8% in seston/periphyton), with the exception of aquatic vascular plants (23%, referred to as macrophytes). The amount of Hex correlated strongly with sample lipid content (inferred from C:N ratios) in fish and zooplankton samples. Overall, the three isotopes provided good separation of sources (seston, periphyton, macrophytes and allochthonous organic matter), particularly the δ2H followed by δ13C. Aquatic macrophytes revealed unexpectedly high δ2H values, having more elevated δ2H values than terrestrial organic matter with direct implications for estimating consumer allochthony.

The Mar Piccolo of Taranto is a densely populated area at a high risk of environmental crisis. Here, planktonic primary production (PP) and heterotrophic prokaryotic production (HPP) were measured as proxies of functioning in three sampling sites located in two inlets at different levels of industrial contamination, during three sampling surveys (June 2013, February and April 2014). To have a better overall view and provide some insights into the benthic-pelagic coupling, we integrated PP and HPP in the water column with those in the sediments and then discussed this with the origin of the organic matter pools based on analysis of stable isotopes. Heavy metals and polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) were also analysed in the surface (1 cm) sediment layer and related to the overall ecosystem functioning. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, based on the main data, clearly separated the second inlet from the first one, more severely impacted by anthropogenic activities. The stable isotope mixing model suggested the prevalent terrestrial/riverine origin of the particulate organic matter pools (mean 45.5 %) in all sampling periods, whereas phytoplankton contributed up to 29 % in February. Planktonic PP and HPP rates followed the same pattern over the entire study period and seemed to respond to phytoplankton dynamics confirming this community as the main driver for the C cycling in the water column. On the contrary, benthic PP rates were almost negligible while HPP rates were lower or comparable to those in the water column indicating that although the Mar Piccolo is very shallow, the water column is much more productive than the surface sediments. The sediment resuspension is likely responsible for a pulsed input of contaminants into the water column. However, their interference with the proper functioning of the pelagic ecosystem seems to be limited to the bottom layers.","Carbon/*analysis and *Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and Italy and Organic Chemicals/*analysis and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*analysis",2017/04/01 06:00,10.1007/s11356-015-4997-2 [pii] and 10.1007/s11356-015-4997-2 [doi],26162444,9441769,"0 (Organic Chemicals) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and 7440-44-0 (Carbon)",Germany,NA,10.1007/s11356-015-4997-2 [doi],Benthic-pelagic coupling and C and N stable isotopes and Contamination and Ecosystem functioning and Heterotrophic prokaryotic production and Primary production and Satellite imagery mapping,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They add novel habitat for hard-substrate organisms and modify the surrounding environment. Most research to date has focused on the communities living directly on artificial structures, and more research is needed on the potential impacts these structures have on nearby communities and the surrounding environment. We compared the sedimentary habitat surrounding two types of artificial structures (pilings and seawalls) to sediments adjacent to rocky reefs using a combination of traditional sediment analyses, stable isotope analysis, and environmental DNA. Artificial and natural shore sediments were best differentiated by sediment variables strongly associated with flow speed. Pilings sediments had significantly finer grain size, higher organic content, and generally lower C:N ratios than sediments adjacent to the other habitat types, suggesting flow is reduced by pilings. Sedimentary assemblages near pilings were also consistent with those predicted under low-flow conditions, with elevated bacterial colonization and increased relative abundances of small deposit feeders compared with other habitat types. Additionally, lumbrinerid polychaetes in pilings sediments had reduced δ(15)N values, suggesting different detrital resources and fewer trophic linkages compared with lumbrinerids in other habitats. Woody detritus was greater adjacent to seawalls than to natural rocky shores or pilings. Our findings suggest that artificial structures have the potential to influence adjacent soft sediments through changes to sediment properties that affect infaunal and microbial communities, as well as trophic linkages for some consumers. We hypothesize that this is due to a combination of altered flow, differing detrital subsidies, and differing adjacent land-use among habitat types. Managers should consider the potential for changed sediment properties and ecology when deciding where to build different types of artificial structures.

Millions of people in the lake basin depend on several fish species for consumption. Due to the importance of fish consumption as an exposure route of mercury to humans, we sampled Lake Tanganyika in 2000 to assess total mercury concentrations and biomagnification of total mercury through the food web. Stable nitrogen and carbon isotope analyses of food web structure indicate a complex food web with overlapping omnivory with some specialist fish species. Stable nitrogen isotope analyses further confirm that mercury is biomagnifying through the Tanganyika food web at rates similar to those seen in Lakes Malawi and Victoria, the other two African Great Lakes. Most collected fish species and all invertebrate species had mercury concentrations below 0.2 microg Hg/g wet weight.

In the present study, we detected the concentrations of PCBs, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (DDTs) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) in muscle, liver and kidney of birds that inhabit in an e-waste recycling site. Associated with the stable isotope ratio (δ (15)N), we investigated the effect of trophic level on the body burdens of persistent contaminants in birds. The tissue distributions of contaminants in these birds were examined, and a preliminary risk assessment was also conducted. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens from eight bird species were collected from Qingyuan County, Guangdong Province, South China. Pectoral muscle, liver and kidney tissues were Soxhlet-extracted and finally dissolved in isooctane. Both PCBs and OCPs were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The subsamples for nitrogen stable isotope analysis were lyophilized, ground and analyzed by a flash EA 112 series elemental analyzer interfaced with an isotope ration mass spectrometer. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: PCBs exhibited the highest concentrations among all target compounds, and a preliminary risk assessment suggested that adverse effects might occur in some birds for its high level. Generally, the concentrations of pollutants in liver and kidney were higher than those in muscle, which was mainly driven by passive diffusion to the 'lipid-compartment'. Significant differences in level of contaminants were obtained among species due to the varieties in dietary composition and habitat. An increasing trend was obtained between concentrations of PCBs and DDTs with trophic levels; however, HCHs exhibited the same level among species. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: Because of the e-waste recycling activities, the study area has been heavily polluted by PCBs. Studies on the species-specific hazard assessment associated with exposure to PCBs are urgently needed in the study of birds in the area.","Animals and Birds/*metabolism and China and Electronic Waste/analysis/statistics & numerical data and Environmental Monitoring and Environmental Pollutants/*metabolism and Food Chain and Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated/*metabolism and Kidney/metabolism and Liver/metabolism and Muscles/metabolism and Pesticides/*metabolism and Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*metabolism and Risk Assessment and Tissue Distribution and Waste Management/methods",2011/06/15 06:00,10.1007/s11356-010-0397-9 [doi],20922489,9441769,"0 (Environmental Pollutants) and 0 (Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated) and 0 (Pesticides) and DFC2HB4I0K (Polychlorinated Biphenyls)",Germany,NA,10.1007/s11356-010-0397-9 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One advantage of dietary shifts for a consumer is the ability to gain complementary resources from different foods. In addition, dietary shifts often affect food-web dynamics. Despite the importance of dietary shifts to organismal, community, and ecosystem ecology, empirical studies of the ecological mechanisms that control dietary shifts are limited in scope. In this study, we tested the effects of complementary resources on dietary shifts of an omnivorous mammal, the white-footed mouse Peromyscus leucopus, in the context of depletable food patches in the natural environment. We used two complementary resources: seeds that provide a higher energy gain per unit handling time and mealworms that provide a higher protein gain per unit handling time. Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen (delta13C, delta15N) in mouse plasma were used to quantify dietary shifts, and we determined giving-up density (GUD), the food density at which a forager leaves a food patch (for an optimal forager, it should correspond to the quitting harvest rate that balances net fitness gain with various costs of foraging). The results showed that GUD increased most significantly when a mixture of seeds and mealworms was added, compared to when only seeds or mealworms were added. This suggests that, given a similar level of food availability, a patch with a mixture of complementary foods is of higher quality than a patch with only one type of food. Moreover, GUD measured with seeds (GUDs) correlated positively with seed availability, and GUD measured with mealworms (GUDmw) correlated positively with mealworm availability, indicating that the marginal value of seeds or mealworms decreases with their relatively availability in the environment. As GUDs increased, P. leucopus shifted their diets toward higher trophic levels, and as GUDmw increased, P. leucopus shifted their diets toward lower trophic levels, suggesting dietary shifts driven by food complementarity. This study demonstrated that the combination of giving-up density and stable-isotope analysis holds great potential for testing ecological mechanisms underlying dietary shifts.",Animals and Carbon Isotopes and *Diet and Food and Nitrogen Isotopes and Panicum and Peromyscus/*physiology and Seeds and Tenebrio,2007/05/23 09:00,10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[87:gdadsi]2.0.co;2 [doi],17489457,0043541,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, the simultaneous uptake and elimination of cadmium (Cd) in stream-dwelling caddisfly (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae) larvae was measured in laboratory experiments with stable isotopes of Cd. In one experiment, animals were exposed to low levels (0.5 microg/L) of 114Cd in filtered river water and uptake was measured for 9 d, followed by 9 d during which the larvae were exposed to either 114Cd, 113Cd, or filtered river water. In a second experiment, the initial exposure concentration of 114Cd varied from 0.1 to 1.6 microg/L for 5 d, followed by 5 d during which the larvae were exposed to the same respective levels of 113Cd. The purpose of the two experiments was to test whether or not elimination of 114Cd from Hydropsyche larvae was the same in the presence or absence of Cd in the water and also whether or not elimination rates were dependent on exposure concentration. The results indicated that elimination of Cd by Hydropsyche larvae (elimination rate constant approximately 0.21-0.24/d) in the presence of Cd in the water was the same as the depuration when no metal was present. Furthermore, the elimination rate was independent of exposure concentrations, ranging between 0.1 and 1.6 microg/L. Thus, the stable isotope tracer technique enabled the simultaneous measurement of uptake and elimination of Cd in hydropsychid larvae and may have the potential to facilitate the labeling of various compartments (e.g., water, sediment, and food) in the aquatic environment.","Animals and Cadmium/*pharmacokinetics and Dose-Response Relationship, Drug and *Environmental Exposure and Food Chain and Geologic Sediments and *Insecta and Isotopes/pharmacokinetics and Larva/physiology and Mass Spectrometry and Water Pollutants/*pharmacokinetics",2002/11/26 04:00,NA,12013125,8308958,0 (Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants) and 00BH33GNGH (Cadmium),United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Research has only recently begun to assess fracking impacts to surrounding environments, and very little research is aimed at determining effects on aquatic biodiversity and contaminant biomagnification. Twenty-seven remotely-located streams in Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale basin were sampled during June and July of 2012 and 2013. At each stream, stream physiochemical properties, trophic biodiversity, and structure and mercury levels were assessed. We used δ15N, δ13C, and methyl mercury to determine whether changes in methyl mercury biomagnification were related to the fracking occurring within the streams' watersheds. While we observed no difference in rates of biomagnificaion related to within-watershed fracking activities, we did observe elevated methyl mercury concentrations that were influenced by decreased stream pH, elevated dissolved stream water Hg values, decreased macroinvertebrate Index for Biotic Integrity scores, and lower Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera macroinvertebrate richness at stream sites where fracking had occurred within their watershed. We documented the loss of scrapers from streams with the highest well densities, and no fish or no fish diversity at streams with documented frackwater fluid spills. Our results suggest fracking has the potential to alter aquatic biodiversity and methyl mercury concentrations at the base of food webs.","Biodiversity and *Environmental Monitoring and *Food Chain and *Hydraulic Fracking and Mercury/*analysis and Pennsylvania and Rivers and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*analysis",2017/01/07 06:00,10.1007/s10646-016-1717-8 [pii] and 10.1007/s10646-016-1717-8 [doi],27743207,9885956,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",United States,NA,NA,Aquatic ecology and Biodiversity and Biomagnification and Hydraulic fracturing and Marcellus shale and Stable isotopes,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Three sites representing a large range of lake benthic-pelagic structures (based on depth and shoreline characteristics) and precipitation regimes were sampled. Nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes (δ(15)N, δ(13)C) were analyzed to assess Hg trophodynamics. Selenium concentrations were determined together with THg in order to consider its potential effect on Hg trophodynamics. High THg concentrations (0.1-255 µg g(-1) dry weight (DW)) were measured in plankton, largely in inorganic form (MeHg: 3-29 ng g(-1) DW, 0.02-7% of THg, in the two larger size classes). A trend of increasing THg concentrations, varying in two to three orders of magnitude, with decreasing plankton size was associated with precipitation measured prior to each sampling event. Passive adsorption of dissolved Hg(2+) from wet deposition and runoff is considered to be the principal Hg uptake mechanism at the base of the pelagic food web. Despite the initially high THg uptake in the smaller plankton classes, the transfer to G. maculatus, and consequently to the entire food web, is likely limited due to low proportion of MeHg to THg in plankton. Furthermore, evidence of G. maculatus with benthic feeding habits having higher impact on MeHg trophic transfer compared to the same species with more pelagic (e.g., zooplankton) feeding habits, was observed. Although there is a high THg uptake in plankton, limited amounts are incorporated in the entire food web from the pelagic compartment.","Animals and Argentina and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Environmental Monitoring and *Fishes and *Food Chain and Lakes and Mercury/*analysis and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Plankton/*chemistry and Selenium/analysis and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*analysis",2015/03/04 06:00,10.1007/s10646-014-1260-4 [doi],24844168,9885956,"0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury) and H6241UJ22B (Selenium)",United States,NA,10.1007/s10646-014-1260-4 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Average δ(13)C and δ(15)N values in oyster shell (-21 ± 1‰ and 9-11‰, respectively) were consistent with consumption of naturally available SPM as opposed to values in oil (-27 ± 0.2‰, 1.6 ± 0.4‰). Stable isotope ratios in oyster adductor muscle were similar to shell for δ(15)N but not δ(13)C, suggesting either a recent shift in diet composition or differential assimilation of C between tissue types. We found no evidence of assimilation of oil-derived C and N and, therefore, no evidence of an oyster-based conduit to higher trophic levels. Trace elements in shell were inconclusive to corroborate oil exposure.

In October 1999, April 2000, and October 2000, meso- and macrofauna and maize and rye litter were collected in each plot and analyzed for 13C and 15N content. 15N signatures suggested that the soil animal species analyzed span three trophic levels with the trophic position of species varying little in time. The species investigated formed a continuum from primary to secondary decomposers to predators. On average, predator species differed from primary and secondary decomposers by 3.9 sigma15N suggesting that they fed on a mixed diet of both decomposer groups. The combined analysis of 13C and 15N signatures allowed us to identify links between prey and consumer species. In October 1999, shortly after maize residues had been incorporated into the plots, maize-born carbon was present in each of the animal species investigated, including top predators. The incorporation of maize carbon into the belowground food web increased during the following 12 months but the concentration of maize-born carbon never exceeded 50% in any of the species. Furthermore, the ranks of the incorporation of maize-born carbon of the species changed little. The results suggest that the belowground food web relies heavily on carbon originating from plant residues from before the recent two growing seasons. In most species the amount of maize-born carbon increased continuously; however, in some species it decreased during winter, suggesting that these species switched to a diet based more on C3 plants during winter, or predominantly metabolized carbon incorporated during the last growing season.

While CO(2) stimulates net primary production, O(3) reduces photosynthesis, altering plant C allocation and reducing ecosystem C storage. The effects of multiple air pollutants can alter belowground C allocation, leading to changes in the partial pressure of CO(2) (pCO(2)) in the soil , chemistry of dissolved inorganic carbonate (DIC) and the rate of mineral weathering. As this system represents a linkage between the long- and short-term C cycles and sequestration of atmospheric CO(2), changes in atmospheric chemistry that affect net primary production may alter the fate of C in these ecosystems. To date, little is known about the combined effects of elevated CO(2) and O(3) on the inorganic C cycle in forest systems. Free air CO(2) and O(3) enrichment (FACE) technology was used at the Aspen FACE project in Rhinelander, Wisconsin to understand how elevated atmospheric CO(2) and O(3) interact to alter pCO(2) and DIC concentrations in the soil. Ambient and elevated CO(2) levels were 360+/-16 and 542+/-81 microl l(-1), respectively; ambient and elevated O(3) levels were 33+/-14 and 49+/-24 nl l(-1), respectively. Measured concentrations of soil CO(2) and calculated concentrations of DIC increased over the growing season by 14 and 22%, respectively, under elevated atmospheric CO(2) and were unaffected by elevated tropospheric O(3). The increased concentration of DIC altered inorganic carbonate chemistry by increasing system total alkalinity by 210%, likely due to enhanced chemical weathering. The study also demonstrated the close coupling between the seasonal delta(13)C of soil pCO(2) and DIC, as a mixing model showed that new atmospheric CO(2) accounted for approximately 90% of the C leaving the system as DIC. This study illustrates the potential of using stable isotopic techniques and FACE technology to examine long- and short-term ecosystem C sequestration.","Air Pollutants/*analysis and Analysis of Variance and Atmosphere/*chemistry and Carbon Dioxide/*analysis and Carbon Isotopes and Carbonates/*chemistry and *Models, Chemical and Ozone/*analysis and Partial Pressure and Seasons and Soil/*analysis and Wisconsin",2005/03/30 09:00,10.1007/s00442-004-1665-5 [doi],15378342,0150372,0 (Air Pollutants) and 0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Carbonates) and 0 (Soil) and 142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide) and 66H7ZZK23N (Ozone),Germany,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Automated enzymatic on-site measurements of stream water and sediments were made over two years (2014-2016) to quantify the sources and pathways of GLUC in a stream. The event water fraction of streamflow was estimated by stable isotopes. Samples from field sediments on a hillslope, streambed sediment and stream water were analyzed for GLUC and with a standard E. coli assay. The results showed ten times higher GLUC and E. coli concentrations during the summer than during the winter for all compartments (field and streambed sediments and stream water). The E. coli concentrations in the streambed sediment were approximately 100 times those of the field sediments. Of the total GLUC load in the study period, 39% were transported during hydrological events (increased streamflow due to rainfall or snowmelt); of these, 44% were transported when the stream contained no recent rainwater. The results suggested that a large proportion of the GLUC and E. coli in the stream water stemmed from resuspended streambed sediments.

Both diet and isotope results indicated that the S. alpinus population relied mainly on littoral benthic energy sources. The strong littoral reliance appeared largely independent of season or fish size, although the data lacked small (total length, L(T), <130 mm) and young (<3 years) S. alpinus. Liver isotope values of intermediate-sized S. alpinus (200-350 mm), however, suggested exploitation of the increase in the abundance of pelagic zooplankton in the late open-water season. The results suggest that, in general, a strong littoral reliance of fishes can be a feature in subarctic lakes throughout the year.

Most studies addressing the causes of the recent increases and expansions of mesopredators in many ecosystems have focused on the top-down, releasing effect of extinctions of large apex predators. However, in the case of the northward expansion of the red fox into the arctic tundra, a bottom-up effect of increased resource availability has been proposed, an effect that can counteract prey shortage in the low phase of the multi-annual rodent cycle. Resource subsidies both with marine and with terrestrial origins could potentially be involved. 2. During different phases of a multi-annual rodent cycle, we investigated the seasonal dynamics and spatial pattern of resource use by red foxes across a coast to inland low arctic tundra gradient, Varanger Peninsula, Norway. We employed two complementary methods of diet analyses: stomach contents and stable isotope analysis. 3. We found that inland red foxes primarily subsisted on reindeer carrions during the low phase of a small rodent population cycle. Lemmings became the most important food item towards the peak phase of the rodent cycle, despite being less abundant than sympatric voles. Isotopic signatures of tissue from both predator and prey also revealed that red foxes near the coast used marine-derived subsidies in the winter, but these allochthonous resources did not spillover to adult foxes living beyond 20-25 km from the coast. 4. Although more needs to be learned about the link between increasing primary productivity due to climatic warming and trophic dynamics in tundra ecosystems, we suggest that changes in reindeer management through a bottom-up effect, at least regionally, may have paved the way towards the establishment of a new mesopredator in the tundra biome.","*Adaptation, Biological and Animals and Aquatic Organisms and Arctic Regions and Arvicolinae and *Carnivory and *Conservation of Natural Resources and *Diet and Ecosystem and *Food Chain and *Foxes and Global Warming and Linear Models and Norway and Population Dynamics and Reindeer and Seasons",2012/03/06 06:00,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01840.x [doi],21477201,0376574,NA,England,© 2011 The Authors.

In boreal forest catchments, such as the one in northern Sweden studied here, mercury bound to natural organic matter (NOM) represents a large fraction of mercury in the runoff. We present a method to measure Hg stable isotope signatures of colloidal Hg, mainly complexed by high molecular weight or colloidal natural organic matter (NOM) in natural waters based on pre-enrichment by ultrafiltration, followed by freeze-drying and combustion. We report that Hg associated with high molecular weight NOM in the boreal forest runoff has very similar Hg isotope signatures as compared to the organic soil horizons of the catchment area. The mass-independent fractionation (MIF) signatures (Δ(199)Hg and Δ(200)Hg) measured in soils and runoff were in agreement with typical values reported for atmospheric gaseous elemental mercury (Hg(0)) and distinctly different from reported Hg isotope signatures in precipitation. We therefore suggest that most Hg in the boreal terrestrial ecosystem originated from the deposition of Hg(0) through foliar uptake rather than precipitation. Using a mixing model we calculated the contribution of soil horizons to the Hg in the runoff. At moderate to high flow runoff conditions, that prevailed during sampling, the uppermost part of the organic horizon (Oe/He) contributed 50-70% of the Hg in the runoff, while the underlying more humified organic Oa/Ha and the mineral soil horizons displayed a lower mobility of Hg. The good agreement of the Hg isotope results with other source tracing approaches using radiocarbon signatures and Hg : C ratios provides additional support for the strong coupling between Hg and NOM. The exploratory results from this study illustrate the potential of Hg stable isotopes to trace the source of Hg from atmospheric deposition through the terrestrial ecosystem to soil runoff, and provide a basis for more in-depth studies investigating the mobility of Hg in terrestrial ecosystems using Hg isotope signatures.",Chemical Fractionation and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring/*methods and Environmental Pollutants/*analysis/chemistry and Humic Substances/*analysis and Mercury/*analysis/chemistry and Mercury Isotopes/analysis and Rivers/chemistry and Soil/chemistry and Sweden and *Taiga,2018/02/24 06:00,10.1039/c7em00245a [doi],28825440,101601576,0 (Environmental Pollutants) and 0 (Humic Substances) and 0 (Mercury Isotopes) and 0 (Soil) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury),England,NA,10.1039/c7em00245a [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To date, no long-term empirical studies have confirmed that fish populations exhibit adaptive foraging behavior in response to temperature variation and the potential implications this has on fitness. Here, we use an unparalleled 11-y acoustic telemetry, stable isotope, and mark-recapture dataset to test if a population of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), a cold-water stenotherm, adjusted its use of habitat and energy sources in response to annual variations in lake temperatures during the open-water season and how these changes translated to the growth and condition of individual fish. We found that climate influenced access to littoral regions in spring (data from telemetry), which in turn influenced energy acquisition (data from isotopes), and growth (mark-recapture data). In more stressful years, those with shorter springs and longer summers, lake trout had reduced access to littoral habitat and assimilated less littoral energy, resulting in reduced growth and condition. Annual variation in prey abundance influenced lake trout foraging tactics (i.e., the balance of the number and duration of forays) but not the overall time spent in littoral regions. Lake trout greatly reduced their use of littoral habitat and occupied deep pelagic waters during the summer. Together, our results provide clear evidence that climate-mediated behavior can influence the dominant energy pathways of top predators, with implications ranging from individual fitness to food web stability.","Animals and Climate Change and Cold Temperature and Ecosystem and Feeding Behavior/*physiology and Food Chain and Lakes and Temperature and Trout/*growth & development/metabolism/*physiology and Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2018/06/27 06:00,1702584114 [pii] and 201702584 [pii] and 10.1073/pnas.1702584114 [doi],28808011,7505876,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",United States,NA,10.1073/pnas.1702584114 [doi],climate change and food web and habitat coupling and lake trout and north-temperate lake,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,PMC5604001,The authors declare no conflict of interest.,NA,NA,NA,NA,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017 Sep 12;114(37):9764-9765.

The cause of dietary variation within species is commonly an ontogenetic niche shift, which is a key dynamic influencing community structure. We quantified spatial and temporal variations in ringed seal (Pusa hispida) diet, niche size, and TP during ontogeny across the Arctic-a rapidly changing ecosystem. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis was performed on 558 liver and 630 muscle samples from ringed seals and on likely prey species from five locations ranging from the High to the Low Arctic. A modest ontogenetic diet shift occurred, with adult ringed seals consuming more forage fish (approximately 80 versus 60 %) and having a higher TP than subadults, which generally decreased with latitude. However, the degree of shift varied spatially, with adults in the High Arctic presenting a more restricted niche size and consuming more Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) than subadults (87 versus 44 %) and adults at the lowest latitude (29 %). The TPs of adult and subadult ringed seals generally decreased with latitude (4.7-3.3), which was mainly driven by greater complexity in trophic structure within the zooplankton communities. Adult isotopic niche size increased over time, likely due to the recent circumpolar increases in subarctic forage fish distribution and abundance. Given the spatial and temporal variability in ringed seal foraging ecology, ringed seals exhibit dietary plasticity as a species, suggesting adaptability in terms of their diet to climate change.","Animals and Arctic Regions and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and *Climate Change and *Diet and *Ecosystem and Fishes and Food Chain and *Ice and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Seals, Earless/*physiology and Time and Zooplankton",2016/08/10 06:00,10.1007/s00442-015-3384-5 [pii] and 10.1007/s00442-015-3384-5 [doi],26210748,0150372,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Ice) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),Germany,NA,10.1007/s00442-015-3384-5 [doi],Arctic and Ontogenetic niche shift and Ringed seal and Stable isotopes and Trophic position,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The δ(13)C gradient between mangrove and seagrass prey as well as results of Bayesian mixing models revealed that sampled fishes relied mostly on seagrass prey items.

Isotopic niche shifts were particularly obvious for carnivorous fishes that ingested larger prey items (Xanthidae crabs and fishes) during their ontogeny.

Although there has been considerable research into the dietary changes associated with the initial spread of farming, less attention has been given to how dietary choices continued to develop during subsequent millennia. A paleogenomic time transect for 5 millennia of human occupation in the Great Hungarian Plain spanning from the advent of the Neolithic to the Iron Age, showed major genomic turnovers. Here we assess where these genetic turnovers are associated with corresponding dietary shifts, by examining the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of 52 individuals. Results provide evidence that early Neolithic individuals, which were genetically characterised as Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, relied on wild resources to a greater extent than those whose genomic attributes were of typical Neolithic European farmers. Other Neolithic individuals and those from the Copper Age to Bronze Age periods relied mostly on terrestrial C3 plant resources. We also report a carbon isotopic ratio typical of C4 plants, which may indicate millet consumption in the Late Bronze Age, despite suggestions of the crop's earlier arrival in Europe during the Neolithic.","Agriculture/*history and *Anthropology, Cultural and *Diet and Female and History, Ancient and Humans and Hungary and Male",2018/08/01 06:00,PONE-D-18-01858 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0197214 [doi],29746569,101285081,NA,United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0197214 [doi] and e0197214,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC5944993,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous studies have used trophic shifts as indicators of food-web responses to perturbations, such as species invasion, and spatial or temporal subsidies. Resource pulses, as a form of temporal subsidies, have been found to be quite common among various ecosystems, affecting organisms at multiple trophic levels. Although diet switching of generalist consumers in response to resource pulses is well documented, few studies have examined if the switch involves trophic shifts, and if so, the directions and magnitudes of the shifts. In this study, we used stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes with a Bayesian multi-source mixing model to estimate proportional contributions of three trophic groups (i.e. producer, consumer, and fungus-detritivore) to the diets of the White-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) receiving an artificial seed pulse or a naturally-occurring cicadas pulse. Our results demonstrated that resource pulses can drive trophic shifts in the mice. Specifically, the producer contribution to the mouse diets was increased by 32% with the seed pulse at both sites examined. The consumer contribution to the mouse diets was also increased by 29% with the cicadas pulse in one of the two grids examined. However, the pattern was reversed in the second grid, with a 13% decrease in the consumer contribution with the cicadas pulse. These findings suggest that generalist consumers may play different functional roles in food webs under perturbations of resource pulses. This study provides one of the few highly quantitative descriptions on dietary and trophic shifts of a key consumer in forest food webs, which may help future studies to form specific predictions on changes in trophic interactions following resource pulses.",Animals and Diet and Feeding Behavior/*physiology and *Food Chain and Fungi/physiology and Hemiptera/physiology and Isotope Labeling and Peromyscus/*physiology and Virginia,2011/07/06 06:00,PONE-D-10-04205 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0017970 [doi],21437248,101285081,NA,United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0017970 [doi] and e17970,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC3060883,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Identifying the potential links between populations is one of the key tools that can improve the current management across fisheries areas. In addition to characterising populations' contamination state, chemical compounds can help refine foraging areas, individual flows and populations' structure, especially when combined with other intrinsic biogeochemical (trophic) markers such as carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes. This study investigated the bioaccumulation of seven selected trace metals - chromium, nickel, copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and lead - in the muscle of 443 albacore tunas, collected over two seasons and/or years in the western Indian Ocean (WIO: Reunion Island and Seychelles) and in the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean (SEAO: South Africa). The main factor that explained metal concentration variability was the geographic origin of fish, rather than the size and the sex of individuals, or the season/year of sampling. The elements Cu, Zn, Cd and Hg indicated a segregation of the geographic groups most clearly. For similar sized-individuals, tunas from SEAO had significantly higher concentrations in Cu, Zn and Cd, but lower Hg concentrations than those from WIO. Information inferred from the analysis of trophic markers (δ(13)C, δ(15)N) and selected persistent organic pollutants, as well as information on stomach contents, corroborated the geographical differences obtained by trace metals. It also highlighted the influence of trophic ecology on metal bioaccumulation. Finally, this study evidenced the potential of metals and chemical contaminants in general as tracers, by segregating groups of individuals using different food webs or habitats, to better understand spatial connectivity at the population scale. Limited flows of individuals between the SEAO and the WIO are suggested. Albacore as predatory fish also provided some information on environmental and food web chemical contamination in the different study areas.","Animals and Atlantic Ocean and *Environmental Monitoring and Geography and Indian Ocean and Metals, Heavy/*analysis and Seafood/*analysis and Seychelles and South Africa and Spatial Analysis and *Tuna and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*analysis",2018/07/31 06:00,S0048-9697(17)30883-5 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.048 [doi],28458223,0330500,"0 (Metals, Heavy) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",Netherlands,Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Alteration of litter dynamics represents one of the fundamental impacts of an invasive plant on salt marsh ecosystems. Tamarisk species (Tamarix spp.), which extensively invade terrestrial and riparian habitats, have been demonstrated to enter food webs in these ecosystems. However, the trophic impacts of the relatively new invasion of tamarisk into marine ecosystem have not been assessed. We evaluated the trophic consequences of invasion by tamarisk for detrital food chains in the Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve salt marsh using litter dynamics techniques and stable isotope enrichment experiments. The observations of a short residence time for tamarisk combined with relatively low C:N values indicate that tamarisk is a relatively available and labile food source. With an isotopic (15N) enrichment of tamarisk, we demonstrated that numerous macroinvertebrate taxonomic and trophic groups, both within and on the sediment, utilized 15N derived from labeled tamarisk detritus. Infaunal invertebrate species that took up no or limited 15N from labeled tamarisk (A. californica, enchytraeid oligochaetes, coleoptera larvae) occurred in lower abundance in the tamarisk-invaded environment. In contrast, species that utilized significant 15N from the labeled tamarisk, such as psychodid insects, an exotic amphipod, and an oniscid isopod, either did not change or occurred in higher abundance. Our research supports the hypothesis that invasive species can alter the trophic structure of an environment through addition of detritus and can also potentially impact higher trophic levels by shifting dominance within the invertebrate community to species not widely consumed.","Analysis of Variance and Animals and Conservation of Natural Resources and Feeding Behavior and *Food Chain and Invertebrates/*metabolism/physiology and Models, Biological and Multivariate Analysis and Nitrogen Isotopes/metabolism and *Tamaricaceae and *Wetlands",2009/03/13 09:00,10.1007/s00442-008-1144-5 [doi],18797931,0150372,0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),Germany,NA,10.1007/s00442-008-1144-5 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We examined the effects of changes in trophic position of an Arctic-breeding seabird, the thick-billed murre (Uria lomvia), on declining rates of six major organochlorines (hexachlorobenzene, heptachlor epoxide, oxychlordane, dieldrin, p,p'-DDE and Σ69PCB) at two breeding colonies in the Canadian Arctic, one in northern Hudson Bay and one in the high Arctic. As a result of a change in diet, murres breeding in Hudson Bay lowered their trophic position during 1993-2013. After adjusting for the change in trophic position using egg δ(15)N values, the rates of decline in concentrations of all six organochlorines were reduced in the Hudson Bay murre eggs. In contrast, the murres at the high Arctic colony experienced an increase in trophic position which resulted in an increase in the rates of decline for all adjusted concentrations, except for p,p'-DDE and Σ69PCB which remained relatively unchanged. This suggests that the dramatic reduction in emissions of these compounds during the 1970s/1980s had a greater influence on the time trends than changes in diet at the high Arctic colony. Linkages between climate change and food web processes are complex, and may have serious consequences for our understanding of contaminant temporal trends.

We presently investigated the temporal changes (1982-2010) in MeO-PBDPB concentrations and congener patterns, as well as chemical tracers of diet (ratios of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes), in egg pool homogenates from five selected colony sites across the Great Lakes. Egg pool homogenates from the Channel-Shelter (C-S) Island (Lake Huron) contained ∑MeO-PBDPB concentrations orders of magnitude greater than those from other colonies, suggesting potential point contamination sources nearby. In the C-S Island egg pools, concentrations increased from the initial study year (31 ng/g wet weight) and peaked around the late 1990s, followed by a general decline until 2010. Over the period, concentrations generally increased in eggs from Fighting Island (Lake Erie), Toronto Harbour (Lake Ontario) and Big Sister Island (Lake Michigan) colonies, whereas the levels in Agawa Rock (Lake Superior) declined. Although other factors likely exist, changes over time in the carbon and nitrogen isotope tracers reflected a shift of the gull diet from aquatic to more terrestrial origins, and suggested this diet shift partially accounted for the temporal changes of ∑MeO-PBDPB levels in eggs from most colonies. The ratio of Br(6)- to Br(5)-MeO-PBDPB congeners generally decreased over time in the colonies at Channel-Shelter Island, Fighting Island and Agawa Rock.

However, it is poorly understood to what extent different mercury (Hg) pools contribute to existent MMHg levels. In this study, ambient concentrations of total Hg (THg) and MMHg as well as rates of methylation and demethylation were measured simultaneously in sediments with and without salt-marsh plant vegetation, which were collected in Guadiana and Tagus estuaries, Portugal. Concurrent processes of Hg methylation and MMHg demethylation were directly monitored and compared by spiking sediments cores with stable isotope tracers of (199)Hg(2+) and CH(3)(201)Hg(+) followed by gas chromatographic separation and isotope-specific detection using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Compared to the Guadiana estuary, where concentrations were comparatively low, THg and MMHg levels varied between vegetated and non-vegetated sediments collected at the Rosário site (ROS) of the Tagus estuary. Methylation (K(M)) and demethylation rates (K(D)) were also different between estuaries being dependent on the presence of vegetation. In addition, the type of macrophyte species influenced K(M) and K(D) values. In fact, the highest K(M) value was found in Sarcocornia fruticosa vegetated sediments at the Castro Marim site in Guadiana (CM, 0.160 day(-1)) and the lowest K(M) was observed in non-vegetated sediments at the Alcochete site in Tagus (ALC, 0.009 day(-1)). K(D) varied by a factor of three among sites with highest rates of demethylation observed in non-vegetated sediments in Guadiana (12 ± 1.3 day(-1), corresponding to a half-life of 1.4 ± 0.2 h). This study clearly shows that the presence of vegetation in sediments favors the formation of MMHg. Moreover, this effect might be site specific and further studies are needed to confirm the findings reported here.","*Environmental Monitoring and Estuaries and Geologic Sediments/chemistry and Half-Life and Isotopes/analysis and Mercury/*analysis and Methylation and Methylmercury Compounds/*analysis and Plants and Portugal and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*analysis and *Wetlands",2017/07/25 06:00,S0269-7491(16)31852-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2017.03.075 [doi],28390703,8804476,"0 (Isotopes) and 0 (Methylmercury Compounds) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",England,Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Deforestation and the associated loss of species may trigger shifts in habitat and feeding preferences of persisting species.

I collected hair and used stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis to identify temporal changes in dietary source and trophic position, respectively. δ(13)C ratios were virtually identical, suggesting that macaques foraged in similar habitats during both time periods. However, δ(15)N ratios decreased considerably over time, suggesting that macaques today feed at a lower trophic level than previously. This decline in trophic level may be because of the disappearance or decline of other species that compete with macaques for fruit.

Here we explore the influence of trophic structure on total mercury (Hg) accumulation in red snapper (RS, Lutjanus campechanus) and gray snapper (GS, Lutjanus griseus) from the coastal Louisiana region of the Gulf of Mexico, west of the Mississippi River. The objectives of this investigation were to: (1) determine the effectiveness of the use of offshore recreational fishing charter boats and marinas as sources of fish samples and (2) compare species differences in Hg bioaccumulation, trophic position, and carbon sources. Our data show that length-normalized Hg concentrations (> or = 97% as MeHg in tissue of both species) were 230% greater in GS in comparison to RS collected from the same general area. Stable C and N isotope signatures (delta15N and delta13C) indicate that GS occupy a slightly higher trophic position (approximately 30% of one trophic position higher) on the Gulf food web in comparison to RS and that GS appear to incorporate higher trophic positioned prey, continually and at smaller sizes. Mercury was strongly correlated with combined delta15N and delta13C in pooled species data, arguing that most of the substantial difference in Hg bioaccumulation between RS and GS can be explained by modest differences in their trophic position and, to a lesser degree, carbon sources, which had low variation and high overlap among species. These observations demonstrate that even minor to moderate differences in trophic position and food habits in sympatric species can create relatively large differences in bioaccumulation regimes and underscores the importance of quantitative characterization of trophic structure in marine MeHg bioaccumulation studies.","Animals and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Environmental Monitoring/methods and Food Chain and Louisiana and Mercury/*metabolism and Methylmercury Compounds/*metabolism and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Perciformes/*metabolism and Seawater and Ships and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*metabolism",2008/02/15 09:00,10.1890/06-1422.1 [doi],17974344,9889808,"0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Methylmercury Compounds) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We used stable isotopes to trace spatial and seasonal responses of the downstream food web to winter and spring introductions of river water. Analysis of delta13C, delta15N, and delta34S in the common local consumers such as grass shrimp (Palaemonetes sp.), barnacles (Balanus sp.), and small plankton-feeding fish (bay anchovies, Anchoa mitchilli) showed that the diversion was associated with two of the five major source regimes that were supporting food webs: a river regime near the diversion and a river-influenced productive marsh regime farther away from the diversion. Mixing models identified a third river-influenced source regime at the marine end of the estuary where major natural discharge from the Bird's Foot Delta wraps around into estuarine waters. The remaining two source regimes represented typical estuarine conditions: local freshwater sources especially from precipitation and a brackish source regime representing higher salinity marine influences. Overall, the Mississippi River diversion accounted for 75% of food web support in the upper estuary and 25% in the middle estuary, with influence strongest along known flow pathways and closest to the diversion. Isotopes also traced seasonal changes in river contributions, and indicated increased plant community productivity along the major flow path of diversion water.

Mercury methylation and demethylation rates were measured in periphytic biofilms growing on submerged plants in a shallow fluvial lake located in a temperate cold region (St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Canada).

To address these issues, stable-isotope-probing coupled with metagenomics and molecular ecological network analyses were first used to investigate the phenanthrene rhizoremediation by three different prairie grasses in this study. All rhizospheres exhibited a significant increase in phenanthrene removal and markedly modified the diversity of phenanthrene degraders by increasing their populations and interactions with other microbes. Of all the active phenanthrene degraders, Marinobacter and Enterobacteriaceae dominated in the bare and switchgrass rhizosphere respectively; Achromobacter was markedly enriched in ryegrass and tall fescue rhizospheres. Metagenomes of (13) C-DNA illustrated several complete pathways of phenanthrene degradation for each rhizosphere, which clearly explained their unique rhizoremediation mechanisms. Additionally, propanoate and inositol phosphate of carbohydrates were identified as the dominant factors that drove PAH rhizoremediation by strengthening the ecological networks of soil microbial communities. This was verified by the results of rhizospheric and non-rhizospheric treatments supplemented with these two substances, further confirming their key roles in PAH removal and in situ PAH rhizoremediation.

The HCs were retrieved from a series of sediment cores from different depths. The HC δ(13)C values started to decrease with the onset of eutrophication. The HC δ(13)C temporal patterns varied among depths, which revealed spatial differences in the contribution of methanotrophic bacteria to the benthic secondary production. The estimates of the methane (CH4)-derived C contribution to chironomid biomass ranged from a few percent prior to the 1930s to up to 30 % in recent times. The chironomid fluxes increased concomitantly with changes in HC δ(13)C values before a drastic decrease due to the development of hypoxic conditions. The hypoxia reinforced the implication for CH4-derived C transfer to chironomid production. In Lake Annecy, the HC δ(13)C values were negatively correlated to total organic C (TOC) content in the sediment (Corg), whereas no relationship was found in Lake Bourget. In Lake Bourget, chironomid abundances reached their maximum with TOC contents between 1 and 1.5 % Corg, which could constitute a threshold for change in chironomid abundance and consequently for the integration of CH4-derived C into the lake food webs.

Carbon stable isotope ratios (δ(13)C) discriminate best between the two rivers, but fine scale analysis in otoliths requires rare, expensive instrumentation. We therefore correlated other tracers (SrSr, Ba, and Se in ratio to Ca) to δ(13)C that are easier to quantify in otoliths with other microchemical techniques. Although the Little Colorado River's water chemistry varies with major storm events, at base flow or near base flow (conditions occurring 84% of the time in our study) its chemistry differs sufficiently from the mainstem to discriminate one from the other.

A common dilemma in risk assessment is that monitoring data reveals contaminant concentrations in wildlife, while the source concentrations, route of uptake and acceptable source concentrations remain unsolved. To overcome this problem, different models have been developed in order to obtain more precise risk estimates for the food webs. However, there is still an urgent need for studies combining modelled and measured data in order to verify the functionality of the models. Studies utilising field-collected data covering entire food webs are particularly scarce. This study aims to contribute to tackling this problem by determining the validity of two bioaccumulation models, BIOv1.22 and AQUAWEBv1.2, for application to a multispecies aquatic food web. A small boreal lake, Lake Kernaalanjärvi, in Finland was investigated for its food web structure and concentrations of PCBs in all trophic levels. Trophic magnification factors (TMFs) were used to measure the bioaccumulation potential of PCBs, and the site-specific environmental parameters were used to compare predicted and observed concentrations. Site-specific concentrations in sediment pore water did not affect the modelling endpoints, but accurate site-specific measurements of freely dissolved concentrations in water turned out to be crucial for obtaining realistic model-predicted concentrations in biota. Numerous parameters and snapshot values affected the model performances, bringing uncertainty into the process and results, but overall, the models worked well for a small boreal lake ecosystem. We suggest that these models can be optimised for different ecosystems and can be useful tools for estimating the bioaccumulation and environmental fate of PCBs.","Animals and Arctic Regions and Environmental Health and Finland and *Food Chain and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and Humans and Lakes and Models, Biological and Plants/metabolism and Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*toxicity and Risk Assessment and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity",2014/07/01 06:00,S0048-9697(13)00801-2 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.07.033 [doi],23959220,0330500,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and DFC2HB4I0K (Polychlorinated Biphenyls)",Netherlands,© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

One sample of free range and two samples of organic eggs had δ(15)N values within the range of caged or barn laid eggs, suggesting either that these eggs were mislabeled (the hens were raised under ""battery"" or ""barn"" conditions, and not permitted to forage outside) or that there was insufficient animal protein gained by foraging to shift the δ(15)N values of their primary food source. δ(13)C values of potential food sources are discussed with respect to dietary intake and contribution to the isotopic signature of the eggs to determine mixing of C(3) and C(4) diets, although they did not elucidate laying regimen.

Here we show that a combination of food web structure and the physiology of trace element accumulation explain why some species in San Francisco Bay are threatened by a relatively low level of selenium contamination and some are not. Bivalves and crustacean zooplankton form the base of two dominant food webs in estuaries. The dominant bivalve Potamocorbula amurensis has a 10-fold slower rate constant of loss for selenium than do common crustaceans such as copepods and the mysid Neomysis mercedis (rate constant of loss, ke = 0.025, 0.155, and 0.25 d(-1), respectively). The result is much higher selenium concentrations in the bivalve than in the crustaceans. Stable isotope analyses show that this difference is propagated up the respective food webs in San Francisco Bay. Several predators of bivalves have tissue concentrations of selenium that exceed thresholds thought to be associated with teratogenesis or reproductive failure (liver Se >15 microg g(-1) dry weight). Deformities typical of selenium-induced teratogenesis were observed in one of these species. Concentrations of selenium in tissues of predators of zooplankton are less than the thresholds.

We developed millennial-scale amino acid nitrogen isotope records preserved in ancient animal remains to understand changes in food web structure and nutrient regimes in the oceanic realm of the North Pacific Ocean (NPO). Our millennial-scale isotope records of amino acids in bone collagen in a wide-ranging oceanic seabird, the Hawaiian petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis), showed that trophic level declined over time. The amino acid records do not support a broad-scale increase in nitrogen fixation in the North Pacific subtropical gyre, rejecting an earlier interpretation based on bulk and amino acid specific δ(15)N chronologies for Hawaiian deep-sea corals and bulk δ(15)N chronologies for the Hawaiian petrel.

Diet analysis indicated that there were clear ontogenetic shifts in foraging habitats and trophic position. Pelagic diet decreased and benthic diet increased with increasing fish length in bluegill, black crappie, inland silverside, and largemouth bass, whereas there was no shift for prickly sculpin or threadfin shad. Stable carbon isotope values (delta13C) were inversely related to the proportion of pelagic prey items in the diet, but there was no clear relationship with benthic foraging. There were distinct differences between pelagic and benthic prey basal delta13C values, with a range of approximately -28 per thousand in pelagic zooplankton to approximately -20 per thousand in benthic caddisflies. Profundal prey such as chironomid larvae had intermediate delta13C values of approximately -24 per thousand, reflecting the influence of pelagic detrital subsidies and suppressing the propagation of the benthic carbon isotope signal up the food chain. Fish total mercury (TotHg) concentrations varied with habitat-specific foraging, trophic position, and size; however, the relationships differed among species and ages. When controlling for the effects of species, length, and trophic position, TotHg and delta13C were positively correlated, indicating that Hg trophic transfer is linked to benthic foraging. When examined on a species-specific basis, TotHg was positively correlated with delta13C only for bluegill, largemouth bass, and threadfin shad. However, diet-based multiple regression analyses suggested that TotHg also increased with benthic foraging for inland silverside and black crappie. In both species, benthic prey items were dominated by chironomid larvae, explaining the discrepancy with delta13C. These results illustrate the importance of foraging habitat to Hg bioaccumulation and indicate that pelagic carbon can strongly subsidize the basal energy sources of benthic organisms.","Animals and California and Eutrophication and Feeding Behavior/*physiology and Fishes/*physiology and *Food Chain and Fresh Water/*chemistry and Mercury/chemistry/*metabolism and Mining and Water Pollutants, Chemical/chemistry/*metabolism",2009/06/19 09:00,10.1890/06-1476.1 [doi],19475925,9889808,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To assess the spatial and temporal distribution of Hg in the food web, young-of-the-year (YOY) spottail shiners (Notropis hudsonius) were collected in August 2005 from five sites along the Cornwall waterfront within a Hg-contaminated zone and two reference zones. The results were compared to analyses made between 1979 and 2000 by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment. Total Hg concentrations in spottail shiners from the contaminated zone were significantly higher than in reference zones, confirming previous observations. Within the contaminated zone, there were significant differences in Hg concentrations among three sites spaced about 500 m apart, consistent with a high degree of site fidelity of YOY fish and suggesting a possible internal source of Hg. Hg concentrations in spottail shiners are decreasing regionally, although year-to-year variability was high, particularly in the contaminated zone. Stable isotope analyses of spottail shiners did not reveal any differences in nitrogen isotope composition among zones that would indicate differences in food-web structure and Hg biomagnification. However, carbon sources at an upstream reference zone were not the same as within the Area of Concern. Differences in carbon isotope composition at two sites within the contaminated zone corresponded to differences in Hg concentrations, consistent with a unique internal source of Hg. The variation in Hg contamination of YOY spottail shiners over fine spatial and temporal scales provide important insights about the potential release of Hg from contaminated sediments and the role of climate in regional trends. Sessile YOY fish provide a precise indicator for demonstrating these differences and for assessing their cause.","Animals and Carbon Isotopes/metabolism and Cyprinidae/*metabolism and Environmental Monitoring and Food Chain and Mercury/*metabolism and Nitrogen Isotopes/metabolism and Ontario and Rivers and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*metabolism",2008/05/08 09:00,10.1007/s00244-007-9040-2 [doi],17909881,0357245,"0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)",United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An interesting aspect of the impact of regime shift is that alternative regimes may induce distinct shifts in energy pathways; these have been less tested than structural changes. This paper addresses this by using stable isotopes to establish the energy pathways in fish communities. We specifically focus on the impact of regime shift on changes of the energy pathways, and how the magnitude and direction of these changes affect the local community. We found that energy pathways significantly varied among the planktivorous, benthivorous, and piscivorous trophic guilds as a result of the alternative regimes. The regime shift from a clear to a turbid state altered the food web towards planktonic energy pathways and truncated food chain length, which is indicative of less ecological efficiency. This was confirmed by the adaptive foraging strategies of prevalent omnivores in the current communities.

This phenomenon, however, is poorly documented in freshwater habitats, especially where species introductions have drastically changed an ecosystem's trophic structure. In this study, we used stable isotopes to document water-to-land nutrient transport by river otters (Lontra canadensis) around Yellowstone Lake, an ecosystem recently altered by nonnative species invasions. We then investigated the effects of otter fertilization on plant growth and prevalence at latrine (scent-marking) sites and evaluated how the recent changes to the lake's food web could influence these plant responses. Values of delta15N were higher on latrines compared to non-latrine sites in five of seven sample plant taxa. Additionally, latrine grasses had higher percentage N than those from non-latrines. Foliar delta15N positively related to fecal deposition rate for some plants, indicating that increased otter scent-marking led to a rise in these N values. Logistic regression models indicated that otters selected for well-shaded latrines with access to foraging. Atypical latrines, misclassified as non-latrines by the regression models, had values of delta15N similar to correctly classified latrines, suggesting that site effects alone cannot explain elevated N values at otter latrine sites. No difference in plant diversity or percent cover of N-fixing taxa occurred between latrine and nonlatrine sites, though specific genera did differ between site types. Measurements of shoot lengths indicated increased growth of some latrine currants (Ribes sp.). In Yellowstone Lake, a twofold reduction in otter numbers could result in an even greater decline in nutrient deposition at latrines, as otters may become less social in a system with decreased prey availability.

Recent elevation of atmospheric CO2 concentration, related primarily to fossil fuel combustion, has reduced atmospheric CO2 delta13C (13C/12C), and this change in isotopic baseline has, in turn, reduced plant and animal tissue delta13C of terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Such depletion in CO2 delta13C and its effects on tissue delta13C may introduce bias into delta13C investigations, and if this variation is not controlled, may confound interpretation of results obtained from tissue samples collected over a temporal span. To control for this source of variation, we used a high-precision record of atmospheric CO2 delta13C from ice cores and direct atmospheric measurements to model modern change in CO2 delta13C. From this model, we estimated a correction factor that controls for atmospheric change; this correction reduces bias associated with changes in atmospheric isotopic baseline and facilitates comparison of tissue delta13C collected over multiple years. To exemplify the importance of accounting for atmospheric CO2 delta13C depletion, we applied the correction to a dataset of collagen delta13C obtained from mountain lion (Puma concolor) bone samples collected in California between 1893 and 1995. Before correction, in three of four ecoregions collagen delta13C decreased significantly concurrent with depletion of atmospheric CO2 delta13C (n > or = 32, P < or = 0.01). Application of the correction to collagen delta13C data removed trends from regions demonstrating significant declines, and measurement error associated with the correction did not add substantial variation to adjusted estimates.

We combine natural stable isotope methods with qPCR to investigate how denitrifier gene abundance is related to variations in nitrate (NO(3)(-)) pool sizes across diverse terrestrial biomes and conditions. We analyze NO(3)(-) isotope composition ((15)N/(14)N, (18)O/(16)O) and denitrifier gene nirS in 52 soil samples from different California ecosystems, spanning desert, chaparral, oak-woodland/savanna and forest. δ(15)N-NO(3)(-) correlates positively with δ(18)O-NO(3)(-) (P⩽0.03) and nirS abundance (P=0.00002) across sites, revealing the widespread importance of isotopic discrimination by soil denitrifiers. Furthermore, NO(3)(-) concentrations correlate negatively to nirS (P=0.002) and δ(15)N-NO(3)(-) (P=0.003) across sites. We also observe these spatial relationships in short-term (7-day), in situ soil-incubation experiments; NO(3)(-)-depletion strongly corresponds with increased nirS, nirS/16 rRNA, and enrichment of heavy NO(3)(-) isotopes over time. Overall, these findings suggest that microbial denitrification can consume plant-available NO(3)(-) to low levels at multiple time scales, contributing to N-limitation patterns across sites, particularly in moist, carbon-rich soils.

However, the contribution of terrestrial particulate organic carbon (tPOC) from annual leaf fall to lake food webs has not yet been adequately traced and quantified. In this study, we conducted whole-lake experiments to trace artificially added tPOC through the food webs of two shallow lakes of similar eutrophic status, but featuring alternative stable regimes (macrophyte rich vs. phytoplankton dominated). Lakes were divided with a curtain, and maize (Zea mays) leaves were added, as an isotopically distinct tPOC source, into one half of each lake. To estimate the balance between autochthonous carbon fixation and allochthonous carbon input, primary production and tPOC and tDOC (terrestrial dissolved organic carbon) influx were calculated for the treatment sides. We measured the stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta13C) of about 800 samples from all trophic consumer levels and compared them between lake sides, lakes, and three seasons. Leaf litter bag experiments showed that added maize leaves were processed at rates similar to those observed for leaves from shoreline plants, supporting the suitability of maize leaves as a tracer. The lake-wide carbon influx estimates confirmed that autochthonous carbon fixation by primary production was the dominant carbon source for consumers in the lakes. Nevertheless, carbon isotope values of benthic macroinvertebrates were significantly higher with maize additions compared to the reference side of each lake. Carbon isotope values of omnivorous and piscivorous fish were significantly affected by maize additions only in the macrophyte-dominated lake and delta13C of zooplankton and planktivorous fish remained unaffected in both lakes. In summary, our results experimentally demonstrate that tPOC in form of autumnal litterfall is rapidly processed during the subsequent months in the food web of shallow lakes and is channeled to secondary and tertiary consumers predominantly via the benthic pathways. A more intense processing of tPOC seems to be connected to a higher structural complexity in littoral zones, and hence may differ between shallow lakes of alternative stable states.",Animals and Carbon/chemistry/*metabolism and Carbon Isotopes and Feeding Behavior/physiology and Fishes/*metabolism and *Food Chain and Invertebrates/*metabolism and Lakes/*chemistry and Plankton/physiology and Plant Leaves/chemistry/metabolism and Seasons and Zea mays/chemistry/metabolism,2014/08/01 06:00,10.1890/13-0390.1 [doi],25039215,0043541,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 7440-44-0 (Carbon),United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

During the first 40 days of the experiment, the condition index (K(R)) of the returned A. regius and the unfed A. regius followed the same decreasing trend. Thereafter, the K(R) values of the returned A. regius were significantly higher than those of the unfed A. regius but never reached the values of well-fed A. regius. The δ¹³C signal of the returned A. regius clearly increased (in comparison with the well-fed A. regius) after they had spent a few months at liberty. The temporal pattern depicted by the stable isotopes and the most likely prey composition inferred from this pattern strongly suggest a shift in diet. The stomach contents of the returned A. regius that had spent <100 days at liberty consisted almost exclusively of decapods. The diet of the few returned A. regius that had spent >100 days at liberty consisted entirely of fishes. Wild A. regius from the remaining fishery on the Spanish coast exhibited the same ontogenetic diet shift from invertebrates to fishes, but at a smaller size threshold. Overall, the results demonstrated that culture-reared A. regius experience adverse conditions during the first days after release into the wild but that at least some A. regius are able to adapt to the natural environment after a few months at liberty.","*Adaptation, Biological and Animals and *Aquaculture and Body Size and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Diet/veterinary and Gastrointestinal Contents and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Perciformes/*physiology and Spain",2014/04/01 06:00,10.1111/jfb.12241 [doi],24383799,0214055,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),England,© 2013 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.,10.1111/jfb.12241 [doi],condition index and diet and restocking and stable isotopes and time at liberty,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We analyzed growth rates and shell geochemistry of the circumpolar Greenland smooth cockle, Serripes groenlandicus, from the southern Barents Sea over almost 70 years between 1882 and 1968. The datasets were calibrated via annually-deposited growth lines, and growth, stable isotope (delta(18)O, delta(13)C), and trace elemental (Mg, Sr, Ba, Mn) patterns were linked to environmental variations on weekly to decadal scales. Standardized growth indices revealed an oscillatory growth pattern with a multi-year periodicity, which was inversely related to the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO), and positively related to local river discharge. Up to 60% of the annual variability in Ba/Ca could be explained by variations in river discharge at the site closest to the rivers, but the relationship disappeared at a more distant location. Patterns of delta(18)O, delta(13)C, and Sr/Ca together provide evidence that bivalve growth ceases at elevated temperatures during the fall and recommences at the coldest temperatures in the early spring, with the implication that food, rather than temperature, is the primary driver of bivalve growth. The multi-proxy approach of combining the annually integrated information from the growth results and higher resolution geochemical results yielded a robust interpretation of biophysical coupling in the region over temporal and spatial scales. We thus demonstrate that sclerochronological proxies can be useful retrospective analytical tools for establishing a baseline of ecosystem variability in assessing potential combined impacts of climatic change and increasing commercial activities on Arctic communities.","Animals and Bivalvia/chemistry/growth & development/*physiology and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Environment and Environmental Monitoring/*methods and Humans and Oceans and Seas and Oxygen Isotopes/analysis and Trace Elements/analysis and Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2009/09/23 06:00,S0025-326X(09)00093-9 [pii] and 10.1016/j.marpolbul.2009.02.022 [doi],19394657,0260231,"0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Oxygen Isotopes) and 0 (Trace Elements) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",England,NA,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2009.02.022 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,P20 RR016463/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States and P20 RR016463-086202/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States and HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States and P20 RR-016463/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States,PMC2707507,NA,NA,NA,NA,NIHMS99950,NA,NA,NA

The area experiences a humid tropical climate with frequent, high-intensity rainfall (4000 mm annual average). Nevertheless, there is a shortage of water during the peak dry season immediately before the onset of monsoon because of a rapid fall in the groundwater level. From the humid high-altitude forests to the intense agriculture in the coastal area, there is an urgent need to understand the movement of water between evapotranspiration, rainfall, river systems and the groundwater compartments in order to achieve better water resource management. Demographic pressure on the area with over half a million inhabitants and industrial activity strongly influence this fragile ecosystem. The coastal area is characterized by shallow open wells, which are particularly sensitive to pollution and eutrophication. Stable water isotopes ((18)O and deuterium) were used for the first time in this region to determine the isotopic characteristics of the different waters. There is a clear seasonal difference in the isotopic ratios and d-excess values between the summer and winter monsoon periods, with a predominance of lighter isotopes in the latter period.

Here, we examined if ecological segregation among animals in relation to sex and age existed by analyzing the signatures of δ(15)N and δ(13)C in the muscle of Western Mediterranean striped dolphins. Moreover, we used a Bayesian mixing model to study diet composition and investigated potential dietary changes over the last two decades in this population. For this, we compared isotope signatures in samples of stranded dolphins obtained during two epizootic events occurring in 1990 and 2007-2008. Mean δ(13)C values for females and males were not significantly different, but age-related variation indicated δ(13)C enrichment in both sexes, suggesting that females and males most likely fed in the same general areas, increasing their consumption of benthic prey with age. Enrichment of δ(15)N was only observed in females, suggesting a preference for larger or higher trophic level prey than males, which could reflect different nutritional requirements. δ(13)C values showed no temporal variation, although the mean δ(15)N signature decreased from 1990 to 2007-2008, which could indicate a dietary shift in the striped dolphin over the last two decades. The results of SIAR indicated that in 1990, hake and sardine together contributed to 60% on the diet of immature striped dolphins, and close to 90% for mature striped dolphins. Conversely, the diet of both groups in 2007-2008 was more diverse, as hake and sardine contributed to less than 40% of the entire diet. These results suggest a dietary change that was possibly related to changes in food availability, which is consistent with the depletion of sardine stocks by fishing.",Animals and Bayes Theorem and Ecology and Environmental Monitoring and Female and *Fisheries and *Fishes and Food Chain and Gadiformes and Geography and Isotopes and Male and Mediterranean Sea and Stenella/*growth & development,2012/03/01 06:00,PONE-D-11-09094 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0024554 [doi],21935424,101285081,0 (Isotopes),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0024554 [doi] and e24554,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC3174185,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bluefish Hg concentrations were analyzed relative to fish length, prey Hg content, and ontogenetic shifts in habitat use and foraging ecology, the latter assessed using stomach content analysis (n = 711) and stable nitrogen (δ(15)N) and carbon (δ(13)C) isotope measurements (n = 360). Diet and δ(13)C analysis showed that age 0 bluefish consumed both benthic and pelagic prey (silversides, sand shrimp, planktonic crustaceans; δ(13)C = - 16.52‰), whereas age 1 + bluefish fed almost exclusively on pelagic forage fish (Atlantic menhaden, herring; δ(13)C = - 17.33‰). Bluefish total Hg concentrations were significantly correlated with length (mean Hg = 0.041 and 0.254 ppm wet wt for age 0 and age 1 + bluefish, respectively). Furthermore, Hg biomagnification rates were maximal during bluefish early life stages and decelerated over time, resulting in relatively high Hg concentrations in age 0 fish. Rapid Hg accumulation in age 0 bluefish is attributed to these individuals occupying a comparable trophic level to age 1 + bluefish (δ(15)N = 15.58 and 16.09‰; trophic level = 3.55 and 3.71 for age 0 and age 1 + bluefish, respectively), as well as juveniles having greater standardized consumption rates of Hg-contaminated prey. Finally, bluefish larger than 30 cm total length consistently had Hg levels above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency criterion of 0.3 ppm.

However, subsidies between linked habitats, such as streams and riparian zones, create potential for competition between populations which never directly interact. Evidence suggests that the abundance of riparian consumers declines after fish invasion and a subsequent increase in resource sharing of emerging insects. However, diet overlap has not been investigated. Here, we examine the trophic niche of native fish, invasive fish, and native spiders in South Africa using stable isotope analysis. We compared spider abundance and diet at upstream fishless and downstream fish sites and quantified niche overlap with invasive and native fish. Spider abundance was consistently higher at upstream fishless sites compared with paired downstream fish sites, suggesting that the fish reduced aquatic resource availability to riparian consumers. Spiders incorporated more aquatic than terrestrial insects in their diet, with aquatic insects accounting for 45-90% of spider mass. In three of four invaded trout rivers, we found that the average proportion of aquatic resources in web-building spider diet was higher at fishless sites compared to fish sites. The probability of web-building and ground spiders overlapping into the trophic niche of invasive brown and rainbow trout was as high as 26 and 51%, respectively. In contrast, the probability of spiders overlapping into the trophic niche of native fish was always less than 5%. Our results suggest that spiders share resources with invasive fish.

We conducted the first investigation of spatiotemporal trends for nine alternative halogenated flame retardants (AHFRs) and their relations with dietary variations in 128 humpback dolphins that were stranded along the northern South China Sea during 2003-2020. We detected the highest levels of seven major AHFRs in humpback dolphins compared with the results reported in cetaceans globally, indicating high AHFR contamination in coastal regions of South China. Dolphins that were stranded near urban regions generally contained higher AHFR concentrations than those that were stranded near rural areas, mirroring the environmental trends of AHFRs occurring in this area. Model-generated diet estimates suggested that humpback dolphins have reduced their consumption of high trophic-level prey in recent years, likely attributable to overfishing-induced prey decline in this region. After adjusting AHFR concentrations due to diet changes, the temporal trends of AHFR contamination in humpback dolphins were only slightly altered. Our results suggest that increasing discharges of AHFRs into the South China Sea during the 2000s and 2010s may have had a greater influence on AHFR trends in humpback dolphins than dietary shifts.","Animals and China and Conservation of Natural Resources and *Dolphins and Ecosystem and Fisheries and *Flame Retardants and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2022/04/21 06:00,10.1021/acs.est.1c08636 [doi],35394783,0213155,"0 (Flame Retardants) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",United States,NA,10.1021/acs.est.1c08636 [doi],cetaceans and diet shift and emerging flame retardants and spatial trends and stable isotopes,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) has the potential to reduce the accumulation of organic wastes in the environment by using taxa of lower trophic levels such as filter feeders. However, the capacity of filter feeders to assimilate significant quantities of fish farm wastes has not yet been fully tested in situ. We analyzed the stable isotopes δ(13)C and δ(15)N in mussels from six fish farms and from six other areas that were not influenced by fish farming, at two water strata (surface and mid-water) across a marked gradient of eutrophication along more than 900 km of coastline in the Western Mediterranean. We found that the mussels did not directly assimilate fish farming wastes. Consequently, fish farming wastes did not constitute a major component of mussel diet, irrespective of local productivity and depth in the water column. These outcomes do not necessarily mean that IMTA is not suitable in other cases, but rather that there should be a shift in the rationale of IMTA by modifying the concept of direct assimilation of wastes to a more general approach of IMTA based on regional budgets of nutrients.","Animals and *Aquaculture and *Bivalvia and Environmental Monitoring and Eutrophication and Farms and Fishes and *Waste Disposal, Fluid",2017/11/29 06:00,S0301-4797(17)30611-4 [pii] and 10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.06.029 [doi],28649010,0401664,NA,England,Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Few records of species that live beyond the continental shelves date back more than 60 y, and the sheer size of oceanic regions makes their food webs difficult to study, even in modern times. Here, we use stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes to study the foraging history of a generalist, oceanic predator, the Hawaiian petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis), which ranges broadly in the Pacific from the equator to near the Aleutian Islands. Our isotope records from modern and ancient, radiocarbon-dated bones provide evidence of over 3,000 y of dietary stasis followed by a decline of ca. 1.8‰ in δ(15)N over the past 100 y. Fishery-induced trophic decline is the most likely explanation for this sudden shift, which occurs in genetically distinct populations with disparate foraging locations. Our isotope records also show that coincident with the apparent decline in trophic level, foraging segregation among petrel populations decreased markedly. Because variation in the diet of generalist predators can reflect changing availability of their prey, a foraging shift in wide-ranging Hawaiian petrel populations suggests a relatively rapid change in the composition of oceanic food webs in the Northeast Pacific.

Juveniles were mainly located at shallower depths, but also at deepest stations in autumn, while adults mostly inhabited intermediate depths with their centre of population density (CPD) located at 800-1000 m of depth. The migration of adults to deeper depths was detected in late summer to autumn, probably linked to the occurrence of nepheloid layers at c. 1200 m, which in turn enhances the biomass of the zooplankton prey. The diet was mainly based on euphausiids and mysids, with marked seasonal variations both on the upper (450-800 m) and lower (1000-1800 m), where suprabenthic gammariids and pelagic decapods were also dominant. Stomach fullness increased from winter to autumn on the US, while it had a maximum in spring on the LS, in parallel with high consumption of gelatinous zooplankton, which is probably more available after the phytoplankton bloom in late winter. Reproduction occurred in winter, confirmed by the higher percentage of mature females and high gonadosomatic indices (I(G)) at both depth ranges. Hepatosomatic indices (I(H)) showed an inverse trend to I(G) on the US, except in autumn, and was almost parallel on the LS, probably attributable to the migration of adults, which determined different temporal schemes in energy use and storage for reproduction on the US v. LS. Consistent with the different patterns observed at the two depth ranges, environmental drivers of fullness (i.e. feeding intensity) and I(G) (as a proxy of reproductive cycle) differed on the US and LS. The biomass of mysids and euphausiids was the greatest explanatory variables of fullness on the US and LS, pointing to the increasing feeding intensity when a resource was more available. I(H) also explained fullness, suggesting that greater feeding intensity in pre-reproductive periods enabled energy storage in the liver. I(G) was linked directly (i.e. mysids) or indirectly (i.e. surface primary production recorded 2 months before sampling) to food availability, implying a rapid response to vertical food inputs by deep-sea predators. Also, I(G) in L. crocodilus was related to population density, which suggests aggregations for reproduction. Estimates of L. crocodilus trophic levels, and of other accompanying mesopelagic fishes, indicated that the species feed through a continuum spanning the third trophic level, confirming the key role of mesopelagic fishes in transferring organic carbon between trophic levels. Trophic niche segregation among mesopelagic species was pronounced and non-overlapping groups could be distinguished because of the different vertical distribution and migratory behaviour. The study highlights the important role of the benthic boundary layer in sustaining benthopelagic communities in the deep Mediterranean Sea and the need to study the biology of a species throughout its whole depth range and not just at exploited depths (i.e. fishing grounds).","Animals and Behavior, Animal and Biomass and Ecosystem and Feeding Behavior and Female and Fishes/*physiology and *Food Chain and Male and Mediterranean Sea and Population Density and *Reproduction and *Seasons",2014/07/18 06:00,10.1111/jfb.12378 [doi],24786723,0214055,NA,England,© 2014 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.,10.1111/jfb.12378 [doi],Balearic Basin and Myctophidae and biological traits and feeding habits and reproduction and stable isotope analysis,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite decades of research directed toward reducing N losses from agroecosystems, progress has been minimal, and the currently promoted best management practices are not necessarily the most effective. We investigated the fate of N additions to temperate grain agroecosystems using a meta-analysis of 217 field-scale studies that followed the stable isotope 15N in crops and soil. We compared management practices that alter inorganic fertilizer additions, such as application timing or reduced N fertilizer rates, to practices that re-couple the biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C) and N, such as organic N sources and diversified crop rotations, and analyzed the following response variables: 15N recovery in crops, total recovery of 15N in crops and soil, and crop yield. More of the literature (94%) emphasized crop recovery of 15N than total 15N recovery in crops and soil (58%), though total recovery is a more ecologically appropriate indicator for assessing N losses. Findings show wide differences in the ability of management practices to improve N use efficiency. Practices that aimed to increase crop uptake of commercial fertilizer had a lower impact on total 15N recovery (3-21% increase) than practices that re-coupled C and N cycling (30-42% increase). A majority of studies (66%) were only one growing season long, which poses a particular problem when organic N sources are used because crops recover N from these sources over several years. These short-term studies neglect significant ecological processes that occur over longer time scales. Field-scale mass balance calculations using the 15N data set show that, on average, 43 kg N x ha(-1) x yr(-1) was unaccounted for at the end of one growing season out of 114 kg N x ha(-1) x yr(-1), representing approximately 38% of the total 15N applied. This comprehensive assessment of stable-isotope research on agroecosystem N management can inform the development of policies to mitigate nonpoint source pollution. Nitrogen management practices that most effectively increase N retention are not currently being promoted and are rare on the landscape in the United States.","*Agriculture and Climate and Databases, Factual and Ecosystem and Edible Grain/*growth & development/*metabolism and Environmental Monitoring/*methods and Fertilizers and Nitrogen/*metabolism and Nitrogen Isotopes",2010/01/06 06:00,10.1890/08-1122.1 [doi],20014586,9889808,0 (Fertilizers) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and N762921K75 (Nitrogen),United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This 'release' from parasites has unstudied implications for native predators feeding on exotic prey. In particular, shifts from native to exotic prey should reduce levels of trophically transmitted parasites. We tested this hypothesis in native populations of pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) in Lake Opinicon, where fish stomach contents were studied intensively in the 1970s, prior to the appearance of exotic zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in the mid-1990s. Zebra mussels were common in stomachs of present-day pumpkinseeds, and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen confirmed their importance in long-term diets. Because historical parasite data were not available in Lake Opinicon, we also surveyed stomach contents and parasites in pumpkinseed in both Lake Opinicon and an ecologically similar, neighboring lake where zebra mussels were absent. Stomach contents of pumpkinseed in the companion lake did not differ from those of pre-invasion fish from Lake Opinicon. The companion lake, therefore, served as a surrogate ""pre-invasion"" reference to assess effects of zebra mussel consumption on parasites in pumpkinseed.

The oxygen isotopic composition of atmospheric CO₂ and water vapour (H₂Ov) provides a valuable tool for investigating the transport and cycling of carbon and water within this system. However, detailed studies on the coupling between ecosystem components and environmental drivers are sparse. Therefore, we conducted a H2 (18)O-labelling experiment to investigate the effect of drought on the speed of the link between below- and aboveground processes and its subsequent effect on C(18)OO released by leaves and soils. A custom-made chamber system, separating shoot from soil compartments, allowed separate measurements of shoot- and soil-related processes under controlled conditions. Gas exchange of oxygen stable isotopes in CO₂ and H₂Ov served as the main tool of investigation and was monitored in real time on Fagus sylvatica saplings using laser spectroscopy. H₂(18)O-labelling showed that drought caused a slower transport of water molecules from soil to shoot, which was indicated by its direct derivation from independently measured concentrations and (18)O/(16)O ratios of CO₂ and H₂Ov, respectively. Furthermore, drought reduced the (18)O equilibrium between H₂O and CO₂ at the shoot level, resulting in less-enriched C(18)OO fluxes from leaf to atmosphere compared with control plants.

Projecting the future adequacy of protected areas requires knowing major factors that drive such changes, and how readily the animals adjust to altered resources. In the Arctic, the viability of habitats for marine birds and mammals often depends on sea ice to dissipate storm waves and provide platforms for resting. However, some wind conditions (including weak winds during extreme cold) can consolidate pack ice into cover so dense that air-breathing divers are excluded from the better feeding areas. Spectacled Eiders (Somateria fischeri) winter among leads (openings) in pack ice in areas where densities of their bivalve prey are quite high. During winter 2009, however, prevailing winds created a large region of continuous ice with inadequate leads to allow access to areas of dense preferred prey. Stable isotope and fatty acid biomarkers indicated that, under these conditions, the eiders did not diversify their diet to include abundant non-bivalve taxa but did add a smaller, less preferred, bivalve species. Consistent with a computer model of eider energy balance, the body fat of adult eiders in 2009 was 33-35% lower than on the same date (19 March) in 2001 when ice conditions allowed access to higher bivalve densities. Ice cover data suggest that the eiders were mostly excluded from areas of high bivalve density from January to March in about 30% of 14 winters from 1998 to 2011. Thus, even without change in total extent of ice, shifts in prevailing winds can alter the areal density of ice to reduce access to important habitats. Because changes in wind-driven currents can also rearrange the dispersion of prey, the potential for altered wind patterns should be an important concern in projecting effects of climate change on the adequacy of marine protected areas for diving endotherms in the Arctic.",Animals and Arctic Regions and Bivalvia/*physiology and Conservation of Natural Resources/*methods and Demography and Ducks/*physiology and Seasons and Wind,2014/05/03 06:00,10.1890/13-0411.1 [doi],24689150,9889808,NA,United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We used a stable isotope mixing model to estimate vertical partitioning of soil water by the three growth forms. Grasses relied on shallow soil water (5-50 cm) and were strongly anisohydric. Ψ(pd) and Ψ(md) decreased significantly from the wet to the dry season. Trees extracted water from deeper regions of the soil profile (60-120 cm) and were isohydric. Ψ(pd) and Ψ(md) did not change from the wet to the dry season.

They showed seasonal changes in Ψ(pd) but not in Ψ(md).

Sequential measurements of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen isotope rations in hair provide a weekly record of diet and water resources. Carbon isotope ratios were well correlated with satellite-based measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the region occupied by the elephants as recorded by the global positioning system (GPS) movement record; the absolute amount of C(4) grass consumption is well correlated with the maximum value of NDVI during individual wet seasons. Changes in hydrogen isotope ratios coincided very closely in time with seasonal fluctuations in rainfall and NDVI whereas diet shifts to relatively high proportions of grass lagged seasonal increases in NDVI by approximately 2 weeks. The peak probability of conception in the population occurred approximately 3 weeks after peak grazing.

The accurate identification of OM is an essential element to achieve this goal. In our study, a novel application for quantitatively apportioning sources of eroded sedimentary OM from an eco-geomorphologic perspective was shown successfully via a coupled molecular n-alkane biomarkers and stable isotopic signatures ((13)C and (15)N) along with elemental compositions (TOC and TN) using a Bayesian mixing model (SIAR). Soil source samples were collected from different land use types (i.e., forests, grassland, cropland, and fallow) and gully, which were probably transported downstream along the steep terrain. Meanwhile, three soil profiles with a total of 90 sediment samples were also sampled in check dam. The results indicated that cropland was the main sedimentary OM source in this catchment, contributing 29.5%, whereas the forests, grassland, fallow and gully contributed 12.17%, 15.39%, 21.53% and 21.85%, respectively.

During the first hours after pulse labelling, the measured isotopic signal of soil CO(2) efflux is a combination of both physical tracer diffusion into and out of the soil as well as biological tracer release via root and microbial respiration. Neglecting physical back-diffusion can lead to misinterpretation regarding time lags between photosynthesis and soil CO(2) efflux in grassland or any ecosystem type where the above-ground plant parts cannot be labelled in gas-tight chambers separated from the soil. We studied the effects of physical (13)CO(2) tracer back-diffusion in pulse labelling experiments in grassland, focusing on the isotopic signature of soil CO(2) efflux. Having accounted for back-diffusion, the estimated time lag for first tracer appearance in soil CO(2) efflux changed from 0 to 1.81±0.56 h (mean±SD) and the time lag for maximum tracer appearance from 2.67±0.39 to 9.63±3.32 h (mean±SD). Thus, time lags were considerably longer when physical tracer diffusion was considered. Using these time lags after accounting for physical back-diffusion, high nocturnal soil CO(2) efflux rates could be related to daytime rates of gross primary productivity (R(2)=0.84). Moreover, pronounced diurnal patterns in the δ(13)C of soil CO(2) efflux were found during the decline of the tracer over 3 weeks. Possible mechanisms include diurnal changes in the relative contributions of autotrophic and heterotrophic soil respiration as well as their respective δ(13)C values.

Here, we show that the availability of phosphate can directly affect the transfer of freshly fixed N to epibionts in filamentous, diazotrophic cyanobacteria. Stable-isotope incubations coupled to single-cell analyses showed that <1% and ~15% of freshly fixed N was transferred to epibionts of Aphanizomenon and Nodularia, respectively, at phosphate scarcity during a summer bloom in the Baltic Sea. When phosphate was added, the transfer of freshly fixed N to epibionts dropped to about half for Nodularia, whereas the release from Aphanizomenon increased slightly. At the same time, the growth rate of Nodularia roughly doubled, indicating that less freshly fixed N was released and was used for biomass production instead. Phosphate scarcity and the resulting release of freshly fixed N could explain the heavy colonization of Nodularia filaments by microorganisms during summer blooms. As such, the availability of phosphate may directly affect the partitioning of fixed N(2) in colonies of diazotrophic cyanobacteria and may impact the interactions with their microbiome.",Aphanizomenon/growth & development/*metabolism and Baltic States and Ecosystem and Eutrophication and *Nitrogen Fixation and Nodularia/growth & development/*metabolism and Phosphates/*metabolism and Seasons and Seawater/chemistry/*microbiology and Single-Cell Analysis,2020/02/11 06:00,10.1038/s41396-019-0453-5 [pii] and 453 [pii] and 10.1038/s41396-019-0453-5 [doi],31249392,101301086,0 (Phosphates),England,NA,10.1038/s41396-019-0453-5 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC6794295,The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this experimental study, captive wild boar (Sus scrofa) were fed a controlled diet of corn (Zea mays), a popular and increasingly dominant food source for wild boar in the Czech Republic and elsewhere in Europe, and trophic discrimination factors for stable carbon (Δ13C) and nitrogen (Δ15N) isotopes were determined from hair samples.

We analyzed an 8-year record of stable isotope data on Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) from southern California to infer how the trophic position of this widespread invasive species changes over time as native ant species are displaced. We couple this longitudinal analysis with a biregional comparison of stable isotope data (delta(15)N) on ants from Argentina (native range) and California (introduced range) to quantify (i) how the trophic position of L. humile differs between native and introduced populations, and (ii) how relative trophic position as estimated by delta(15)N values of Argentine ants compare with those of other ants at the same site. Both long-term and biregional comparisons indicate that the Argentine ant's relative trophic position is reduced at sites with a longer history of occupation. Over the course of 8 years, the relative trophic position of L. humile remained high at the leading edge of an invasion front but declined, on average, behind the front as native ants disappeared. Relative to native populations, where L. humile is among the most carnivorous of ants, Argentine ants from California occupied lower trophic positions. These results support the hypothesis that Argentine ants shift their diet after establishment as a result of resource depletion and increasing reliance on plant-based resources, especially honeydew-producing Hemiptera. Our results demonstrate the value of long-term and biregional data in uncovering ecological effects of invasions.","Animal Migration and Animals and Ants and Behavior, Animal and California and *Ecology and Food Chain and Genetics, Population and Geography and Models, Statistical and Models, Theoretical and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and *Population Dynamics and Social Behavior and Time Factors",2008/01/16 09:00,0706903105 [pii] and 8748 [pii] and 10.1073/pnas.0706903105 [doi],18093925,7505876,0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC2409231,The authors declare no conflict of interest.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, many stream-dwelling fish species can use terrestrially-derived food resources, potentially subsidizing growth at low-productivity sites, and, because terrestrial resources have lower MeHg concentrations than aquatic resources, preventing an increase in diet-borne MeHg accumulation. We used a large-scale field study to evaluate relationships among terrestrial subsidy use, growth, and MeHg concentrations in two stream-dwelling fish species across an in-stream productivity gradient. We sampled young-of-the-year brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), potential competitors with similar foraging habits, from 20 study sites in streams in New Hampshire and Massachusetts that encompassed a wide range of aquatic prey biomass. Stable isotope analysis showed that brook trout used more terrestrial resources than Atlantic salmon. Over their first growing season, Atlantic salmon tended to grow larger than brook trout at sites with high aquatic prey biomass, but brook grew two-fold larger than Atlantic salmon at sites with low aquatic prey biomass. The MeHg concentrations of brook trout and Atlantic salmon were similar at sites with high aquatic prey biomass and the MeHg concentrations of both species increased at sites with low prey biomass and high MeHg in aquatic prey.

We provide a new approach for calculation of potential substrate transformation to microbial biomass (theoretical yield) based on Gibbs free energy and microbially available electrons. We compare estimated theoretical yields of biotechnological substrates and of chemicals of environmental concern with experimentally determined yields for validation of the presented approach. A five-compartment dynamic model is applied to simulate experiments of (13)C-labeled 2,4-D and ibuprofen turnover.

Among the environmental compartments, seawater covers most of the earth's surface and may be directly or indirectly impacted. The interaction between radionuclides and the marine compartment is therefore essential for better understanding the transfer mechanisms from the hydrosphere to the biosphere. This information allows for the evaluation of the impact on humans via our interaction with the biotope that has been largely undocumented up to now. In this report, we attempt to make a link between the speciation of heavy elements in natural seawater and their uptake by a model marine organism. More specifically, because the interaction of actinides with marine invertebrates has been poorly studied, the accumulation in a representative member of the Mediterranean coralligenous habitat, the sponge Aplysina cavernicola, was investigated and its uptake curve exposed to a radiotracer (241)Am was estimated using a high-purity Ge gamma spectrometer. But in order to go beyond the phenomenological accumulation rate, the speciation of americium(III) in seawater must be assessed. The speciation of (241)Am (and natural europium as its chemically stable surrogate) in seawater was determined using a combination of different techniques: Time-Resolved Laser-Induced Fluorescence (TRLIF), Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) at the LIII edge, Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and the resulting data were compared with the speciation modeling. In seawater, the americium(III) complex (as well as the corresponding europium complex, although with conformational differences) was identified as a ternary sodium biscarbonato complex, whose formula can be tentatively written as NaAm(CO3)2·nH2O. It is therefore this chemical form of americium that is accumulated by the sponge A. cavernicola.","Americium/*chemistry/*pharmacokinetics and Animals and Europium/chemistry/pharmacokinetics and Porifera/*metabolism and Seawater/*chemistry and Water Pollutants, Radioactive/*chemistry/*pharmacokinetics",2016/09/13 06:00,10.1039/c5dt02805a [doi],26556307,101176026,"0 (Water Pollutants, Radioactive) and 444W947O8O (Europium) and VW92PHU2UY (Americium)",England,NA,10.1039/c5dt02805a [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

At least 17 species ranging from 11 to 160 kg have become extinct during the past 2000 years. The effect of this loss on contemporary lemurs is unknown. The concept of competitive release favours the expansion of living species into vacant niches. Alternatively, factors that triggered the extinction of some species could have also reduced community-wide niche breadth. Here, we use radiocarbon and stable isotope data to examine temporal shifts in the niches of extant lemur species following the extinction of eight large-bodied species. We focus on southwestern Madagascar and report profound isotopic shifts, both from the time when now-extinct lemurs abounded and from the time immediately following their decline to the present. Unexpectedly, the past environments exploited by lemurs were drier than the protected (albeit often degraded) riparian habitats assumed to be ideal for lemurs today.

In this study, the fate of EXLYM in aqueous solutions was investigated using experimental and theoretical approaches. Laboratory-scale experiments showed that EXLYM is hydrolytically stable. Microbial processes are primarily responsible for the oxidation of sulfur in aqueous solutions. Under simulated sunlight, the t(1/2) values of EXLYM in acidic, neutral, and alkaline buffer solutions were 5.02, 3.83, and 5.55 h, respectively. Six TPs were identified using a non-target screening strategy realized by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q-Exactive Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry and (18)O-labeling experiments. Four of these were unambiguously confirmed using authentic standards. Reactive oxygen species scavenging experiments, (18)O-labeling experiments, and quantum-theoretical calculations suggested that EXLYM could degrade mainly through four pathways: sulfur oxidation, nucleophilic aromatic photosubstitution, C-S bond cleavage, and oxidative ring-opening.

This process can have important consequences on the fate of SOM and on the management of residues in agricultural soils, especially in tropical regions where soil fertility is essentially based on the management of organic matter. Earthworms are ecosystem engineers known to affect the dynamics of SOM. Endogeic earthworms ingest large amounts of soil and assimilate a part of organic matter it contains. During gut transit, microorganisms are transported to new substrates and their activity is stimulated by (i) the production of readily assimilable organic matter (mucus) and (ii) the possible presence of fresh organic residues in the ingested soil. The objective of our study was to see (i) whether earthworms impact the PE intensity when a fresh residue is added to a tropical soil and (ii) whether this impact is linked to a stimulation/inhibition of bacterial taxa, and which taxa are affected.

Dietary analysis of brown bears revealed that salmon consumption by bears in the eastern region of Hokkaido significantly decreased from 19% to 8%. In addition, consumption of terrestrial animals decreased from 56% to 5% in western region, and 64% to 8% in eastern region. These dietary shifts are likely to have occurred in the last approximately 100-200 years, which coincides with the beginning of modernisation in this region. Our results suggest that human activities have caused an alteration in the trophic structure of brown bears in the Hokkaido islands.

These models include those transfer processes (soil-to-plant transfer factor(s) [TF], plant-to-animal transfer coefficient(s) [TC] and concentration ratio [CR]) that are likely to be important for radiological assessment. The range of variability for transfer factors for the same plant groups is great, about 4-5 orders of magnitude, which limits their applicability. A better way to determine the best estimate the factors for radiocaesium and other important radionuclides is if the site-specific data are available. Soil, plant and animal samples were collected from a pasture area in Hungary during the vegetation period in 2016. Stable (133)Cs concentration was analysed by comparative method with neutron activation analysis (NAA). The comparator and the samples were irradiated in thermal neutron flux 2.55 × 10(12) ncm(-2)s(-1) for 2 h (soil) and 6 h (vegetation, animal samples) in the TRIGA Mark II research reactor at the Nuclear Engineering Teaching Laboratory. After an appropriate decay time (12 days) the samples were measured by gamma-spectrometry and analysed. The observed stable caesium TC(pm) (0.48-0.53) and CR(pm) (0.41-0.45) were very close to (137)Cs factors in the IAEA 2009 Report of 0.49 and 0.54, respectively. This methodology is particularly suitable for the simultaneous study of natural caesium in ecosystem compartments. Consequently, the transfer of stable caesium in a pasture field may be regarded as a useful analogy in predicting the long-term changes of (137)Cs affected by site-specific environmental factors.","Cesium Radioisotopes/*analysis and Hungary and *Neutron Activation Analysis and *Radiation Monitoring and Radioactive Fallout/analysis and Soil Pollutants, Radioactive/*analysis and Transfer Factor",2018/03/17 06:00,S0265-931X(17)30543-X [pii] and 10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.02.010 [doi],29477642,8508119,"0 (Cesium Radioisotopes) and 0 (Radioactive Fallout) and 0 (Soil Pollutants, Radioactive) and 0 (Transfer Factor)",England,Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Ecologically and physiologically meaningful biochemical tracers provide a means to characterize and quantify these transfers within food webs. In this study, changes in the ratios of stable N isotopes (e.g., delta(15)N), fatty acids (FA), and persistent contaminants were used to trace food web pathways utilized by herring gulls (Larus argentatus) breeding along the shores of the St Lawrence River, Canada. Egg delta(15)N values varied significantly among years and were used as an indicator of gull trophic position. Temporal trends in egg delta(15)N values were related to egg FA profiles. In years when egg delta(15)N values were greater, egg FA patterns reflected the consumption of more aquatic prey. Egg delta(15)N values were also correlated with annual estimates of prey fish abundance. These results indicated that temporal changes in aquatic prey availability were reflected in the gull diet (as inferred from ecological tracer profiles in gull eggs). Analysis of individual eggs within years confirmed that birds consuming more aquatic prey occupied higher trophic positions. Furthermore, increases in trophic position were associated with increased concentrations of most persistent organic contaminants in eggs. However, levels of highly brominated polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners, e.g, 2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'-decabromoDE (BDE-209), showed a negative relationship with trophic position. These contrasting findings reflected differences among contaminant groups/homologs in terms of their predominant routes of transfer, i.e., aquatic versus terrestrial food webs. High trophic level omnivores, e.g., herring gulls, are common in food webs.

The dynamic simulation of reversible AOM by ANME coupled with SR by DSS was performed. This simulation took into account biomass growth and fractionation of stable isotopes of sulfur. Two kinetic schemes with and without ANME + DSS consortium formation were tested. The respective models were applied at five influent methane concentrations. A good fit to experimental data was obtained only when assuming active ANME and DSS biomass accumulation. The assumption about incorporation of reversibility of anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfate reduction did not improve the model's fit to experimental data. In accordance with both the models, sulfur isotope fractionation was smallest for the highest influent methane concentration. The model considering the formation of consortia of ANME + DSS is proved to be more appropriate.","Anaerobiosis and Archaea and *Biodegradation, Environmental and Geologic Sediments and Isotopes and Methane/*metabolism and *Microbial Consortia and Oxidation-Reduction and Sulfates/metabolism",2019/09/07 06:00,10.2166/wst.2019.201 [doi],31318343,9879497,0 (Isotopes) and 0 (Sulfates) and OP0UW79H66 (Methane),England,NA,10.2166/wst.2019.201 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We investigated relationships between aquatic resource utilization and contaminant exposure for a riparian invertivore assemblage (spiders and herptiles) along a stream contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Stable carbon (delta13C) and nitrogen (delta15N) isotopes indicated that aquatic insect utilization varied among predators, with progressive enrichment of delta13C and depletion of delta15N as predators shifted from aquatic to terrestrial prey. PCB concentrations significantly increased along these isotopic gradients; delta13C and delta15N explained 65% and 15% of the variance in predator sigmaPCBs, respectively. PCBs in predators were high, exceeding 2000 ng/g wet mass (the human-health advisory prohibiting any consumption of fish tissue) in three species. Greater consideration should be given to streams as lateral exporters rather than simply as longitudinal conduits for contaminants. Persistent contaminants are underutilized for addressing landscape-level questions in subsidy research, but our results demonstrate they are an ideal in situ tracer of stream-derived energy because they label stream organic matter and invertebrates over large distances. Likewise, riparian predators such as tetragnathid spiders have great potential as biological monitors of stream condition and as an assessment tool for risk management of contaminated aquatic sediments.","Animals and Carbon Isotopes and Environmental Monitoring and *Food Chain and Geologic Sediments/chemistry and Insecta/*metabolism and Nitrogen Isotopes and Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis/*metabolism and Rivers/*chemistry and Spiders/*metabolism and Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/*metabolism",2009/04/01 09:00,10.1890/08-0354.1 [doi],19263881,9889808,"0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and DFC2HB4I0K (Polychlorinated Biphenyls)",United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

By measuring (15)N enrichment over time, we were able to measure the increase of tamoxifen content in algae. This enrichment was measured by an elemental analyser coupled with an isotopic ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS). Algal cells were exposed for 7d to 3 concentrations of tamoxifen: 1, 10 and 100μgL(-1). Our result shows a high bioconcentration in algae from the first minutes of contact. The highest bioconcentration factor measured is around 26500. We also observe that bioconcentration is not linked to the exposure concentration.

Comparisons using large primary consumers, which have stable tissue isotopic signatures because of their slower nitrogen turnover, show that delta(15)N increases markedly with the human population density in the lake watershed. This shift in delta(15)N likely reflects the high delta(15)N of human sewage.

Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain this replacement, one of them being the ability of anatomically modern humans to broaden their dietary spectrum beyond the large ungulate prey that Neanderthals consumed exclusively. This scenario is notably based on higher nitrogen-15 amounts in early Upper Palaeolithic anatomically modern human bone collagen compared with late Neanderthals. In this paper, we document a clear increase of nitrogen-15 in bone collagen of terrestrial herbivores during the early Aurignacian associated with anatomically modern humans compared with the stratigraphically older Châtelperronian and late Mousterian fauna associated with Neanderthals. Carnivores such as wolves also exhibit a significant increase in nitrogen-15, which is similar to that documented for early anatomically modern humans compared with Neanderthals in Europe. A shift in nitrogen-15 at the base of the terrestrial foodweb is responsible for such a pattern, with a preserved foodweb structure before and after the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in south-western France. Such an isotopic shift in the terrestrial ecosystem may be due to an increase in aridity during the time of deposition of the early Aurignacian layers. If it occurred across Europe, such a shift in nitrogen-15 in terrestrial foodwebs would be enough to explain the observed isotopic trend between late Neanderthals and early anatomically modern humans, without any significant change in the diet composition at the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition.",Animals and *Archaeology and Bone and Bones/chemistry and Climate and Collagen/chemistry and *Diet and *Environment and *Food Chain and France and Humans and Mammals/*physiology and Neanderthals/physiology and Nitrogen Isotopes/metabolism,2014/12/15 06:00,S0047-2484(14)00019-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.jhevol.2013.12.015 [doi],24630359,0337330,0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 9007-34-5 (Collagen),England,Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

But by the 1940s, an upward trend towards recovery was apparent and continued to their current stable population levels. These dramatic fluctuations in kite numbers may have been related to changes in rodent prey populations due to the conversion of native habitats to agriculture. To address this question, we evaluated the use of stable isotope analysis in determining if a shift in diet could be isotopically differentiated in current and historic kite populations. We first compared delta13C, delta15N, and delta34S values from present-day kite flight feathers and prey fur samples from four locations in California. The total ranges of isotope values for kite and their rodent prey were similar within each site. Carbon isotope values ranged from -27.1 to -22.2 per thousand in Arcata, -26.1 to -16.9 per thousand in Davis, -27.0 to -15.0 per thousand in Cosumnes, and -28.2 to -11.6 per thousand in Santa Barbara. Nitrogen isotope values ranged from 3.2 to 15.7 per thousand in Arcata, 2.8 to 12.7 per thousand in Davis, 4.0 to 15.7 per thousand in Cosumnes, and 1.7 to 20.0 per thousand in Santa Barbara. Sulfur isotope values ranged from -7.8 to 12.4 per thousand in Arcata, -1.1 to 9.2 per thousand in Davis, 0.7 to 10.9 per thousand in Cosumnes, and -8.6 to 15.6 per thousand in Santa Barbara. Carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur isotope values at each site reflect typical trophic enrichments due to physiological processes.

We further determined whether diphenhydramine accumulation differed among size classes of striped mullet over a two year study period. Stable isotope analysis identified that ontogenetic feeding shifts of M. cephalus occurred from juveniles to adults. However, bioaccumulation of diphenhydramine did not significantly increase across age classes of M. cephalus but corresponded to surface water levels of the pharmaceutical, which suggests inhalational uptake to diphenhydramine was more important for bioaccumulation than dietary exposure in this urban estuary.","Animals and Diet and Diphenhydramine/*metabolism and *Environmental Monitoring and *Estuaries and Smegmamorpha/*metabolism and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*metabolism",2017/06/24 06:00,S0141-1136(16)30355-5 [pii] and 10.1016/j.marenvres.2017.03.006 [doi],28365158,9882895,"0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and 8GTS82S83M (Diphenhydramine)",England,Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Complete defaunation or decreasing density of less-tolerant taxa occurred under hypoxia during warmer months, especially at subtidal or sulfidic stations; this was followed by rapid recolonization by opportunistic polychaetes in fall-winter. Sedimentary H2S increased the mortality of macroinvertebrates under hypoxia or delayed population recovery during recolonization. The density of several polychaetes (e.g., Pseudopolydora reticulata) declined in winter, coincident with immigration of the predator Armandia lanceolata. This suggests that absence of A. lanceolata under moderate hypoxia enabled the proliferation of prey taxa.

Four months after the tracer application, the total (15)N recovery from the major ecosystem compartments ranged from 55.3% to 90.5%. The total (15)N recoveries were similar under the ((15)NH4)2SO4 tracer treatment in both two forest ecosystems, whereas the total (15)N recovery was significantly lower in the subtropical forest ecosystem at DHS than in the boreal forest ecosystem at DXAL under the K(15)NO3 tracer treatment.

The main objective of this study was to use stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon to determine if dietary changes affected mercury (Hg) and zinc (Zn) accumulation in yellow perch ranging in size from approximately 5 cm to 27 cm. Results showed that Hg bioaccumulation generally increased with increasing trophic level in fish feeding at higher trophic levels, however, the relationship between Hg levels and δ(15)N was non-linear showing no relationship in small fish (less than 15 cm). In contrast, there was a negative, linear relationship between δ(15)N and Zn, suggesting that as perch fed at progressively higher trophic levels, less of Zn bioaccumulated.

Mercury concentrations in hair were inversely correlated to delta13C in hair and blood, suggesting that polar bears with greater total Hg concentrations fed more on pelagic prey, such as ringed seals or beluga whale, than on benthic prey.

Ecological data spanning centuries to millennia provide important contextual information for long-term management strategies, especially for species that now are living in relict populations. Here we use a variety of methods to reconstruct bald eagle diets and local abundance of their potential prey on the Channel Islands from the late Pleistocene to the time when the last breeding pairs disappeared from the islands in the mid-20th century. Faunal and isotopic analysis of bald eagles shows that seabirds were important prey for immature/adult eagles for millennia before the eagles' local extirpation. In historic times (A.D. 1850-1950), however, isotopic and faunal data show that breeding bald eagles provisioned their chicks with introduced ungulates (e.g., sheep), which were locally present in high densities. Today, bald eagles are the focus of an extensive conservation program designed to restore a stable breeding population to the Channel Islands, but native and nonnative prey sources that were important for bald eagles in the past are either diminished (e.g., seabirds) or have been eradicated (e.g., introduced ungulates). In the absence of sufficient resources, a growing bald eagle population on the Channel Islands could expand its prey base to include carrion from local pinniped colonies, exert predation pressure on a recovering seabird population, and possibly prey on endangered island foxes.","Analysis of Variance and Animals and Birds and Bone and Bones/chemistry and California and Caniformia and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Conservation of Natural Resources/*methods and *Diet and Eagles/*physiology and Feathers/chemistry and *Food Chain and Geography and History, 19th Century and History, 20th Century and History, Ancient and Keratins/analysis and Mass Spectrometry and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Population Dynamics and Sheep",2010/07/23 06:00,0913011107 [pii] and 200913011 [pii] and 10.1073/pnas.0913011107 [doi],20439737,7505876,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and 68238-35-7 (Keratins),United States,NA,10.1073/pnas.0913011107 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC2889061,The authors declare no conflict of interest.,NA,NA,NA,NA,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Feb 22;108(8):E25; author reply E26.

To evaluate the risk of dispersion and accumulation of ³⁶Cl in the biosphere as a consequence of a potential contamination, there is a need for an appropriate understanding of the chlorine cycling dynamics in the ecosystems. To date, a small number of studies have investigated the chlorine transfer in the ecosystem including the transformation of chloride to organic chlorine but, to our knowledge, none have modelled this cycle. In this study, a model involving inorganic as well as organic pools in soils has been developed and parameterised to describe the biogeochemical fate of chlorine in a pine forest. The model has been evaluated for stable chlorine by performing a range of sensitivity analyses and by comparing the simulated to the observed values. Finally a range of contamination scenarios, which differ in terms of external supply, exposure time and source, has been simulated to estimate the possible accumulation of ³⁶Cl within the different compartments of the coniferous stand. The sensitivity study supports the relevancy of the model and its compartments, and has highlighted the chlorine transfers affecting the most the residence time of chlorine in the stand. Compared to observations, the model simulates realistic values for the chlorine content within the different forest compartments. For both atmospheric and underground contamination scenarios most of the chlorine can be found in its organic form in the soil. However, in case of an underground source, about two times less chlorine accumulates in the system and proportionally more chlorine leaves the system through drainage than through volatilisation.","Chlorine/*analysis and Environmental Monitoring and Radioisotopes/*analysis and Soil Pollutants, Radioactive/*analysis and Tracheophyta/*chemistry",2012/06/12 06:00,S0265-931X(11)00309-2 [pii] and 10.1016/j.jenvrad.2011.12.014 [doi],22370653,8508119,"0 (Radioisotopes) and 0 (Soil Pollutants, Radioactive) and 4R7X1O2820 (Chlorine)",England,Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To further understand the trophodynamics of Cr, As and cobalt (Co), we investigated concentrations and transfer throughout the food web in each basin of Lake Moreno. Each basin differs in morphology in that the gently-sloping Lake Moreno West has more littoral habitat than deeper Lake Moreno East with its higher proportion of pelagic habitat. Despite the morphological differences, both basins share similar water quality parameters and species assemblages. As a result, Lake Moreno provides an exceptional opportunity to compare trophodynamics of elements that enable us to hypothesize pelagic-littoral habitat coupling in response to lake morphology as the underlying factor influencing both Cr pathway and Co and As trophodynamic modeling. Using stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ¹⁵N) and carbon (δ¹³C) to characterize metals trophodynamics in each basin, biodilution of As, Cr and Co were indicated by negative regressions. This is confirmed by elevated As, Co and Cr concentrations in phytoplankton (11.3±5.7, 7.4±4.9, 44.5±40.7 μg g⁻¹ DW respectively), while zooplankton and biofilm had the next elevated concentrations. Those elevated concentrations are in contrast with lower concentrations in sport fish such as rainbow trout (0.5±0.5, 0.2±0.3, 1.8±1.2 μg g⁻¹ DW). Higher concentrations of Cr in fish were associated with higher proportion of benthic/littoral prey items in western basin, and were confirmed by significant correlation with δ¹³C values.

Given their opportunistic, omnivorous nature the consumptive and competitive impacts of house mice on islands have the potential to vary over time in concert with resource availability and mouse population dynamics. METHODS: We examined the ecological niche of invasive house mice on Southeast Farallon Island, California, USA using a combination of mouse trapping, food resource surveys, and stable isotope analysis to better understand their trophic interactions with native flora and fauna. Specifically, we coupled the analysis of seasonal variation in resource availability over a 17-year period (2001-2017), carbon (δ (13)C) and nitrogen (δ (15)N) stable isotope values of mouse tissue and prey resources in a single year (2013), and isotopic niche and mixing models to quantify seasonal variation in mouse diets and the potential for resource overlap with native species. RESULTS: We found that plants were the most important resource for house mice during the spring months when vegetation is abundant and mouse populations are low following heavy precipitation and declines in mouse abundance during the winter. While still consumed, plants declined in dietary importance throughout the summer and fall as mouse populations increased, and seabird and arthropod resources became relatively more available and consumed by house mice. Mouse abundance peaks and other resource availability are low on the island in the fall months when the isotopic niches of house mice and salamanders overlap significantly indicating the potential for competition, most likely for arthropod prey. DISCUSSION: Our results indicate how seasonal shifts in both mouse abundance and resource availability are key factors that mediate the consumptive and competitive impacts of introduced house mice on this island ecosystem. As mice consume and/or compete with a wide range of native taxa, eradication has the potential to provide wide-reaching restoration benefits on Southeast Farallon Island. Post-eradication monitoring focused on plant, terrestrial invertebrate, salamander, and seabird populations will be crucial to confirm these predictions.",Animals and Mice and *Ecosystem and Seasons and Invertebrates and Nutritional Status and Plants and *Arthropods and Population Dynamics,2022/09/29 06:01,13904 [pii] and 10.7717/peerj.13904 [doi],36168433,101603425,NA,United States,©2022 Polito et al.,10.7717/peerj.13904 [doi] and e13904,Diet and Invasive species and Island ecology and Rodents and Seabirds and Seasonality and Stable isotope analysis,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,PMC9509673,The authors declare there are no competing interests.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The study investigated specifically the potential BFR biomagnification in a particular lake's pelagic food web, whose structure and dynamics were evaluated using the Stable Isotope Analysis. The potential BFR biomagnification was investigated by using the trophic-level adjusted BMFs and Trophic Magnification Factors (TMFs), confirming that HBCD and some PBDE congeners are able to biomagnify within food webs. Comparing the calculated values of BMFTL and TMF, a significant positive correlation was observed between the two factors, suggesting that the use of BMFTL to investigate the biomagnification potential of organic chemical compounds might be an appropriate approach when a simple food web is considered.","Animals and Bromobenzenes/analysis/metabolism and *Environmental Monitoring and Fishes/metabolism and Flame Retardants/analysis/*metabolism and Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers/analysis/*metabolism and Hydrocarbons, Brominated/analysis/*metabolism and Italy and Lakes/chemistry and Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/*metabolism and Zooplankton/metabolism",2014/10/07 06:00,S0048-9697(14)00237-X [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.02.063 [doi],24614155,0330500,"0 (Bromobenzenes) and 0 (Flame Retardants) and 0 (Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers) and 0 (Hydrocarbons, Brominated) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical) and 0 (decabromodiphenyl ethane) and T01859XWIR (hexabromobenzene)",Netherlands,Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

PFOS, multiple long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids [perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA)] and perfluorooctane sulfonamide precursors were estimated to bioaccumulate from air to tree swallows.

Recent discoveries have expanded the known ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes from the domain Bacteria to Archaea. However, in the complex soil environment it remains unclear whether ammonia oxidation is exclusively or predominantly linked to Archaea as implied by their exceptionally high abundance. Here we show that Bacteria rather than Archaea functionally dominate ammonia oxidation in an agricultural soil, despite the fact that archaeal versus bacterial amoA genes are numerically more dominant. In soil microcosms, in which ammonia oxidation was stimulated by ammonium and inhibited by acetylene, activity change was paralleled by abundance change of bacterial but not of archaeal amoA gene copy numbers. Molecular fingerprinting of amoA genes also coupled ammonia oxidation activity with bacterial but not archaeal amoA gene patterns.

Beyond direct consumption, predators can affect communities indirectly by creating or altering food web linkages among existing species. Where invasive predators consume prey from multiple distinct resource channels, novel links may couple the dynamics of disjunct modules and create indirect interactions between them. Our study focuses on invasive populations of Eleutherodactylus coqui (Anura: Leptodactylidae) on Hawaii Island. Coqui actively forage in the understory and lower canopy at night but return to the forest floor and belowground retreats by day. Recent dietary studies using gut contents and naturally occurring stable isotopes indicate higher than expected consumption of litter arthropods, which in these Hawaiian forests are primarily non-native species. We used laboratory studies to observe diurnal and nocturnal foraging behavior, and experimental field additions of C4 vegetation as a litter tracer to distinguish epigaeic sources from food web pools in the C3 canopy. Lab trials revealed that prey consumption during diurnal foraging was half that consumed during nocturnal foraging. Analysis of δ13C isotopes showed incorporation of C4 carbon into litter arthropods within one month, and Bayesian mixing models estimated that 15-25% of the carbon in coqui tissue was derived from litter sources. These results support recent findings that E. coqui are not quiescent diurnally but instead actively forage. Such activity by a mobile invasive predator may introduce a novel linkage that integrates detrital and foliar resource pools, potentially distributing influences of invasive litter arthropods through the broader system to amplify impacts on native species.","Amphipoda/metabolism and Animal Distribution and Animals and Ants/metabolism and Anura/metabolism and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and *Diet and Feeding Behavior and Food Chain and Hawaii and *Introduced Species and Models, Biological and Photoperiod and *Predatory Behavior",2019/02/05 06:00,PONE-D-18-07167 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0201883 [doi],30110360,101285081,0 (Carbon Isotopes),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0201883 [doi] and e0201883,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC6093679,The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Foraging on refuse during the rearing period could affect the acquisition of resources with potential demographic consequences. Using conventional diet analysis and stable isotopes of δ(13)C and δ(15)N of blood of Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) nestlings, we studied the variation of the chick growth in response to foraging on refuse on a reproductive colony in the Rio de la Plata Estuary in Uruguay. Using Bayesian mixing models on isotopic data, we estimated the proportion and variation of natural food and refuse in the diet of nestlings. Then, we modelled the variation between the mean posterior densities of the food sources and their standard deviation with the nestling morphometric measurements of different sizes. We found that refuse was gradually delivered to Kelp Gull nestlings during the chick rearing period. Additionally, variation of refuse incorporated into nestling tissues increased with nestlings' size. We propose that parents use more isotopically unique food sources during the nestling growth thereby increasing isotopic diversity. This study highlights the need to improve the current waste management system, which is being reviewed in Uruguay.

Using results from laboratory diet manipulations and monthly sampling of field populations, we illustrate how nitrogen isotopes may be used to quantify spatio-temporal variation in resource assimilation in ants. First, we determined nitrogen enrichment using a controlled laboratory experiment with the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). After 12 weeks, worker δ(15)N values from colonies fed an animal-based diet had δ(15)N values that were 5.51% greater compared to colonies fed a plant-based diet. The shift in δ(15)N values in response to the experimental diet occurred within 10 weeks. We next reared Argentine ant colonies with or without access to honeydew-producing aphids and found that after 8 weeks workers from colonies without access to aphids had δ(15)N values that were 6.31% larger compared to colonies with access to honeydew. Second, we sampled field populations over a 1-year period to quantify spatio-temporal variability in isotopic ratios of L. humile and those of a common native ant (Solenopsis xyloni). Samples from free-living colonies revealed that fluctuations in δ(15)N were 1.6-2.4‰ for L. humile and 1.8-2.9‰ for S. xyloni. Variation was also detected among L. humile castes: time averaged means of δ(15)N varied from 1.2 to 2.5‰ depending on the site, with δ(15)N values for queens ≥ workers > brood. The estimated trophic positions of L. humile and S. xyloni were similar within a site; however, trophic position for each species differed significantly at larger spatial scales. While stable isotopes are clearly useful for examining the trophic ecology of arthropod communities, our results suggest that caution is warranted when making ecological interpretations when stable isotope collections come from single time periods or life stages.",Animals and Ants/*physiology and Feeding Behavior and *Food Chain and Introduced Species and Nitrogen Isotopes,2011/02/01 06:00,1694 [pii] and 10.1007/s00442-010-1694-1 [doi],20577762,0150372,0 (Nitrogen Isotopes),Germany,NA,10.1007/s00442-010-1694-1 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC2955918,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Element concentrations were determined in muscle and liver tissue in kittiwakes collected in May, July and October 2007.

Mercury concentrations declined from May through July to October in both tissues, while concentrations of Cd were similar in May and July and lower in October. A decline in TP between May and July, indicating a shift from fish-based diet towards an invertebrate-based diet explains the declining Hg concentration. The low Hg and Cd concentrations in October may be a result of an increased elimination, probably related to moulting. Selenium decreased in the same manner as Hg in liver and muscle, possibly related to the formation of Se-Hg complexes. Zinc and Cu did not fluctuate in muscle tissue, whereas hepatic Zn concentrations where highest in May.

The invasion of the Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) into these lakes has changed several facets of black bass biology, but there is still much to learn about the relationship between these species. Previous dietary analyses have shown Round Goby to be important prey for bass, but have been limited by low visual identification rates of dissected stomach items. Within the present study, DNA barcoding and stable isotope analysis improve prey identification and provide a more quantitative dietary analysis of adult black bass in Lake Ontario, comparing the importance of Round Goby as prey between these two species. Eighty-four LMB (406mm fork length ±4mm SEM) and two hundred sixty-four SMB (422mm ±2mm) obtained as tournament mortalities had prey identified using DNA-based methods. Round Goby was the most prevalent prey species for both predators. The diet of LMB was three times more diverse than that of SMB, which almost entirely consists of Round Goby. Our results provide further support that recent increases in the size of Lake Ontario bass are a result of Round Goby consumption, and that the effects of this dietary shift on body condition are greater for SMB. Techniques developed in this study include reverse-oriented dual priming oligonucleotides used as blocking primers for predator DNA, and an automated design approach of restriction fragment length polymorphism tests for identifying prey DNA barcodes.","Animals and DNA/*analysis and DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic/*methods and Diet/*veterinary and Food Analysis/*methods and Isotope Labeling/*methods and Perciformes/*physiology",2017/10/07 06:00,PONE-D-16-39912 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0181914 [doi],28771612,101285081,9007-49-2 (DNA),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0181914 [doi] and e0181914,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC5542617,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We need to expand our insight between the feeding guilds of fauna and not just count biodiversity. The soil fauna drive nutrient cycling and play a pivotal, but little understood role within both the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles that may be ecosystem dependent. Here, we define the structure of the SFW in two habitats (grassland and woodland) on the same soil type and test the hypothesis that land management would alter the SFW in these habitats. To do this, we census the community structure and use stable isotope analysis to establish the pathway of C and N through each trophic level within the ecosystems. Stable isotope ratios of C and N from all invertebrates were used as a proxy for trophic niche, and community-wide metrics were obtained. Our empirically derived C/N ratios differed from those previously reported, diverging from model predictions of global C and N cycling, which was unexpected. An assessment of the relative response of the different functional groups to the change from agricultural grassland to woodland was performed.

Stable carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotope values provide useful information into the study of animal ecology and evolution, since the isotope ratios of consumers reflect consumer's dietary patterns. Nevertheless, the lack of species- and element-specific laboratory-derived turnover rates could limit their application. Using a laboratory-based dual stable isotope tracer approach (Na(15) NO (3) and NaH(13) CO (3)), we evaluated the δ(15)N and δ(13)C isotope turnover rates in full-grown adult invasive Limnomysis benedeni from Lake Constance. We provide δ(15)N and δ(13)C turnover rates based on nonlinear least-squares regression and posterior linear regression models. Model precisions and fit were evaluated using Akaike's information criterion. Within a couple of days, the δ(15)N and δ(13)C of mysids began to change. Nevertheless, after about 14 days, L. benedeni did not reach equilibrium with their new isotope values. Since the experiment was conducted on adult subjects, it is evident that turnover was mainly influenced by metabolism (in contrast to growth). Unlike traditional dietary shifts, our laboratory-based dual stable isotope tracer approach does not shift the experimental organisms into a new diet and avoids dietary effects on isotope values. Results confirm the application of isotopic tracers to label mysid subpopulations and could be used to reflect assimilation and turnover from the labeled dietary sources. Field-based stable isotope studies often use isotopic mixing models commonly assuming diet-tissue steady state. Unfortunately, in cases where the isotopic composition of the animal is not in equilibrium with its diet, this can lead to highly misleading conclusions. Thus, our laboratory-based isotopic incorporation rates assist interpretation of the isotopic values from the field and provide a foundation for future research into using isotopic tracers to investigate invasion ecology.",NA,2017/06/27 06:01,ECE32928 [pii] and 10.1002/ece3.2928 [doi],28649330,101566408,NA,England,NA,10.1002/ece3.2928 [doi],Na15NO3 and NaH13CO3 and stable isotope and δ13C and δ15N,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,PMC5478064,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the current study, stable isotope probing was used to characterize acetate- and lactate-oxidizing bacteria in thermophilic anaerobic digestion. In microcosms fed (13)C-acetate, bacteria related to members of Clostridium, Hydrogenophaga, Fervidobacterium, Spirochaeta, Limnohabitans, and Rhodococcus demonstrated elevated abundances of (13)C-DNA fractions, suggesting their activities in acetate oxidation.

This study assessed the bioaccumulation of mercury (total mercury, THg) in the muscle, liver, red blood cells (RBC), and plasma of pelagic and bigeye thresher sharks (Alopias pelagicus and A. superciliosus) from eastern tropical Pacific. Additionally, the concentration of methylmercury (MeHg) in muscle was also determined to assess risks for human consumption. For both species, muscle THg concentrations (4.05 ± 2.15 and 4.12 ± 1.84 μg g(-1) dry weight for pelagic and bigeye thresher shark) were higher than that in other tissues. THg concentrations for all tissues were significantly correlated with precaudal length, with higher accumulation rates after maturity in pelagic than bigeye thresher sharks, suggesting an associated dietary shift at maturation. Correlations among tissues in both species suggested similar transportation and distribution patterns in internal tissues. The δ(13)C values in muscle, RBC and plasma suggested that habitat shifts influenced Hg accumulation, whereas trophic position, estimated by δ(15)N values, had limited effects on patterns of Hg bioaccumulation. Diet shifts towards prey more cephalopods that content higher Hg than small fishes (large fishes: 1.77 μg g(-1); cephalopods: 0.66 μg g(-1) and small fishes 0.48 μg g(-1), dry weight) increased Hg accumulation rates in adult pelagic thresher sharks. Concentrations of MeHg in the muscle of both thresher shark (3.42 ± 1.68 μg g(-1) in A. pelagicus and 3.78 ± 2.13 μg g(-1) in A. superciliosus) exceeded the recommended levels for human consumption. This research provides insight into the factors influencing mercury bioaccumulation in thresher sharks, which are essential for the management and conservation of these species.","Animals and Humans and *Mercury/analysis and Bioaccumulation and Ecosystem and *Methylmercury Compounds and Body Size and *Sharks and Body Weight and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2023/03/17 06:00,S0048-9697(23)00864-1 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162248 [doi],36804976,0330500,"FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury) and 0 (Methylmercury Compounds) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",Netherlands,Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

We studied the differences in food source use between sexes, life stages and seasons using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses. To supplement stable isotope analyses, we evaluated food source usage using traditional stomach content analysis. We tested the hypothesis that juveniles have a different diet, showing different trophic niches, compared to adults. Results indicated that signal crayfish adult and juvenile diets mainly rely on macroinvertebrates and periphyton in summer, shifting to mostly periphyton in autumn. Although the two age classes occupied an equivalent trophic niche, juveniles showed slightly different carbon isotope values, suggesting a somewhat ontogenetic shift consistent among seasons.

Our results highlighted that the two species share a similar diet based mostly on the consumption of benthic crustaceans (e.g. hermit crabs). Their trophic level increases during ontogeny, with adults increasing their consumption of large-sized crustaceans (e.g. Calappa granulata, Palinurus elephas), cephalopods (e.g. Octopus vulgaris) and fish (e.g. Trachurus trachurus). Our results provide also evidence of ontogenetic shifts in diet for both species showing a progressive reduction of interspecific trophic overlap during growth. The results of this study contribute to improve the current knowledge on the trophic ecology of these two threatened sharks in the Strait of Sicily, thus providing a better understanding of their role in the food web.",Animal Feed/*analysis and Animals and Conservation of Natural Resources and Female and Isotope Labeling and Male and Mediterranean Sea and Sharks/classification/*growth & development/physiology,2020/12/15 06:00,10.1038/s41598-020-67858-x [pii] and 67858 [pii] and 10.1038/s41598-020-67858-x [doi],32620846,101563288,NA,England,NA,10.1038/s41598-020-67858-x [doi] and 11011,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC7335154,The authors declare no competing interests.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we report nitrogen (N) isotope turnover rates in tissues of four primary consumer species: Ancistrus triradiatus armored catfish (muscle, fins, and whole blood), Tarebia granifera snails (muscle), and Rana palmipes tadpoles (muscle) from a Venezuelan river, and Lavigeria grandis snails (muscle) from Lake Tanganyika, East Africa. Turnover was estimated from the dilution of a 15N label introduced into consumer tissues by feeding on 15N-enriched periphyton. Muscle turnover rates were rapid (0.5-3.8% per day), and were attributable to metabolic replacement of N as well as growth in catfish and snails. N turnover in catfish muscle decreased with size, and fin tissue turned over more rapidly than whole blood or muscle, though the difference was not significant. Our results indicate that stable isotope signatures of these tropical species could change markedly within weeks following a shift in diet. However, generalization across taxa or latitudes is complicated by the strong size-dependence of isotope turnover rates. The enrichment-dilution approach outlined here may facilitate measurement of isotopic turnover in a wide variety of consumers under field conditions.","Animals and Anura/*physiology and Fishes/*physiology and Food Chain and Fresh Water and Muscle, Skeletal/*metabolism and Nitrogen/*metabolism and Nitrogen Isotopes and Snails/*physiology and Time Factors and Tropical Climate",2006/08/02 09:00,10.1007/s00442-005-0354-3 [doi],16456686,0150372,0 (Nitrogen Isotopes) and N762921K75 (Nitrogen),Germany,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Human exposure to MMHg occurs predominately through the consumption of fishery foods and rice in Asia, but it is challenging to quantify these two exposure sources. Here, we innovatively utilized MMHg compound-specific stable isotope analyses (MMHg-CSIA) of the hair to quantify the human MMHg sources in coastal and inland areas, where fishery foods and rice are routinely consumed. Our data showed that the fishery foods and rice end members had distinct Δ(199)Hg(MMHg) values in both coastal and inland areas. The Δ(199)Hg(MMHg) values of the human hair were comparable to those of fishery foods but not those of rice. Positive shifts in the δ(202)Hg(MMHg) values of the hair from diet were observed in the study areas. Additionally, significant differences in δ(202)Hg versus Δ(199)Hg were detected between MMHg and inorganic Hg (IHg) in the human hair but not in fishery foods and rice. A binary mixing model was developed to estimate the human MMHg exposures from fishery foods and rice using Δ(199)Hg(MMHg) data. The model results suggested that human MMHg exposures were dominated (>80%) by fishery food consumption and were less affected by rice consumption in both the coastal and inland areas.

We examined this question by comparing the blubber fatty acid (FA) composition and stable carbon isotope ratios of individual FA (δ¹³CFA) of adult ringed seals (Pusa hispida), bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus), spotted seals (Phoca largha), and ribbon seals (Histriophoca fasciata), collectively known as ""ice seals,"" sampled during an anomalously warm, low sea ice period in 2002-2005 in the Bering Sea and a subsequent cold, high sea ice period in 2007-2010. δ¹³C(FA) values, used to estimate the contribution to seals of carbon derived from sea ice algae (sympagic production) relative to that derived from water column phytoplankton (pelagic production), indicated that during the cold period, sympagic production accounted for 62-80% of the FA in the blubber of bearded seals, 51-62% in spotted seals, and 21-60% in ringed seals. Moreover, the δ¹³CFA values of bearded seals indicated a greater incorporation of sympagic FAs during the cold period than the warm period. This result provides the first empirical evidence of an ecosystem-scale effect of a putative change in sympagic production in the Western Arctic. The FA composition of ice seals showed clear evidence of resource partitioning among ringed, bearded, and spotted seals, and little niche separation between spotted and ribbon seals, which is consistent with previous studies. Despite interannual variability, the FA composition of ringed and bearded seals showed little evidence of differences in diet between the warm and cold periods. The findings that sympagic production contributes significantly to food webs supporting ice seals, and that the contribution apparently is less in warm years with low sea ice, raise an important concern: Will the projected warming and continuing loss of seasonal sea ice in the Arctic, and the associated decline of organic matter input from sympagic production, be compensated for by pelagic production to satisfy both pelagic and benthic carbon and energy needs?","Animals and Arctic Regions and Carbon/*physiology and Carbon Cycle and *Climate Change and Environmental Monitoring/*methods and *Food Chain and Models, Biological and *Oceans and Seas and Seals, Earless/*physiology",2016/08/09 06:00,10.1890/14-2421 [doi],27411254,9889808,7440-44-0 (Carbon),United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Especially in anaerobic habitats, a large diversity of unrecognized microbial populations may be responsible for their degradation. Still, our present understanding of the respective microbiota and their ecophysiology is almost exclusively based on a small number of cultured organisms, mostly within the Proteobacteria. Here, by DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP), we directly identified the most active sulfate-reducing toluene degraders in a diverse sedimentary microbial community originating from a tar-oil-contaminated aquifer at a former coal gasification plant. On incubation of fresh sediments with (13)C(7)-toluene, the production of both sulfide and (13)CO(2) was clearly coupled to the (13)C-labeling of DNA of microbes related to Desulfosporosinus spp. within the Peptococcaceae (Clostridia). The screening of labeled DNA fractions also suggested a novel benzylsuccinate synthase alpha-subunit (bssA) sequence type previously only detected in the environment to be tentatively affiliated with these degraders. However, carbon flow from the contaminant into degrader DNA was only ∼50%, pointing toward high ratios of heterotrophic CO(2)-fixation during assimilation of acetyl-CoA originating from the contaminant by these degraders. These findings demonstrate that the importance of non-proteobacterial populations in anaerobic aromatics degradation, as well as their specific ecophysiology in the subsurface may still be largely ungrasped.","Bacterial Proteins/genetics and Carbon Dioxide/metabolism and Carbon-Carbon Lyases/genetics and DNA/*genetics/*isolation & purification and DNA, Bacterial/chemistry/genetics and *Environmental Microbiology and Environmental Pollutants/metabolism and Molecular Sequence Data and Oxidation-Reduction and Peptococcaceae/genetics/*isolation & purification/*metabolism and Petroleum/metabolism and Sequence Analysis, DNA and Sulfates/*metabolism and Tars/metabolism and Toluene/*metabolism",2011/01/05 06:00,ismej201054 [pii] and 10.1038/ismej.2010.54 [doi],20428224,101301086,"0 (Bacterial Proteins) and 0 (DNA, Bacterial) and 0 (Environmental Pollutants) and 0 (Petroleum) and 0 (Sulfates) and 0 (Tars) and 142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide) and 3FPU23BG52 (Toluene) and 9007-49-2 (DNA) and EC 4.1.- (Carbon-Carbon Lyases) and EC 4.1.99.- (benzylsuccinate synthase)",England,NA,10.1038/ismej.2010.54 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,GENBANK/GU133208 and GENBANK/GU133209 and GENBANK/GU133210 and GENBANK/GU133211 and GENBANK/GU133212 and GENBANK/GU133213 and GENBANK/GU133214 and GENBANK/GU133215 and GENBANK/GU133216 and GENBANK/GU133217 and GENBANK/GU133218 and GENBANK/GU133219 and GENBANK/GU133220 and GENBANK/GU133221 and GENBANK/GU133222 and GENBANK/GU133223 and GENBANK/GU133224 and GENBANK/GU133225 and GENBANK/GU133226 and GENBANK/GU133227 and GENBANK/GU133228 and GENBANK/GU133229 and GENBANK/GU133230 and GENBANK/GU133231 and GENBANK/GU133232 and GENBANK/GU133233 and GENBANK/GU133234 and GENBANK/GU133235 and GENBANK/GU133236 and GENBANK/GU133237 and GENBANK/GU133238 and GENBANK/GU133239 and GENBANK/GU133240 and GENBANK/GU133241 and GENBANK/GU133242 and GENBANK/GU133243 and GENBANK/GU133244 and GENBANK/GU133245 and GENBANK/GU133246 and GENBANK/GU133247 and GENBANK/GU133248 and GENBANK/GU133249 and GENBANK/GU133250 and GENBANK/GU133251 and GENBANK/GU133252 and GENBANK/GU133253 and GENBANK/GU133254 and GENBANK/GU133255 and GENBANK/GU133256 and GENBANK/GU133257 and GENBANK/GU133258 and GENBANK/GU133259 and GENBANK/GU133260 and GENBANK/GU133261 and GENBANK/GU133262 and GENBANK/GU133263 and GENBANK/GU133264 and GENBANK/GU133265 and GENBANK/GU133266 and GENBANK/GU133267 and GENBANK/GU133268 and GENBANK/GU133269 and GENBANK/GU133270 and GENBANK/GU133271 and GENBANK/GU133272 and GENBANK/GU133273 and GENBANK/GU133274 and GENBANK/GU133275 and GENBANK/GU133276 and GENBANK/GU133277 and GENBANK/GU133278 and GENBANK/GU133279 and GENBANK/GU133280 and GENBANK/GU133281 and GENBANK/GU133282 and GENBANK/GU133283 and GENBANK/GU133284 and GENBANK/GU133285 and GENBANK/GU133286 and GENBANK/GU133287 and GENBANK/GU133288 and GENBANK/GU133289 and GENBANK/GU133290 and GENBANK/GU133291 and GENBANK/GU133292 and GENBANK/GU133293 and GENBANK/GU133294 and GENBANK/GU133295 and GENBANK/GU133296 and GENBANK/GU133297 and GENBANK/GU133298 and GENBANK/GU133299 and GENBANK/GU133300 and GENBANK/GU133301 and GENBANK/GU133302 and GENBANK/GU133303 and GENBANK/GU133304 and GENBANK/GU133305 and GENBANK/GU133306 and GENBANK/GU133307 and GENBANK/GU133308 and GENBANK/GU133309,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Estuarine crocodiles in Australia are a large carnivore conservation success story, with the population having extensively recovered from past heavy exploitation. Here, we explored if dietary changes had accompanied this large population recovery by comparing the isotopes δ(13)C and δ(15)N in bones of crocodiles sampled 40 to 55 years ago (small population) with bones from contemporary individuals (large population). We found that δ(13)C and δ(15)N values were significantly lower in contemporary crocodiles than in the historical cohort, inferring a shift in prey preference away from marine and into terrestrial food webs. We propose that an increase in intraspecific competition within the recovering crocodile population, alongside an increased abundance of feral ungulates occupying the floodplains, may have resulted in the crocodile population shifting to feed predominantly upon terrestrial food sources. The number of feral pigs consumed to sustain and grow crocodile biomass may help suppress pig population growth and increase the flow of terrestrially derived nutrients into aquatic ecosystems.

Pygmy grasshoppers (Paratettix aztecus and P. mexicanus; Tetrigidae) graze river algae stranded along shorelines of the South Fork Eel River in northern California (39°44'N, 123°39'W) as the river recedes during the summer drought. Densities of tetrigids during the mid to late summer were highest (1 individual/m(2) in July) within 1 m of the river margin, and declined to near zero at 4 m from the margin, especially during peak temperatures in the afternoon. These observations suggested that the distribution of tetrigids was determined by the availability of algae, water, or both. We manipulated the presence/absence of water and beached algae (Cladophora glomerata) in a 2×2 factorial design. All treatments were positioned 2 m upslope from the river's edge (about 30 cm above the water table), where the cobble bar was naturally dry and devoid of algae and densities of tetrigids were lower than at the river margin (0.4 individuals/m(2) in July). Tetrigids responded only to the wet Cladophora treatment, which had 30× higher densities than other treatments. Stable isotopic signatures (δ(13)C) of tetrigids (-19.7‰) collected from the same cobble bars were more similar to those of epilithic algae (-20.4‰) than terrestrial plants (-28.2‰), and higher than those of acridid grasshoppers (-27.9‰) from the same habitats. Mixing models suggest that 88-100% of the C in tetrigid grasshoppers at our study site is derived from riverine algae. A preliminary analysis suggests that tetrigids ingested sufficient quantities of algae to easily meet their energetic demands during the summer.

However, estuaries have been used as fishing grounds by the artisanal fishers in Tanzania. The slow-growing predatory fish at juvenile and sub-adult stages are among the most frequently caught species that functionally enhance multiple linkages of energy pathways within the food web. Stomach contents and stable isotopes (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) were used to describe the nutritional sources and trophic niches between the co-existing benthic, predatory species, Carangoides chrysophrys and Epinephelus malabaricus in the Pangani estuary, Tanzania. RESULTS: The findings indicated significant inter-specific variations in dietary composition (PERMANOVA, p = 0.001, pseudo-F = 15.81). The prey-specific index of relative importance (%PSIRI) indicated that juvenile shrimps (%PSIRI = 51.4) and Teleostei (%PSIRI = 26.5) were the main diets of C. chrysophrys while brachyura (%PSIRI = 38.8), juvenile shrimps (%PSIRI = 25.6) and Teleostei (%PSIRI = 23.3) were important diets of E. malabaricus. The isotope mixing models indicated that the predatory fish species accumulate nutrients derived from similar autotrophic sources, microphytobenthos, seagrass and macro-algae via consumption of small fish, including clupeids and mugilids. Yet, they significantly showed different isotopic niche width with varying degree of niche overlap across the longitudinal estuary gradient. This situation was justified by the presence of basal food sources among the estuarine zones that isotopically were different. CONCLUSION: The reliance of both predators on clupeids and mugilid preys that are trophically linked with estuarine and marine basal food sources, is an indication of low estuarine food webs' connectivity to the fresh water related food web. This situation is most likely threatening the stability of the estuarine food web structure. Management strategies and plans in place should be cautiously implemented to ensure the balanced anthropogenic freshwater use in the catchment and fishing activities, for the maintenance of the Pangani estuarine ecosystem health.",NA,2018/07/11 06:01,84 [pii] and 10.1186/s40709-018-0084-4 [doi],29988702,101248115,NA,Greece,NA,10.1186/s40709-018-0084-4 [doi] and 13,Juvenile fish and Niches and Pangani estuary and Predator and Trophic resources,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,PMC6029293,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Over the past decades, the St. Lawrence marine ecosystem (Canada) has experienced major changes in its physical, chemical, and biological conditions from overfishing, acoustic and chemical pollution, climate change, and the increased abundance of some top predators. These changes have likely affected the trophodynamics of the ecosystem, and are suspected to have deleterious effects on endangered species of mammals and other components of the ecosystem, such as blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), fin whales (B. physalus), and beluga (Delphinapterus leucas). This study examined the trophic structure of the St. Lawrence marine ecosystem, including the isotopic niche of various species, over two periods of contrasting pressures from anthropogenic and climatic stressors (1995-2003 vs. 2019-2021). Stable isotope ratios were measured in 1240 samples of 21 species of marine invertebrates, fishes, and mammals sampled during both periods. A significant change in the isotopic value and niche position between periods is observed in most of the sampled species. While the direction of change and effect size were not uniform among species, these changes confirmed that substantial modifications in community structure have occurred over time. Niche overlap decreased considerably among some of the pelagic and demersal fishes, and among whale species during the most recent period. Combined with a concomitant reduction in niche breadth in several species, these observations suggested that resource sharing was limited among these species.

Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) enzymes are extremely desired and important in the industry of production for goods and biofuel and removal of problematic biofilms and exopolysaccharide (EPS). Biofilms and EPS are complex, requiring a wide range of enzymes for a complete degradation. The aim of this study was to identify potential GH microbial producers and GH genes with biotechnological potential, using EPS-complex structure (WH15EPS) of Acidobacteria Granulicella sp. strain WH15 as an enrichment factor, in cultivation-independent and cultivation-dependent methods. We performed stable isotope probing (SIP) combined with metagenomics on topsoil litter amended with WH15EPS and coupled solid culture-EPS amended medium with metagenomics. RESULTS: SIP metagenome analysis of the soil litter demonstrated that phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Planctomycetes were the most abundant in WH15EPS amended and unamended treatments. The enrichment cultures in solid culture medium coupled to metagenomics demonstrated an enrichment in Proteobacteria, and the metagenome assembly of this enrichment cultures resulted in 4 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of microbes with low identity (42-86%) to known microorganisms. Among all carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) retrieved genes, glycoside transferase (GT) was the most abundant family, either in culture-independent or culture-based metagenome datasets. Within the glycoside hydrolases (GHs), GH13 was the most abundant family in both metagenome datasets. In the ""heavy"" fraction of the culture-independent metagenome SIP dataset, GH109 (α-N-acetylgalactosaminidases), GH117 (agarases), GH50 (agarases), GH32 (invertases and inulinases), GH17 (endoglucanases), and GH71 (mutanases) families were more abundant in comparison with the controls. Those GH families are affiliated to microorganism that are probably capable to degrade WH15EPS and potentially applicable for biofilm deconstruction. Subsequent in culture-based metagenome, the assembled 4 MAGs (unclassified Proteobacteria) also contained GH families of interest, involving mannosidases, lysozymes, galactosidases, and chitinases. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that functional diversity induced by the presence of WH15EPS in both culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches was enriched in GHs, such as amylases and endoglucanases that could be applied in chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industrial sectors. Furthermore, WH15EPS may be used for the investigation and isolation of yet unknown taxa, such as unclassified Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes, increasing the number of current cultured bacterial representatives with potential biotechnological traits.

The last remnants of the European Pleistocene megafauna that survived into the Holocene were particularly vulnerable to changes in habitat. To track the response of habitat use and foraging of large herbivores to natural and anthropogenic changes in environmental conditions during the Holocene, we investigated carbon (δ(13) C) and nitrogen (δ(15) N) stable isotope composition in bone collagen of moose (Alces alces), European bison (Bison bonasus) and aurochs (Bos primigenius) in Central and Eastern Europe. We found strong variations in isotope compositions in the studied species throughout the Holocene and diverse responses to changing environmental conditions. All three species showed significant changes in their δ(13) C values reflecting a shift of foraging habitats from more open in the Early and pre-Neolithic Holocene to more forest during the Neolithic and Late Holocene. This shift was strongest in European bison, suggesting higher plasticity, more limited in moose, and the least in aurochs. Significant increases of δ(15) N values in European bison and moose are evidence of a diet change towards more grazing, but may also reflect increased nitrogen in soils following deglaciation and global temperature increases. Among the factors explaining the observed isotope variations were time (age of samples), longitude and elevation in European bison, and time, longitude and forest cover in aurochs. None of the analysed factors explained isotope variations in moose. Our results demonstrate the strong influence of natural (forest expansion) and anthropogenic (deforestation and human pressure) changes on the foraging ecology of large herbivores, with forests playing a major role as a refugial habitat since the Neolithic, particularly for European bison and aurochs. We propose that high flexibility in foraging strategy was the key for survival of large herbivores in the changing environmental conditions of the Holocene.","Animals and *Bison and Cattle and Ecosystem and Europe and Europe, Eastern and *Herbivory",2019/10/12 06:00,10.1111/gcb.14733 [doi],31298814,9888746,NA,England,© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,10.1111/gcb.14733 [doi],Alces alces and Bison bonasus and Bos primigenius and European bison and aurochs and foraging ecology and moose and stable isotopes,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Sierra Nevada of California was used as a model system to investigate connections between the physiological performance of trees and landscape patterns of forest carbon and water use. The intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE)-an index of CO(2) fixed per unit of potential water lost via transpiration-of nine dominant species was determined in replicated transects along an ∼1,500-m elevation gradient, spanning a broad range of climatic conditions and soils derived from three different parent materials. Stable isotope ratios of carbon and oxygen measured at the leaf level were combined with field-based and remotely sensed metrics of stand productivity, revealing that variation in iWUE depends primarily on leaf traits (∼24% of the variability), followed by stand productivity (∼16% of the variability), climatic regime (∼13% of the variability), and soil development (∼12% of the variability). Significant interactions between species composition and soil properties proved useful to predict changes in forest carbon-water relations. On the basis of observed shifts in tree species composition, ongoing since the 1950s and intensified in recent years, an increase in water loss through transpiration (ranging from 10 to 60% depending on parent material) is now expected in mixed conifer forests throughout the region.","California and Carbon/*metabolism and *Forests and *Models, Biological and *Soil and Trees/*growth & development and Water/*metabolism",2018/08/16 06:00,1718864115 [pii] and 201718864 [pii] and 10.1073/pnas.1718864115 [doi],29666233,7505876,0 (Soil) and 059QF0KO0R (Water) and 7440-44-0 (Carbon),United States,Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

We have queried how soil compartment (rhizosphere vs bulk soil) and nature of prey (Gram-positive vs Gram-negative) influence predation outcomes. We added 13C-labelled biomass of Pseudomonas putida and Arthrobacter globiformis to soil microcosms and found that P. putida was consumed much more rapidly. Bacteria and microeukaryotes specifically responsive to the biomass amendments were identified by RNA-stable isotope probing. Amongst the bacteria, only a few myxobacteria sequestered C from A. globiformis, whereas a considerable diversity of predatory bacteria incorporated C derived from P. putida. Diverse groups of heterotrophic protists, especially amoeba including Glaeseria, Hartmanella and Vahlkampfia spp., were observed to incorporate 13C from both amendments, but with pronounced niche differentiation between rhizosphere and bulk soil.

Previous studies have identified a wide range of prey items; however, due to anecdotal or otherwise limited information, leopard seal diets remain unresolved by seal sex, individual, body size, region, and season. Over the 2013, 2014, and 2017 field seasons we collected scat, tissue samples (red blood cells and plasma; n = 23) for stable isotope analyses, and previously-reported animal-borne video from 19 adult leopard seals foraging near mesopredator breeding colonies at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island. We summarized a priori diet information from scat and video analysis and applied a three-isotope (δ(13)C, δ(15)N, δ(34)S), four-source (fish, fur seal, krill, penguin) Bayesian mixing model to examine temporal variability in both prey sources and leopard seal tissues. RESULTS: The austral spring diets of males and females focused on Antarctic krill (31.7-38.0%), notothen fish (31.6-36.5%), and penguin (24.4-26.9%) and were consistent across all 3 years. Several lines of evidence suggest the transition to summer foraging was distinct for males and females. Female diets transitioned rapidly to higher δ(15)N values (+2.1‰), indicating increased consumption of penguin (29.5-46.2%) and energy-dense Antarctic fur seal pup (21.3-37.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The seasonal increase in leopard seal δ(15)N values, and thus fur seal in their diet, was predictably related to larger body size; it may also be forcing reductions to the largest Antarctic fur seal colony in the Antarctic Peninsula. Our ensemble sampling approach reduces historical biases in monitoring marine apex predator diets. Further, our results are necessary to best inform regional fisheries management planning.","Animals and Antarctic Regions and Bayes Theorem and Body Size and Cold Climate and *Diet and Female and Male and Predatory Behavior and *Seals, Earless and Seasons",2020/09/05 06:00,10.1186/s12898-020-00300-y [pii] and 300 [pii] and 10.1186/s12898-020-00300-y [doi],32493329,101088674,NA,England,NA,10.1186/s12898-020-00300-y [doi] and 32,Animal-borne video and Apex predator and Climate change and Hydrurga leptonyx and Prey shift and Stable isotope mixing model and Top down,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,PMC7271520,The authors declare that they have no competing interests.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Generalist insect predators provide an important biological service in the regulation of agricultural insect pests. Our goal is to understand the explicit process of oviposition preference, habitat selection and feeding behavior of predators in farmland ecosystem consisting of multiple crops, which is central to devising and delivering an integrated pest management program. METHODOLOGY: The hypotheses was that maize can serve as habitat for natural enemies and benefits predators to provide potential to enhance biological control for pest insects in cotton. This explicit process of a predatory beetle, Propylea japonica, in agricultural ecosystem composed of cotton and maize were examined by field investigation and stable carbon isotope analysis during 2008-2010. PRINCIPAL FINDING: Field investigation showed that P. japonica adults will search host plants for high prey abundance before laying eggs, indicating indirectly that P. japonica adults prefer to inhabit maize plants and travel to cotton plants to actively prey on aphids. The δ(13)C values of adult P. japonica in a dietary shift experiment found that individual beetles were shifting from a C(3)- to a C(4)-based diet of aphids reared on maize or cotton, respectively, and began to reflect the isotope ratio of their new C(4) resources within one week. Approximately 80-100% of the diet of P. japonica adults in maize originated from a C(3)-based resource in June, July and August, while approximately 80% of the diet originated from a C(4)-based resource in September. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Results suggest that maize can serve as a habitat or refuge source for the predatory beetle, P. japonica, and benefits predators to provide potential to enhance biological control for insect pests in cotton.","Animals and Aphids/*physiology and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Coleoptera/*physiology and Ecosystem and Feeding Behavior and Gossypium/*metabolism and Models, Statistical and Oviposition and Pest Control, Biological/*methods and Predatory Behavior and Zea mays/*physiology",2013/03/13 06:00,PONE-D-12-01217 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0044379 [doi],22984499,101285081,0 (Carbon Isotopes),United States,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0044379 [doi] and e44379,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC3440376,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The majority of plants support N uptake by symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Mineralization of N is regulated by microfauna, in particular, protozoa grazing on bacteria. We hypothesized that AM fungi and protozoa interactively facilitate plant N nutrition from OM. In soil systems consisting of an OM patch and a root compartment, plant N uptake and consequences for plant carbon (C) allocation were investigated using stable isotopes. Protozoa mobilized N by consuming bacteria, and the mobilized N was translocated via AM fungi to the host plant. The presence of protozoa in both the OM and root compartment stimulated photosynthesis and the translocation of C from the host plant via AM fungi into the OM patch. This stimulated microbial activity in the OM patch, plant N uptake from OM and doubled plant growth. The results indicate that protozoa increase plant growth by both mobilization of N from OM and by protozoa-root interactions, resulting in increased C allocation to roots and into the rhizosphere, thereby increasing plant nutrient exploitation.

Sharks, however, have a variety of feeding and life history strategies and metabolize lipid uniquely. Because of this diversity, and the lipid-association of organochlorines, the dynamics of organochlorine accumulation in sharks may be predicted ineffectively by stable isotope-derived trophic position and body mass, as is typical for other taxa. The present study compared ontogenetic organochlorine profiles in the dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) and white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), which differ in metabolic thermoregulation and trophic position throughout their ontogeny. Although greater organochlorine concentrations were observed in the larger bodied and higher trophic position white shark (e.g., p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene: 20.2 ± 2.7 ng/g vs 9.3 ± 2.2 ng/g in the dusky shark), slopes of growth-dilution corrected concentrations with age were equal to those of the dusky shark. Similar ontogenetic trophic position increases in both species, less frequent white shark seal predation than previously assumed, or inaccurate species-specific growth parameters are possible explanations. Inshore habitat use (indicated by δ(13)C values) and mass were important predictors in white and dusky sharks, respectively, of both overall compound profiles and select organochlorine concentrations. The present study clarified understanding of trophic position and body mass as reliable predictors of interspecific organochlorine accumulation in sharks, whereas regional endothermy and diet shifting were shown to have less impact on overall rates of accumulation.","Aging and Animals and Body Weight and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Ecosystem and Female and Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated/analysis/*metabolism and Isotope Labeling and Male and Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis and Sharks/*metabolism and Species Specificity",2016/04/05 06:00,10.1002/etc.3029 [doi],25899033,8308958,"0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 0 (Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated) and 0 (Nitrogen Isotopes)",United States,© 2015 SETAC.,10.1002/etc.3029 [doi],Bioaccumulation and Dusky shark and Organochlorine and Stable isotopes and White shark,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To investigate SRB involvement in methylation in Amazonian periphyton, the relationship between Hg methylation potential and SRB (Desulfobacteraceae, Desulfobulbaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae) abundance in Eichhornia crassipes and Polygonum densiflorum root associated periphyton was examined. Periphyton subsamples of each macrophyte were amended with electron donors (lactate, acetate and propionate) or inhibitors (molybdate) of sulfate reduction to create differences in SRB subgroup abundance, which was measured by quantitative real-time PCR with primers specific for the 16S rRNA gene. Mercury methylation and demethylation potentials were determined by a stable isotope tracer technique using 200HgCl and CH3(202)HgCl, respectively. Relative abundance of Desulfobacteraceae (<0.01-12.5%) and Desulfovibrionaceae (0.01-6.8%) were both highly variable among samples and subsamples, but a significant linear relationship (p<0.05) was found between Desulfobacteraceae abundance and net methylmercury formation among treatments of the same macrophyte periphyton and among all P. densiflorum samples, suggesting that Desulfobacteraceae bacteria are the most important mercury methylators among SRB families. Yet, molybdate only partially inhibited mercury methylation potentials, suggesting the involvement of other microorganisms as well. The response of net methylmercury production to the different electron donors and molybdate was highly variable (3-1104 pg g(-1) in 12 h) among samples, as was the net formation in control samples (17-164 pg g(-1) in 12 h). This demonstrates the importance of community variability and complexity of microbial interactions for the overall methylmercury production in periphyton and their response to external stimulus.","Bolivia and Desulfurococcaceae/genetics/metabolism and Eichhornia/metabolism/*microbiology and Methylation and Methylmercury Compounds/*metabolism and Plant Roots/metabolism/microbiology and Polygonum/metabolism/*microbiology and Rhizosphere and Sulfur-Reducing Bacteria/genetics/*metabolism and Water Pollutants, Chemical/*metabolism",2011/03/15 06:00,S0045-6535(10)01193-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.10.050 [doi],21074243,0320657,"0 (Methylmercury Compounds) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",England,Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

While soils are important stores of terrestrial C, anthropogenic impact on the lateral fluxes of C from land to water remains poorly quantified and not well represented in Earth system models. In this study, we tested a novel framework for tracing and quantifying lateral C fluxes from the terrestrial to the aquatic environment at a catchment scale. The combined use of conservative plant-derived geochemical biomarkers n-alkanes and bulk stable δ(13)C and δ(15)N isotopes of soils and sediments allowed us to distinguish between particulate organic C sources from different land uses (i.e. arable and temporary grassland vs. permanent grassland vs. riparian woodland vs. river bed sediments) (p<0.001), showing an enhanced ability to distinguish between land use sources as compared to using just n-alkanes alone. The terrestrial-aquatic proxy (TAR) ratio derived from n-alkane signatures indicated an increased input of terrestrial-derived organic matter (OM) to lake sediments over the past 60years, with an increasing contribution of woody vegetation shown by the C(27)/C(31) ratio. This may be related to agricultural intensification, leading to enhanced soil erosion, but also an increase in riparian woodland that may disconnect OM inputs from arable land uses in the upper parts of the study catchment. Spatial variability of geochemical proxies showed a close coupling between OM provenance and riparian land use, supporting the new conceptualization of river corridors (active river channel and riparian zone) as critical zones linking the terrestrial and aquatic C fluxes. Further testing of this novel tracing technique shows promise in terms of quantification of lateral C fluxes as well as targeting of effective land management measures to reduce soil erosion and promote OM conservation in river catchments.",NA,2017/11/07 06:01,S0048-9697(17)32930-3 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.10.211 [doi],29107375,0330500,NA,Netherlands,Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, such changes are usually associated with transition from specialist to generalist predator species, rather than from geographical variation in dietary breadth of specialist predators. Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) populations undergo cyclic fluctuations in northern parts of their range, but cycles are either greatly attenuated or lost altogether in the southern boreal forest where prey diversity is higher. We tested the influence of prey specialization on population cycles by measuring the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in lynx and their prey, estimating the contribution of hares to lynx diet across their range, and correlating this degree of specialization to the strength of their population cycles. Hares dominated the lynx diet across their range, but specialization on hares decreased in southern and western populations. The degree of specialization correlated with cyclic signal strength indicated by spectral analysis of lynx harvest data, but overall variability of lynx harvest (the standard deviation of natural-log-transformed harvest numbers) did not change significantly with dietary specialization. Thus, as alternative prey became more important in the lynx diet, the fluctuations became decoupled from a regular cycle but did not become less variable. Our results support the hypothesis that alternative prey decrease population cycle regularity but emphasize that such changes may be driven by dietary shifts among dominant specialist predators rather than exclusively through changes in the predator community.",Animals and Biodiversity and Canada and Demography and *Diet and *Ecosystem and Female and Food Supply and Hares/*physiology and Lynx/*physiology and Male and Population Density and Population Dynamics and Predatory Behavior/*physiology and Species Specificity,2008/01/23 09:00,10.1890/07-0147.1 [doi],18051641,0043541,NA,United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The isotopic features of the hairtail at the same body size differed among regions, with the fish in coastal waters presenting higher δ(15)N and δ(13)C values compared to those in the open sea, indicating different trophic levels (TL), food habits, and isotopic baselines. According to the partial correlation of water depth with δ(15)N values, the sampling stations were divided into three regions based on the depth of water: coastal (20-40 m), near coastal (60-80 m), and open sea (100-200 m) regions. In the coastal region, the hairtail from stations affected by the Pearl River plume exhibited lower δ(15)N and δ(13)C values. The stomach content analysis indicated different feeding habits of the hairtail from different regions. The hairtail in the coastal and near coastal waters fed more on fish and less on crustaceans compared to the hairtail in the open sea. The relationship between δ(15)N and fish size exhibited two contrary patterns. First, the δ(15)N values increased with increasing preanal length in the hairtail sampled from the water depth of 30-40 m in section F (in fish with preanal length < 200 mm) and those samples from the water depth of 100-200 m. This finding reflected an ontogenetic shift in diet and TL. However, the δ(15)N values tended to decrease with the increasing preanal length of the hairtail samples collected from the water depth of 30-40 m in section F (fish with a preanal length of ~200-300 mm). These findings suggested that under the conditions of insufficient availability of high-quality prey, the larger hairtail fed more on low-TL prey to compensate for the increase energy demand, arising due to growth, which led to the observed decrease in δ(15)N values.",Animals and *Gastrointestinal Contents/chemistry and *Perciformes and Fishes and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and China and Water/analysis,2023/09/20 06:42,S0048-9697(23)03936-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165313 [doi],37406705,0330500,0 (Carbon Isotopes) and 059QF0KO0R (Water),Netherlands,Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

One of the main constituents of aquatic subsidy, the non-biting midges (Chironomidae), showed altered emergence dynamics in response to the mosquito control agent Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti). As riparian spiders depend on aquatic subsidy, they may be affected by such changes in prey availability. Thus, we conducted a field study in twelve floodplain pond mesocosms (FPMs), six were treated with Bti (2.88 × 10(9) ITU/ha, VectoBac WDG) three times, to investigate if the Bti-induced shift in chironomid emergence dynamics is reflected in their nutritional value and in the diet of riparian spiders. We measured the content of proteins, lipids, glycogen, and carbohydrates in emerged Chironomidae, and determined the stable isotope ratios of female Tetragnatha extensa, a web-building spider living in the riparian vegetation of the FPMs. We analysed the proportion of aquatic prey in spiders' diet, niche size, and trophic position. While the content of nutrients and thus the prey quality was not significantly altered by Bti, effects on the spiders' diet were observed. The trophic position of T. extensa from Bti-treated FPMs was lower compared to the control while the aquatic proportion was only minimally reduced. We assume that spiders fed more on terrestrial prey but also on other aquatic organisms such as Baetidae, whose emergence was unaffected by Bti. In contrast to the partly predaceous Chironomidae, consumption of aquatic and terrestrial primary consumers potentially explains the observed lower trophic position of spiders from Bti-treated FPMs. As prey organisms vary in their quality the suggested dietary shift could transfer previously observed effects of Bti to riparian spiders conceivably affecting their populations.

However, mesic-adapted Paederus beetles can survive over prolonged periods under dry field conditions, suggesting that these beetles adopt an array of water conservation mechanisms. We investigated the water balance mechanisms of field-collected Paederus adults over a 14-month sampling period. We also assessed their nutritional adaptations by performing a stable isotope analysis to examine their diet. The water loss rate (WLR) of the beetles was significantly associated with the rice crop cycle and saturation deficit. The cuticular permeability (CP) of adult beetles was maintained at < 30 µg cm(-2)h(-1) mmHg(-1); however, CP increased significantly with the WLR. This result indicates that CP might play a minor role in reducing excessive water loss in beetles. The beetles' body water content and percentage total body water content increased when the WLR was high. Trehalose, glucose, and glycogen did not appear to play a central role in enhancing the water reserves in the insects. The body lipid content ranged from 0.22 ± 0.06 to 0.87 ± 0.07 mg and was negatively associated with the WLR. This association indicates that the increase in internal metabolic water was mediated by lipid catabolism. Stable isotope analysis results revealed that the Paederus beetles shifted their diet to carbohydrate-rich plants when the saturation deficit increased and the associated WLR reached its peak; otherwise, they consumed a high amount of staple carbohydrate-poor herbivore prey. The accumulation of energy reserves in the form of lipids through seasonal dietary shifts may exert major effects on the survival and population success of mesic-adapted Paederus beetles.",*Acclimatization and Animals and Coleoptera/*metabolism and Desiccation and *Diet and Female and *Lipid Metabolism and Male and Seasons and Water/*metabolism,2021/09/24 06:00,S0022-1910(21)00036-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.jinsphys.2021.104226 [doi],33736982,2985080R,059QF0KO0R (Water),England,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

O(2) concentration plays a key role in AME-D, yet little is understood about how it impacts microbial interactions. Here, we applied isotopically labeled K(15)NO(3) and (13)CH(4) and metagenomic analyses to investigate the metabolic and microbial link of AME-D at different O(2) levels. Among the four experimental O(2) levels of 21%,10%, 5% and 2.5% and a CH(4) concentration of 8% (i.e., the O(2)/CH(4) ratios of 2.62, 1.26, 0.63 and 0.31), the highest NO(3)(-)-N removal occurred in the AME-D system incubated at the O(2) concentration of 10%. Methanol and acetate may serve as the trophic linkage between aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifers in the AME-D systems. Methylotrophs including Methylophilus, Methylovorus, Methyloversatilis and Methylotenera were abundant under the O(2)-sufficient condition with the O(2) concentration of 21%, while denitrifiers such as Azoarcus, Thauera and Thiobacillus dominated in the O(2)-limited environment with the O(2) concentration of 10%. The competition of denitrifiers and methylotrophs in the AME-D system for CH(4)-derived carbon, such as methanol and acetate, might be influenced by chemotactic responses. More methane-derived carbon flowed into methylotrophs under the O(2)-sufficient condition, while more methane-derived carbon was used for denitrification in the O(2)-limited environment. These findings can aid in evaluating the distribution and contribution of AME-D and in developing strategies for mitigating CH(4) emission and nitrogen pollution in natural and engineered ecosystems.",*Denitrification and Ecosystem and Metagenomics and *Methane and Oxidation-Reduction,2021/03/26 06:00,S0048-9697(20)36431-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142901 [doi],33757249,0330500,OP0UW79H66 (Methane),Netherlands,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We identified an interesting Spring accession, G302 (Mozart), that exhibited the highest WUE in the field and high CO2 assimilation rates coupled with an increased electron transport capacity (Jmax) under the imposed conditions. Differences in stomatal density and stomatal index did not translate to differences in stomatal conductance in the investigated accessions. Stomatal conductance response to exogenous ABA was analyzed in selected high and low WUE accessions. Spring lines showed little variation in response to exogenous ABA, while one Semi-Winter line (SW047) showed a significantly more rapid response to exogenous ABA, that corresponded to the high WUE indicated by δ13C measurements.

We combined the leaf stable dual isotopic signatures of carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) with related instantaneous gas exchange performance to determine the effects of O3 dose on the net photosynthetic rate (An), stomatal conductance (gs) and intrinsic WUE (iWUE = An/gs) in four tree species (one being a hybrid) exposed to five O3 levels. The iWUE declined for each step increase in O3 level, reflecting progressive loss of the coupling between leaf carbon gain and water loss. In ambient compared with charcoal-filtered air, the decreased iWUE was associated with reductions in both An and gs (i.e., decreased δ13C and increased δ18O). In elevated O3 treatments, however, the iWUE declines were caused by reduced An at constant or increased gs. The results show that the dual isotope approach provides a robust way to gather time-integrated information on how O3 pollution affects leaf gas exchange. Our study highlights that O3-induced decoupling between photosynthesis and stomatal regulation causes large and progressive declines in the WUE of forest trees, demonstrating the need for incorporating this hitherto unaccounted for effect into vegetation models.",Carbon and Oxygen/pharmacology and Oxygen Isotopes and *Ozone/pharmacology and Photosynthesis/physiology and Plant Leaves/physiology and *Trees/physiology and Water,2022/04/01 06:00,6209258 [pii] and 10.1093/treephys/tpab041 [doi],33822226,100955338,0 (Oxygen Isotopes) and 059QF0KO0R (Water) and 66H7ZZK23N (Ozone) and 7440-44-0 (Carbon) and S88TT14065 (Oxygen),Canada,"© The Author(s) 2021.

A subcellular partitioning procedure was employed to determine how metals were distributed between potentially sensitive and detoxified compartments of Arctic char livers from a low- and high-mercury lake (Small Lake and Amituk Lake, respectively). Differences in health indices and metal concentrations among char populations were likely related to differences in feeding ecology. Concentrations of Hg, Se, and Tl were highest in the livers of Amituk char, whereas concentrations of Fe were highest in Small and 9-Mile char. At the subcellular level we found that although Amituk char had higher concentrations of Tl in whole liver than Small Lake char, they maintained a greater proportion of this metal in detoxified fractions, suggesting an attempt at detoxification. Mercury was found mainly in potentially sensitive fractions of both Small and Amituk Lake char, indicating that Arctic char are not effectively detoxifying this metal.

This study analyzed phenotype-environment correlations in a fish invasion from initial absence until establishment in the headwater reach of the second largest European river, the Danube. Here, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) formed 73% of the fish abundance and 58% of the fish biomass in rip-rap bank habitats after establishment. The time from invasion until establishment was only about two years, indicating rapid expansion. Founder populations from the invasion front were different from longer established round goby populations in demography, morphology, feeding behaviour, sex ratio and parasitic load, indicating that plasticity in these traits determines invasion success. Competitive ability was mostly dependent on growth/size-related traits rather than on fecundity. As revealed by stable isotope analyses, specimens at the invasion front had a higher trophic position in the food web and seem to benefit from lower food competition. Somatic performance seems to be more important than investment in reproduction during the early stages of the invasion process and upstream-directed range expansion is not caused by out-migrating weak or juvenile individuals that were forced to leave high density areas due to high competition. This mechanism might be true for downstream introductions via drift. Greater abundance and densities of acanthocephalan endoparasites were observed at the invasion front, which contradicts the expectation that invasion success is determined by lower parasitic pressure in newly invaded areas. Overall, the pronounced changes in fish and invertebrate communities with a dominance of alien species suggest invasional meltdown and a shift of the upper Danube River towards a novel ecosystem with species that have greater resistance to goby predation.

There were no patterns in δ(15)N or δ(13)C with size in muscle; however, there were indications of seasonal changes in RBC δ(15)N, suggesting short term shifts in diet or behavior is likely linked to reproductive status as is mercury accumulation.","Animals and California and *Environmental Exposure and Environmental Monitoring and Islands and Liver/chemistry and Mercury/*pharmacokinetics and Muscle, Skeletal/chemistry and *Skates, Fish and Water Pollutants/*toxicity",2018/01/18 06:00,S0141-1136(17)30037-5 [pii] and 10.1016/j.marenvres.2017.07.004 [doi],28712829,9882895,0 (Water Pollutants) and FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury),England,Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In South America, the presence of well-developed Prosopis flexuosa woodlands in the Monte Desert region east of the Andes has puzzled scientists for decades. Today these woodlands provide crucial subsistence to local populations, including descendants of the indigenous Huarpes. We explore the vulnerability and importance of phreatic groundwater for the productivity of the region, comparing the contributions of local rainfall to that of remote mountain recharge that is increasingly being diverted for irrigated agriculture before it reaches the desert. We combined deep soil coring, plant measurements, direct water-table observations, and stable-isotopic analyses (2H and 18O) of meteoric, surface, and ground waters at three study sites across the region, comparing woodland stands, bare dunes, and surrounding shrublands. The isotopic composition of phreatic groundwaters (delta2H: -137 per thousand +/- 5 per thousand) closely matched the signature of water brought to the region by the Mendoza River (-137 per thousand +/- 6 per thousand), suggestin that mountain-river infiltration rather than in situ rainfall deep drainage (-39 per thousand +/- 19 per thousand) was the dominant mechanism of recharge. Similarly, chloride mass balances determined from deep soil profiles (> 6 m) suggested very low recharge rates. Vegetation in woodland ecosystems, where significant groundwater discharge losses, likely >100 mm/yr occurred, relied on regionally derived groundwater located from 6.5 to 9.5 m underground. At these locations, daily water-table fluctuations of 10 mm, and stable-isotopic measurements of plant water, indicated groundwater uptake rates of 200-300 mm/yr. Regional scaling suggests that groundwater evapotranspiration reaches 18-42 mm/yr across the landscape, accounting for 7 17% of the Mendoza River flow regionally. Our study highlights the reliance of ecosystem productivity in natural oases on Andean snowmelt, which is increasingly being diverted to one of the largest irrigated regions of the continent.

Although much is known of their feeding preferences from field studies, conclusions, especially in relation to differing habits in wet and dry seasons, are often contradictory. Here, two remote approaches, stable carbon isotope analysis and remote sensing, were combined to investigate dietary changes in relation to tree and grass abundances to better understand elephant dietary choice in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. A composited pair of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite images characterising flushed and senescent vegetation states, typical of wet and dry seasons respectively, were used to generate land-cover maps focusing on the forest to grassland gradient. Stable carbon isotope analysis of elephant faecal samples identified the proportion of C(3) (typically browse)/C(4) (typically grass) in elephant diets in the 1-2 days prior to faecal deposition. The proportion of surrounding C(4) land-cover was extracted using concentric buffers centred on faecal sample locations, and related to the faecal %C(4) content. Results indicate that elephants consume C(4) vegetation in proportion to its availability in the surrounding area during the dry season, but during the rainy season there was less of a relationship between C(4) intake and availability, as elephants targeted grasses in these periods. This study illustrates the utility of coupling isotope and cost-free remote sensing data to conduct complementary landscape analysis at highly-detailed, biologically meaningful resolutions, offering an improved ability to monitor animal behavioural patterns at broad geographical scales.

In this study, we sampled 77 sites along a forest to urban land cover gradient to examine food webs and the use of δ(15)N of periphyton and macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups (FFGs) as indicators of watershed development and nitrogen effects on streams. Functional feeding groups had low δ(15)N variability among taxa within sites.

However, the identity and abundance of coexisting species, the prevailing environmental conditions, and the individual body size may shape the effects of interspecific interactions on species' niche width. Here we study the effects of interspecific and intraspecific interactions, lake area and altitude, and fish body size on the trophic niche width and resource use of a generalist predator, the littoral-dwelling large, sparsely rakered morph of European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus; hereafter LSR whitefish). We use stable isotope, diet and survey fishing data from 14 subarctic lakes along an environmental gradient in northern Norway. The isotopic niche width of LSR whitefish showed a humped-shaped relationship with increasing relative abundance of sympatric competitors, suggesting widest population niche at intermediate intensity of interspecific interactions. The isotopic niche width of LSR whitefish tended to decrease with increasing altitude, suggesting reduced niche in colder, less productive lakes. LSR whitefish typically shifted to a higher trophic position and increased reliance on littoral food resources with increasing body size, although between-lake differences in ontogenetic niche shifts were evident. In most lakes, LSR whitefish relied less on littoral food resources than coexisting fishes and the niche overlap between sympatric competitors was most evident among relatively large individuals (>250 mm). Individual niche variation was highest among >200 mm long LSR whitefish, which likely have escaped the predation window of sympatric predators. We demonstrate that intermediate intensity of interspecific interactions may broaden species' niche width, whereas strong competition for limited resources and high predation risk may suppress niche width in less productive environments. Acknowledging potential humped-shaped relationships between population niche width and interspecific interactions can help us understand species' responses to environmental disturbance (e.g. climate change and species invasions) as well as the driving forces of niche specialization.",Animals and Body Size and Lakes and Predatory Behavior and *Salmonidae/physiology and Sympatry,2022/03/19 06:00,10.1111/1365-2656.13611 [doi],34657292,0376574,NA,England,© 2021 The Authors.

HgT was also lower and δ¹⁵N was higher in all biota from a stream draining a more heavily populated historical lead-zinc mining area than from similar sites with mostly undeveloped forested watersheds. δ¹³C in biota was lowest at spring-influenced sites, reflecting CO₂ inputs and temperature influences, and δ³⁴S increased from south to north in all taxa. However, HgT was not strongly correlated with either δ¹³C or δ³⁴S in biota.

Furthermore, results of this study suggest that the riverine productivity model (RPM) is more appropriate than the widely known river continuum concept (RCC) for the constricted region of this river. These␣conclusions are based on stable isotope analyses of potential sources of organic matter (riparian C(3) trees, riparian C(4) grasses and agricultural crops, submerged macrophytes, benthic filamentous algae, benthic particulate organic matter, and transported organic matter containing detritus and phytoplankton) and various functional feeding groups of invertebrate and fish consumers. The FPC, which stresses the key contribution of organic matter, particularly terrestrial organic matter, originating from the floodplain to riverine food webs, was judged inappropriate for the floodplain region of the Ohio River for hydrodynamic and biotic reasons. The rising limb and peak period of discharge typically occur in November through March when temperatures are low (generally much less than 10°C) and greater than bank-full conditions are relatively unpredictable and short-lived. The major food potentially available to riverine organisms migrating into the floodplain would be decaying vegetation because autotrophic production is temperature and light limited and terrestrial insect production is minimal at that time. It is clear from our data that terrestrial C(4) plants contribute little, if anything, to the consumer food web (based on δ(13)C values), and δ(15)N values for C(3) plants, coarse benthic organic matter, and fine benthic organic matter were too depleted (∼7-12‰ lower than most invertebrate consumer values) for this organic matter to be supporting the food web. The RPM, which emphasizes the primary role of autotrophic production in large rivers, is the most viable of the remaining two ecosystem models for the constricted-channel region of the Ohio based on stable isotope linkage between sources and consumers of organic matter in the food web. The most important form of food web organic matter is apparently transported (suspended) fine (FTOM) and ultra-fine particulate organic matter. We propose that phytoplankton and detritus of an autochthonous origin in the seston would represent a more usable energy source for benthic (bivalve molluscs, hydropsychid caddisflies) and planktonic (microcrustaceans) suspension feeders than the more refractory allochthonous materials derived from upstream processing of terrestrial organic matter. Benthic grazers depend heavily on nonfilamentous benthic algae (based on gut analysis from a separate study), but filamentous benthic algae have no apparent connection to invertebrate consumers (based on δ(13)C values). Amphipod and crayfish show a strong relationship to aquatic macrophytes (possibly through detrital organic matter rather than living plant tissue). These observations contrast with the prediction of the RCC that food webs in large rivers are based principally on refractory FTOM and dissolved organic matter from upstream inefficiencies in organic-matter processing and the bacteria growing upon these suspended or dissolved detrital compounds.

Epub and 2022 Mar 16.,303,1873-6424 (Electronic) and 0269-7491 (Linking),119165,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and a recent shift toward emerging PFAS is calling for new data on their occurrence and fate. In particular, understanding the determinants of their bioaccumulation is fundamental for risk assessment purposes. However, very few studies have addressed the combined influence of potential ecological drivers of PFAS bioaccumulation in fish such as age, sex or trophic ecology. Thus, this work aimed to fill these knowledge gaps by performing a field study in the Seine River basin (France). Composite sediment and fish (European chub, Squalius Cephalus) samples were collected from four sites along a longitudinal transect to investigate the occurrence of 36 PFAS. Sediment molecular patterns were dominated by fluorotelomer sulfonamidoalkyl betaines (i.e. 6:2 and 8:2 FTAB, 46% of ∑PFAS on average), highlighting the non-negligible contribution of PFAS of emerging concern. C(9)-C(14) perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) and 10:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (10:2 FTSA) were detected in all fish samples. Conversely, 8:2 FTAB was detected in a few fish from the furthest downstream station only, suggesting the low bioaccessibility or the biotransformation of FTABs. ∑PFAS in fish was in the range 0.22-3.8 ng g(-1) wet weight (ww) and 11-140 ng g(-1) ww for muscle and liver, respectively. Fish collected upstream of Paris were significantly less contaminated than those collected downstream, pointing to urban and industrial inputs. The influence of trophic ecology and biometry on the interindividual variability of PFAS burden in fish was examined through analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs), with sampling site considered as a categorical variable. While the latter was highly significant, diet was also influential; carbon sources and trophic level (i.e. estimated using C and N stable isotope ratios, respectively) equally explained the variability of PFAS levels in fish.","*Alkanesulfonic Acids/analysis and Animals and Bioaccumulation and *Cyprinidae and Environmental Monitoring and *Fluorocarbons/analysis and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis",2022/04/13 06:00,S0269-7491(22)00379-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119165 [doi],35306089,8804476,"0 (Alkanesulfonic Acids) and 0 (Fluorocarbons) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)",England,Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) can be chronically exposed to PAEs by ingesting plastic debris, but no information is available about PAEs levels in blood, and how these concentrations are related to diet during different life stages. This paper investigated, for the first time, six PAEs in blood of 18 wild-caught Mediterranean loggerhead turtles throughout solid-phase extraction coupled with gas chromatography-ion trap/mass spectrometry. Stable isotope analyses of carbon and nitrogen were also performed to assess the resource use pattern of loggerhead turtles. DEHP (12-63 ng mL(-1)) and DBP (6-57 ng mL(-1)) were the most frequently represented PAEs, followed by DiBP, DMP, DEP and DOP. The total PAEs concentration was highest in three turtles (124-260 ng mL(-1)) whereas three other turtles had concentrations below the detection limit. PAEs were clustered in three groups according to concentration in all samples: DEHP in the first group, DBP, DEP, and DiBP in the second group, and DOP and DMP in the third group. The total phthalates concentration did not differ between large-sized (96.3 ± 86.0 ng mL(-1)) and small-sized (67.1 ± 34.2 ng mL(-1)) turtles (p < 0.001). However, DMP and DEP were found only in large-sized turtles and DiBP and DBP had higher concentrations in large-sized turtles. On the other hand, DEHP and DOP were found in both small- and large-sized turtles with similar concentrations, i.e. ~ 21.0/32.0 ng mL(-1) and ~ 7(.1)/9.9 ng mL(-1), respectively. Winsored robust models indicated that δ(13)C is a good predictor for DBP and DiBP concentrations (significant Akaike Information criterion weight, AIC(wt)). Our results indicate that blood is a good matrix to evaluate acute exposure to PAEs in marine turtles. Moreover, this approach is here suggested as a useful tool to explain the internal dose of PAEs in term of dietary habits (δ(13)C), suggesting that all marine species at high trophic levels may be particularly exposed to PAEs, despite their different dietary habitats and levels of exposure.",Animals and Diet and *Diethylhexyl Phthalate/analysis and Ecosystem and Esters/analysis and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and *Phthalic Acids/analysis and *Turtles,2022/08/09 06:00,S0147-6513(22)00459-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113619 [doi],35605320,7805381,0 (Esters) and 0 (Phthalic Acids) and 6O7F7IX66E (phthalic acid) and C42K0PH13C (Diethylhexyl Phthalate),Netherlands,Copyright © 2022.

This effect is particularly evident on shores where organisms with aquatic larval stages enter the terrestrial food web. The identities of such trophic links are not easily estimated as spiders, a dominant group of shoreline predator, have external digestion. We compared trophic links and the prey diversity of spiders on different shore types along the Baltic Sea: on open shores and on shores with a reed belt bordering the water. A priori, we hypothesized that the physical structure of the shoreline reduces the flow between ecosystem and the subsidies across the sea-land interface. To circumvent the lack of morphologically detectable remains of spider prey, we used a combination of stable isotope and molecular gut content analyses. The two tools used for diet analysis revealed complementary information on spider diets. The stable isotope analysis indicated that spiders on open shores had a marine signal of carbon isotopes, while spiders on reedy shores had a terrestrial signal. The molecular analysis revealed a diverse array of dipteran and lepidopteran prey, where spiders on open and reedy shores shared a similar diet with a comparable proportion of chironomids, the larvae of which live in the marine system. Comparing the methods suggests that differences in isotope composition of the two spider groups occurred because of differences in the chironomid diets: as larvae, chironomids of reedy shores likely fed on terrestrial detritus and acquired a terrestrial isotope signature, while chironomids of open shores utilized an algal diet and acquired a marine isotope signature. Our results illustrate how different methods of diet reconstruction may shed light on complementary aspects of nutrient transfer. Overall, they reveal that reed belts can reduce connectivity between habitats, but also function as a source of food for predators.",NA,2016/12/30 06:01,ECE32536 [pii] and 10.1002/ece3.2536 [doi],28031795,101566408,NA,England,NA,10.1002/ece3.2536 [doi],Baltic Sea and DNA barcoding and Pardosa and chironomids and stable isotope analysis,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,PMC5167037,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A potential alternative method for tracing P uptake in plant-soil systems relies on the analysis of the stable oxygen (O) isotopes of ortho-phosphate (Pi); however, little is known about the fate of the P-O bond during Pi uptake in AM symbioses. This study investigated whether the abundance of (18)O in Pi extracted from the shoots of maize increased after (18)O-labeled Pi added to soil was taken up by either roots of maize or AM extraradical hyphae. A two-compartment culture system, consisting of a root and AM hyphal compartment (RHC, including both roots and AM hyphae) and an AM hyphal compartment (HC, including only hyphae) was designed, and the AM fungus Funneliformis mosseae was used to inoculate the roots of maize. Our results indicated that the abundance of (18)O in Pi extracted from the maize shoots increased significantly 3 months after the addition of (18)O-labeled Pi to the soil in the pots which only contained roots. The abundance of (18)O was much lower than expected, however, which suggests a great majority of (18)O in labeled Pi was lost in the soil or during Pi metabolism in the shoots of maize. The abundance of (18)O in Pi extracted from the maize shoots did not increase 3 months after (18)O-labeled Pi was added to the HC, and therefore, loss of (18)O in labeled Pi may also occur during Pi metabolism in AM hyphae.

Many nuclear facilities, including power reactors, release 14C into the environment, and much of this is as 14CO2. This mixes readily with stable CO2, and hence enters the food chain as fundamental biomolecules. This isotopic mixing is often used as the basis for dose assessment models. The present model was developed for the situation of 14C releases to surface waters, where there are distinct changes in the water 14C activity concentrations throughout the year. Complete isotopic mixing (equilibrium) cannot be assumed. The model computes the specific activity (activity of 14C per mass of total C) in water, phytoplankton, fish, crops, meat, milk and air, following a typical irrigation-based food-chain scenario. For most of the biotic compartments, the specific activity is a function of the specific activity in the previous time step, the specific activity of the substrate media, and the C turnover rate in the tissue. The turnover rate is taken to include biochemical turnover, growth dilution and mortality, recognizing that it is turnover of C in the population, not a tissue or an individual, that is relevant. Attention is paid to the incorporation of 14C into the surface water biota and the loss of any remaining 14CO2 from the surface water-air interface under its own activity concentration gradient. For certain pathways, variants in the conceptual model are presented, in order to fully discuss the possibilities. As an example, a new model of the soil-to-plant specific activity relationship is proposed, where the degassing of both 14C and stable C from the soil is considered. Selection of parameter values to represent the turnover rates as modeled is important, and is dealt with in a companion paper.","Air Pollution, Radioactive/*adverse effects and Animals and Biodiversity and Carbon Dioxide/analysis/metabolism and Carbon Radioisotopes/*analysis/metabolism and Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation and *Environmental Monitoring and Food Contamination, Radioactive/*analysis and Humans and Kinetics and Milk/metabolism/radiation effects and Models, Biological and Plants, Edible/metabolism/radiation effects and Risk Assessment and Temperature and Water Pollution, Radioactive/*adverse effects and Zooplankton/metabolism/radiation effects",2006/09/06 09:00,S0265-931X(05)00292-4 [pii] and 10.1016/j.jenvrad.2005.10.007 [doi],16375996,8508119,0 (Carbon Radioisotopes) and 142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide),England,NA,NA,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The factors governing the exchange of plant C for fungal N, however, remain obscure. Because competition and soil resources may influence ectomycorrhizal resource movement, we performed a 10-month split-root microcosm study using Pinus muricata seedlings with Thelephora terrestris, Suillus pungens, or no ectomycorrhizal fungus, under two N concentrations in artificial soil. Fungi competed directly with roots and indirectly with each other. We used stable isotope enrichment to track plant photosynthate and fungal N. For T. terrestris, plants received N commensurate with the C given to their fungal partners. Thelephora terrestris was a superior mutualist under high-N conditions. For S. pungens, plant C and fungal N exchange were not coupled. However, in low-N conditions, plants preferentially allocated C to S. pungens rather than T. terrestris. Our results suggest that ectomycorrhizal resource transfer depends on competitive and nutritional context.

Previous work demonstrating the negative impacts of AgNP exposure on periphyton production suggests benthic primary production could be reduced in aquatic ecosystems impacted by AgNP discharge. To evaluate the potential for AgNPs to alter benthic-pelagic coupling in aquatic ecosystems, tissue-stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen from northern pike (Esox lucius) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were measured before, during, and after the addition of AgNPs to a whole-lake ecosystem, and compared to those collected from a nearby reference lake. A shift in carbon isotope ratios toward more negative values was observed in both P. flavescens and E. lucius collected from the lake where AgNPs were added, with no shift in similar magnitude observed in E. lucius from the reference lake. Consequently, Bayesian estimates of benthic energy consumed decreased by 32% for P. flavescens and by 40% for E. lucius collected after AgNP additions relative to pre-addition estimates, greater in magnitude or opposite in direction of trends observed in our reference lake. Analyses suggest no changes in fish nitrogen isotope ratios related to AgNP additions. We hypothesize that the observed reduction in littoral energy use of fish reported here is a response to AgNP settling in littoral benthic habitats-the main habitat in lakes supporting periphyton-as AgNP has been shown elsewhere to significantly reduce the rates of periphyton production. Further, our study highlights the need to broaden the scope of risk assessments for AgNPs and other emerging contaminants prone to settling to consider habitat-specific impacts on resource utilization by organisms after their release into aquatic ecosystems.",NA,2023/08/19 11:42,10.1111/jfb.15526 [doi],37596683,0214055,NA,England,© 2023 The Authors.

Omnivores in different habitats can potentially change their feeding behaviour and alter their trophic position and role according to habitat conditions. Here we examine the trophic level and diet of the omnivorous signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) in gradients of trophic status and lake size, both of which have been previously suggested to affect trophic position of predators separately or combined as productive space. We found the trophic position of omnivorous crayfish to be positively correlated with lake trophic status, but found no evidence for any influence of lake size or productive space on crayfish trophic position. The higher trophic position of crayfish in eutrophic lakes was largely caused by a shift in crayfish diet and not by an increase in trophic links in basal parts of the food web. Hence, our results support the ""productivity hypothesis,"" suggesting that food chains can be longer in more productive systems. Furthermore, stable isotope data indicated that larger crayfish are more predatory than smaller crayfish in lakes with wider littoral zones. Wider littoral zones promoted the development of intrapopulation differences in trophic position whereas narrow littoral zones did not.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether Northern gannets (Morus bassanus) from the largest colony in North America (Bonaventure Island, Quebec, Canada) were in negative nutritional state during the unprecedented low reproductive success year of 2012, and whether this was associated with changes in SST anomalies and diet. The incubation period of gannets in 2012 was characterized by a significant decline, from early to late incubation, in plasma triglyceride levels that was associated with an increase in plasma corticosterone levels. However, no changes in plasma glycerol and β-hydroxybutyrate levels were noted. SST anomalies recorded in this area (south of the Gulf of St. Lawrence) during the breeding period were consistently higher in 2012 compared to the previous year (a better reproductive success year). Based on signatures of stable carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotopes in gannet red blood cells and in whole fish homogenates of three major preys (mackerel, herring, and capelin), a minor dietary shift was noted between those years and incubation periods. In light of these findings, it is suggested that the extreme warm-water perturbation event that prevailed in the Gulf of St. Lawrence during summer 2012 was associated with a rapid deterioration of nutritional condition of Bonaventure Island gannets during the incubation. These suboptimal physiological changes likely contributed to the dramatic decline in reproductive success reported in this colony.","3-Hydroxybutyric Acid/blood and *Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena and Animals and Atlantic Ocean and Birds/*physiology and Climate Change and Corticosterone/blood and Female and Fishes and Genetic Fitness and Glycerol/blood and Male and Nutritional Status and Predatory Behavior and Quebec and Reproduction and Stress, Physiological and Triglycerides/blood",2015/10/27 06:00,S1095-6433(14)00248-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.cbpa.2014.11.017 [doi],25449633,9806096,0 (Triglycerides) and PDC6A3C0OX (Glycerol) and TZP1275679 (3-Hydroxybutyric Acid) and W980KJ009P (Corticosterone),United States,Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We present the first dietary and environmental reconstructions in Northeastern Thailand, using stable isotope abundances in mammalian tooth enamel from the late Middle Pleistocene locality, Tham Wiman Nakin (Snake Cave), which reflect a much higher (over 70%) than modern (13%) occurrence of C4 plants. Bovids and cervids appear to have had almost entirely a C4 plant diet. Carnivores consumed a mixture of C3 (suids) and C4 (bovids, cervids) consumers. Rhinoceroses and orangutan appear to have maintained their preference through time for forested or open C3 environment, respectively. (13)C/(12)C from bone bioapatite, horn and hair of modern Southeast Asian mammals almost exclusively demonstrate C3 vegetation dominance. C4 consumption is rare in analysed modern species and it could be related to anthropogenic influences such as ingestion of domestic crops or livestock. Interesting implications emerge in the C4 vegetation distribution in southern Eurasian ecosystems, indicating that Southeast Asia, south of the Tibet, could be part of the global C4 vegetation spread, which occurred around 7 Ma. However, the C4 percentage in ecosystems varied geographically. Despite modern reversal towards C3 habitats due to factors such as increasing CO(2), we think that anthropological influences may be responsible for habitat and dietary changes in extant species. Bovids demonstrate the most significant shift in diet and habitat through time, from C4-dominated open habitats to C3-dominated habitats indicative of dense forest understory.","Altitude and Animal Feed and Animals and Carbon Isotopes/analysis and Carnivora and Ecosystem and Elephants and Environment and *Fossils and Geography and Hyaenidae and Mammals/*classification and Paleontology/methods and Plants, Edible and Ruminants and Seasons and Swine and Thailand and Trees and Tropical Climate",2010/05/06 06:00,10.1007/s00114-009-0642-6 [doi],20127068,0400767,0 (Carbon Isotopes),Germany,NA,10.1007/s00114-009-0642-6 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Traditionally, however, prey abundance (i.e., zooplankton density) has been considered important, whereas prey nutritional composition has been largely neglected in natural settings. High-quality zooplankton, rich in both essential amino acids (EAAs) and fatty acids (FAs), are required as starting prey to initiate development and fast juvenile growth. Prey quality is dependent on environmental conditions, and, for example, eutrophication and browning are two major factors defining primary producer community structures that will directly determine the nutritional quality of the basal food sources (algae, bacteria, terrestrial matter) for zooplankton. We experimentally tested how eutrophication and browning affect the growth and survival of juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by changing the quality of basal resources. We fed the fish on herbivorous zooplankton (Daphnia) grown with foods of different nutritional quality (algae, bacteria, terrestrial matter), and used GC-MS, stable isotope labeling as well as bulk and compound-specific stable isotope analyses for detecting the effects of different diets on the nutritional status of fish. The content of EAAs and omega-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) in basal foods and zooplankton decreased in both eutrophication and browning treatments. The decrease in ω-3 PUFA and especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was reflected to fish juveniles, but they were able to compensate for low availability of EAAs in their food. Therefore, the reduced growth and survival of the juvenile fish was linked to the low availability of DHA. Fish showed very low ability to convert alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to DHA.

The challenge grows from the uncertainty of N cycle responses and the extent to which shifts in soil N are coupled with the C cycle and productivity of tundra systems. We used a long-term (since 2003) experiment of summer warming and supplemental summer water additions to a High Arctic ecosystem in NW Greenland, and applied a combination of discrete sampling and in situ soil core incubations to measure C and N pools and seasonal microbial processes that might control plant-available N. We hypothesized that elevated temperature and increased precipitation would stimulate microbial activity and net inorganic N mineralization, thereby increasing plant N-availability through the growing season. While we did find increased N mineralization rates under both global change scenarios, water addition also significantly increased net nitrification rates, loss of NO3 (-) -N via leaching, and lowered rates of labile organic N production. We also expected the chronic warming and watering would lead to long-term changes in soil N-cycling that would be reflected in soil δ(15) N values. We found that soil δ(15) N decreased under the different climate change scenarios. Our results suggest that temperature accelerates biological processes and existing C and N transformations, but moisture increases soil hydraulic connectivity and so alters the pathways, and changes the fate of the products of C and N transformations. In addition, our findings indicate that warmer, wetter High Arctic tundra will be cycling N and C in ways that may transform these landscapes in part leading to greater C sequestration, but simultaneously, N losses from the upper soil profile that may be transported to depth dissolved in water and or transported off site in lateral flow.","Arctic Regions and Carbon/analysis and Fluorides, Topical and Greenland and Nitrogen/*analysis/metabolism and Plant Leaves/chemistry and Rain and Rosaceae and Salix and Soil/*chemistry and *Soil Microbiology and Temperature and Water/analysis",2014/05/20 06:00,10.1111/gcb.12318 [doi],23843128,9888746,"0 (Carex) and 0 (Fluorides, Topical) and 0 (Soil) and 059QF0KO0R (Water) and 7440-44-0 (Carbon) and N762921K75 (Nitrogen)",England,© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,10.1111/gcb.12318 [doi],carbon and climate change and global warming and mineralization and nitrification and nitrogen and polar semidesert and precipitation and stable isotopes,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The gradual input of Atlantic prey in kittiwake diet could have resulted in a decrease in Hg concentrations until 2013.

Tree masting is a common resource pulse in terrestrial ecosystems that can drive rodent population cycles. Using stable isotope (δ(13)C, δ(15)N) analyses, we investigated the dietary response of two fluctuating rodent species, the yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis and the bank vole Myodes glareolus, to mast events in Białowieża Forest (NE Poland). Rodent hair samples were obtained non-invasively from faeces of their predators for an 11-year period that encompassed two mast events. Spectacular seed crops of deciduous trees, namely oak Quercus robur and hornbeam Carpinus betulus, occur after several intermediate years of moderate seed production, with a post-mast year characterised by a nil crop. While a Bayesian isotopic (SIAR) mixing model showed a variety of potential vegetation inputs to rodent diets, the isotopic niche of the yellow-necked mouse was strongly associated with mast of deciduous trees (>80% of diet), showing no variation among years of different seed crop. However, bank voles showed a strong functional response; in mast years the vole shifted its diet from herbs in deciduous forest (~66% of diet) to mast (~74%). Only in mast years did the isotopic niche of both rodent species overlap. Previous research showed that bank voles, subordinate and more generalist than mice, showed higher fluctuations in numbers in response to masting.

However, a mechanistic understanding of how leaf morphological/physiological traits effect δ (E) is missing. A laser spectrometer was coupled to a leaf-level gas-exchange system to measure fluxes and isotopic signatures of plant transpiration under controlled conditions in seven distinct species (Fagus sylvatica, Pinus sylvestris, Acacia longifolia, Quercus suber, Coffea arabica, Plantago lanceolata, Oxalis triangularis). We analyzed the role of stomatal conductance (g(s) ) and leaf water content (W) on the temporal dynamics of δ (E) following changes in relative humidity (rH). Changes in rH were applied from 60 to 30% and from 30 to 60%, which is probably more than covering the maximum step changes occurring under natural conditions. Further, the impact of g(s) and W on isotopic non-steady state isofluxes was analyzed. Following changes in rH, temporal development of δ (E) was well described by a one-pool modeling approach for most species. Isofluxes of δ (E) were dominantly driven by stomatal control on E, particularly for the initial period of 30 min following a step change. Hence, the deviation of isofluxes from isotopic steady state can be large, even though plants transpire near to isotopic steady state. Notably, not only transpiration rate and stomatal conductance, but also the leaf traits stomatal density (as a measure of g(max)) and leaf water content are significantly related to the time constant (τ) and non-steady-state isofluxes.

The abundant and widespread unicellular cyanobacteria group A (UCYN-A) has recently been found to live symbiotically with a haptophyte. Here, we investigated the effect of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), iron (Fe) and Saharan dust additions on nitrogen (N2) fixation and primary production by the UCYN-A-haptophyte association in the subtropical eastern North Atlantic Ocean using nifH expression analysis and stable isotope incubations combined with single-cell measurements. N2 fixation by UCYN-A was stimulated by the addition of Fe and Saharan dust, although this was not reflected in the nifH expression. CO2 fixation by the haptophyte was stimulated by the addition of ammonium nitrate as well as Fe and Saharan dust. Intriguingly, the single-cell analysis using nanometer scale secondary ion mass spectrometry indicates that the increased CO2 fixation by the haptophyte in treatments without added fixed N is likely an indirect result of the positive effect of Fe and/or P on UCYN-A N2 fixation and the transfer of N2-derived N to the haptophyte. Our results reveal a direct linkage between the marine carbon and nitrogen cycles that is fuelled by the atmospheric deposition of dust. The comparison of single-cell rates suggests a tight coupling of nitrogen and carbon transfer that stays balanced even under changing nutrient regimes. However, it appears that the transfer of carbon from the haptophyte to UCYN-A requires a transfer of nitrogen from UCYN-A. This tight coupling indicates an obligate symbiosis of this globally important diazotrophic association.","Africa, Northern and Atlantic Ocean and Carbon/chemistry/*metabolism and Dust and Ecosystem and Haptophyta/*metabolism and Nitrates and Nitrogen/chemistry/*metabolism and Nitrogen Fixation/*physiology and Phosphorus/metabolism and Seawater/chemistry/microbiology and Symbiosis",2016/02/26 06:00,ismej2014253 [pii] and 10.1038/ismej.2014.253 [doi],25535939,101301086,0 (Dust) and 0 (Nitrates) and 27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus) and 7440-44-0 (Carbon) and N762921K75 (Nitrogen) and T8YA51M7Y6 (ammonium nitrate),England,NA,10.1038/ismej.2014.253 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC4478704,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we present sedimentary multi-proxies records (i.e. chironomids, elements and stable isotope of carbon and nitrogen) in (210)Pb-dated cores from two montane ponds (central China). Before the 1900s, low biomass and the dominance of opportunistic species (e.g. Chironomus anthracinus-type) in both ponds might be in response to cold and harsh condition. Thereafter, chironomid communities in both ponds experienced pronounced shifts. Nutrient-tolerant/warm-adapted species (e.g. Chironomus sp., Polypedilum nubeculosum-type and Endochironomus impar-type) proliferated and biomass increased synchronously after the 1900s, suggestive of favorable condition for chironomid growth. Redundancy analyses revealed that changes in chironomid communities in both ponds were significantly correlated with rising temperature and δ(15)N depletion. Prolonged growing season and nitrogen subsidy would increase primary productivity, and hence enhancing food availability for chironomids. Catchment-mediated indirect effects of warming and nitrogen deposition, such as hydrological changes and terrestrial organic matter inputs, would impose further influences on chironomid communities.

These changes will impact on the dynamics of riverine carbon cycles and food web structure and function. Here we investigate the principal sources of organic carbon supporting local shredder communities across a gradient in different levels of anthropogenic development along riverine reaches, in South Australia. In forested/wooded reaches with minimum to limited development, semi-emergent macrophytes were the principal sources of organic carbon supporting the local shredder communities. However, in developed reaches, course particulate organic matter and filamentous algae were the principal food sources. The C:N ratios of the food sources in developed reaches were higher than those of their consumers indicating a stoichiometric mismatch.

These allochthonous inputs regulate many ecosystem characteristics. In inland waters, terrestrial inputs of organic matter regulate food-web structure, ecosystem metabolism, water clarity, and thermal stratification. Future changes in allochthony may be especially pronounced in high-elevation ecosystems due to increases in vegetation and precipitation associated with climate change. Several techniques exist to characterize the degree of allochthony of organic matter in aquatic systems, including metrics such as ΔH, the net isotopic discrimination between water and particulate organic matter (POM) of deuterium stable isotopes, and the fluorescence index (FI), which characterizes the fluorescence of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Despite the importance of allochthonous organic carbon inputs, little is known about either how allochthony varies across elevation gradients or whether different metrics are similarly related to allochthony. We measured AH, FI, and a suite of related water-quality characteristics in 30 lakes across a montane to alpine elevation gradient (2340 to 3205 m) in the Beartooth Mountains of Montana and Wyoming, USA, to understand how FI and AH varied with elevation, with one another, and with other allochthony-related water-quality characteristics. We hypothesized that allochthony of POM and DOM would decrease at higher elevations, with alpine lakes above treeline being more autochthonous compared with low-elevation lakes below treeline. We observed a significant inverse linear relationship between AH and Fl, with both metrics indicating a decrease in allochthony at higher elevations. Characteristics including the natural log of the ratio of concentrations of dissolved organic carbon to chlorophyll a (ln(DOC: Chl)), the spectral slope ratio between different spectra of two wavebands (SR, ratio of spectra at 275-295 to 350-400 nm), and a ratio of diffuse attenuation coefficients at 320 and 380 nm (KR, Kd320: Kd380) varied with both ΔH and FI while pH varied only with ΔH. High-elevation systems were characterized by low ln(DOC: Chl) and K(R), and high S(R) and pH. These results indicate that high-elevation lakes are more autochthonous than low-elevation lakes.

Lake trout were also collected from three isolated lake systems (Lakes Nipigon, Simcoe and Opeongo), all located within the basin. All the samples were analysed for body burdens of total toxaphene and 22 toxaphene congeners. In addition, from each of the Great Lakes sites samples of major invertebrate dietary items, which included Mysis relicta, Diporeia hoyi and plankton, were similarly analysed.

Its oxidation performed by syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogens is considered to be a rate-limiting step for methane production. However, the current understanding of SPOB is limited due to the difficulty of pure culture isolation. In the present study, two anaerobic chemostats fed with propionate as the sole carbon source were operated at different dilution rates (0.05 d(-1) and 0.15 d(-1)). The propionate- and acetate-oxidizing bacteria in the two methanogenic chemostats were investigated combining DNA-stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) and 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing. The results of DNA-SIP with (13)C-propionate/acetate suggested that, Smithella, Syntrophobacter, Cryptanaerobacter, and unclassified Rhodospirillaceae may be putative propionate-oxidizing bacteria; unclassified Spirochaetaceae, unclassified Synergistaceae, unclassified Elusimicrobia, Mesotoga, and Gracilibacter may contribute to acetate oxidation; unclassified Syntrophaceae and Syntrophomonas may be butyrate oxidizers. By DNA-SIP, unclassified OTUs with 16S rRNA gene abundance higher than 62% of total Bacteria in the PL chemostat and 38% in the PH chemostat were revealed to be related to the degradation of propionate. These results suggest that a variety of uncultured bacteria contribute to propionate degradation during anaerobic digestion.

For approving a chemical within the EU, producers need to conduct an environmental risk assessment, which typically relies on data generated under laboratory conditions without considering the ecological and landscape context. To address this gap and add information on emerging contaminants and chemical mixtures, we analysed 30 livers of white-tailed sea eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) from northern Germany with high resolution-mass spectrometry coupled to liquid and gas chromatography for the identification of >2400 contaminants. We then modelled the influence of trophic position (δ(15)N), habitat (δ(13)C) and landscape on chemical residues and screened for persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) properties using an in silico model to unravel mismatches between predicted PBT properties and observed exposures. Despite having generally low PBT scores, most detected contaminants were medicinal products with oxfendazole and salicylamide being most frequent. Chemicals of the Stockholm Convention such as 4,4'-DDE and PCBs were present in all samples below toxicity thresholds. Among PFAS, especially PFOS showed elevated concentrations compared to other studies. In contrast, PFCA levels were low and increased with δ(15)N, which indicated an increase with preying on piscivorous species. Among plant protection products, spiroxamine and simazine were frequently detected with increasing concentrations in agricultural landscapes. The in silico model has proven to be reliable for predicting PBT properties for most chemicals. However, chemical exposures in apex predators are complex and do not solely rely on intrinsic chemical properties but also on other factors such as ecology and landscape. We therefore recommend that ecological contexts, mixture toxicities, and chemical monitoring data should be more frequently considered in regulatory risk assessments, e.g. in a weight of evidence approach, to trigger risk management measures before adverse effects in individuals or populations start to manifest.",Animals and Bioaccumulation and *Eagles and Environmental Monitoring and Humans and *Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis and Risk Assessment,2022/01/08 06:00,S0160-4120(21)00559-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envint.2021.106934 [doi],34662799,7807270,DFC2HB4I0K (Polychlorinated Biphenyls),Netherlands,Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

However, particularly in streams, microbial functions vary significantly with the structure of the streambed, that is the distribution and spatial arrangement of sediment grains in the streambed. It is therefore essential to elucidate how environmental factors synergistically define the microbial turnover of terrestrial organic matter in order to better understand the ecological role of photo-heterotrophic interactions in stream ecosystem processes. In outdoor experimental streams, we examined how the structure of streambeds modifies the influence of light availability on microbial turnover of leaf carbon (C). Furthermore, we investigated whether the studied relationships of microbial leaf C turnover to environmental conditions are affected by flow intermittency commonly occurring in streams. We applied leaves enriched with a (13)C-stable isotope tracer and combined quantitative and isotope analyses. We thereby elucidated whether treatment induced changes in C turnover were associated with altered use of leaf C within the microbial food web. Moreover, isotope analyses were combined with measurements of microbial community composition to determine whether changes in community function were associated with a change in community composition. In this study, we present evidence, that environmental factors interactively determine how phototrophs and heterotrophs contribute to leaf C turnover. Light availability promoted the utilization of leaf C within the microbial food web, which was likely associated with a promoted availability of highly bioavailable metabolites of phototrophic origin. However, our results additionally confirm that the structure of the streambed modifies light-related changes in microbial C turnover. From our observations, we conclude that the streambed structure influences the strength of photo-heterotrophic interactions by defining the spatial availability of algal metabolites in the streambed and the composition of microbial communities.

Arthropod populations in turn are influenced by climate because temperature affects survival and reproduction, and larval development. Thus, climate factors have the potential to influence many bird species during their reproductive phases. In this study, we assessed climate factors that impact the diet of nestling White-headed Woodpecker (Dryobates albolarvatus), an at-risk keystone species in much of its range in western North America. To do this, we measured stable isotope signatures (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) in 152 nestlings across six years and linked variation in isotopic values to winter (December-February) and spring (June) precipitation and temperature using mixed effects models. We also explored habitat factors that may impact δ(13)C and δ(15)N and the relationship between δ(15)N and nest productivity. Last, we estimated isotopic niche width for nestlings in different watersheds and years using Bayesian standard ellipses, which allowed us to compare dietary niche width and overlap. We found that colder winter temperatures were associated with an increase in δ(15)N and δ(15)N levels had a weak positive relationship with nest productivity. We also found that sites with a more diverse tree community were associated with a broader isotopic niche width in nestlings. Our findings suggest that nestling diet is affected by climate, and under future warming climate scenarios, White-headed Woodpecker nestling diet may shift in favor of lower trophic level prey (prey with lower δ(15)N levels).

In needles, the highest allocation occurred not only into the WSOC pool (44.1% of recovered needle (13)C) but also into stOC (33.9%). Needle growth, however, also caused high (13)C allocation into pathways not involved in the formation of structural compounds: (i) pathways in secondary metabolism, (ii) C-1 metabolism and (iii) amino acid synthesis from photorespiration. These pathways could be identified by a high (13)C enrichment of their key amino acids. In addition, (13)C was strongly allocated into the n-alkyl lipid fraction (0.3% of recovered (13)C), whereby (13)C allocation into cellular and cuticular exceeded that of epicuticular fatty acids. (13)C allocation decreased along the lipid transformation and translocation pathways: the allocation was highest for precursor fatty acids, lower for elongated fatty acids and lowest for the decarbonylated n-alkanes. The combination of (13)C pulse labelling with compound-specific (13)C analysis of key metabolites enabled tracing relevant C allocation pathways under field conditions.

Such human-modified ecosystems have been associated with emerging infectious diseases, threatening human and animal health. However, human disturbance also creates new resources that some species can exploit. Common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) in Latin America constitute an important example, as their adaptation to human-modified habitats and livestock blood-feeding has implications for e.g., rabies transmission. Despite the well-known links between habitat degradation and disease emergence, few studies have explored how human-induced disturbance influences wildlife behavioural ecology and health, which can alter disease dynamics. To evaluate links among habitat disturbance, diet shifts, gut microbiota, and immunity, we quantified disturbance around roosting caves of common vampire bats in Costa Rica, measured their long-term diet preferences (livestock or wildlife blood) using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, evaluated innate and adaptive immune markers, and characterized their gut microbiota. We observed that bats from roosting caves with more cattle farming nearby fed more on cattle blood. Moreover, gut microbial richness and the abundance of specific gut microbes differed according to feeding preferences. Interestingly, bats feeding primarily on wildlife blood harboured a higher abundance of the bacteria Edwardsiella sp., which tended to be associated with higher immunoglobulin G levels. Our results highlight how human land-use change may indirectly affect wildlife health and emerging infectious diseases through diet-induced shifts in microbiota, with implications for host immunity and potential consequences for susceptibility to pathogens.","Humans and Animals and Cattle and Ecosystem and *Chiroptera and *Gastrointestinal Microbiome and *Communicable Diseases, Emerging and *Rabies and Livestock and Animals, Wild",2023/11/22 06:43,S0048-9697(23)06442-2 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167815 [doi],37852483,0330500,NA,Netherlands,Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Animals relying mostly on stored reserves are termed 'capital breeders', whereas 'income breeders' rely mostly on concurrent intake when financing the costs of reproduction. The role and adaptive value of individual variation in these strategies remain elusive. Life-history theory posits that capital breeding should be favoured when offspring reproductive value peaks, typically occurring early in the season, and that current income should increasingly be used with progressing season. Because resource limitation may hamper flexible resource allocation, a corollary prediction is that only good-condition individuals may show the expected seasonal shift in resource use. To test this prediction, we examined stable isotopes (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) in blood and lipid-free egg yolk of breeding eider females (Somateria mollissima) from the Baltic Sea to assess the role of individual variation in the use of proteins from local diet vs. stored reserves. RESULTS: We show for the first time that individuals from a single population differ in their utilization of stored reserves and concurrent intake to finance the costs of reproduction.

Despite this, stem growth rates were similar to today. Using a coupled light-use efficiency and tree growth model, we show that it is possible to maintain a stable c(i)/c(a) ratio because both vapour pressure deficit and temperature were decreased under glacial conditions at La Brea, and these have compensating effects on the c(i)/c(a) ratio. Reduced photorespiration at lower temperatures would partly mitigate the effect of low c(i) on gross primary production, but maintenance of present-day radial growth also requires a ~27% reduction in the ratio of fine root mass to leaf area. Such a shift was possible due to reduced drought stress under glacial conditions at La Brea. The necessity for changes in allocation in response to changes in [CO(2)] is consistent with increased below-ground allocation, and the apparent homoeostasis of radial growth, as c(a) increases today.","*Biomass and California and Carbon Dioxide/*metabolism and *Climate and Models, Biological and Trees/*metabolism",2018/12/19 06:00,srep43087 [pii] and 10.1038/srep43087 [doi],28233772,101563288,142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide),England,NA,10.1038/srep43087 [doi] and 43087,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC5324044,The authors declare no competing financial interests.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

After UV radiation, we measured the re-brooding success, growth pattern of newly hatched nauplii, ingestion rate, and assimilation of diet. In addition, we checked the modulated patterns of DNA repair and heat shock protein (hsp) chaperoning genes of P. nana. UV-B radiation induced a significant reduction (7-87%) of the re-brooding rate of ovigerous females, indicating that UV-induced egg sac damage is closely correlated with a reduction in the hatching rate of UV-irradiated ovigerous female offspring. Using chlorophyll a and stable carbon isotope incubation experiments, we found a dose-dependent decrease (P<0.05) in food ingestion and the rate of assimilation to the body in response to UV radiation, implying that P. nana has an underlying ability to shift its balanced-energy status from growth and reproduction to DNA repair and adaptation. Also, expression of P. nana base excision repair (BER)-associated genes and hsp chaperoning genes was significantly increased in response to UV radiation in P. nana. These findings indicate that even 1kJ/m(2) of UV radiation induces a reduction in reproduction and growth patterns, alters the physiological balance and inhibits the ability to cope with UV-induced damage in P. nana.","Animals and Copepoda/genetics/*radiation effects and DNA Repair/*genetics and Female and Gene Expression Regulation/*radiation effects and Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics and Reproduction/radiation effects and *Ultraviolet Rays and Water Pollutants, Radioactive/*toxicity",2015/11/18 06:00,S0166-445X(15)00140-X [pii] and 10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.05.002 [doi],26001085,8500246,"0 (Heat-Shock Proteins) and 0 (Water Pollutants, Radioactive)",Netherlands,Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Rats are opportunistic predators that are notorious for their impact on a variety of animal and plant species. However, little documented evidence on the complexities of these interactions is available.In our study, we assessed the impact of black rats Rattus rattus introduced on a small uninhabited island with a relatively simple ecosystem, Surprise Island, New Caledonia. We also compared the diet of R. rattus in the presence and absence of breeding seabirds, assessing the dietary compensation for this potentially important food source. From 2002 to 2005, we used live trapping studies combined with stable isotope analysis and conventional diet analyses (direct observations, gut and faecal contents) to characterize the diet of rats.Our results suggest a heavy predatory impact on seabirds, which could constitute as much as 24% of the rat diet. Moreover, in the absence of birds, rats compensated marginally by preying more heavily on other components of their diet but mostly acquired a new resource. They shifted their diet by preying heavily upon another endangered species, the hatchlings of sea turtles Chelonia mydas, which could constitute the main resource in the diet of R. rattus in those periods. Abundance, body condition and distribution of the rats were consistent with heavy predation upon this additional resource.Synthesis and applications. In island ecosystems invasive rats prey mainly upon seabird eggs and chicks, thereby threatening their populations. Although rats are certainly capable of surviving on terrestrial foods outside the seabird nesting season, their ability to prey upon ephemeral but abundant resources, such as hatchling sea turtles, may contribute to maintaining their populations. This may explain their success on Surprise Island, an ecosystem of extreme conditions, and suggests that biologists and managers working with threatened species should be aware of the possibility of temporary diet shifts by introduced rodents that may cause unexpected heavy predation on these species. This dietary shift from one endangered taxa to another has major implications for the conservation of seabirds and sea turtles world-wide and more generally for the biodiversity of invaded insular communities.",NA,2008/09/12 09:01,JPE1438 [pii] and 10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01438.x [doi],18784794,0055203,NA,England,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NLM,NA,PMC2326384,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we investigated the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on the feeding strategies of the urban yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) population inhabiting the highly dense city of Barcelona (NE Spain).

The results revealed that the anthropopause associated with the lockdown had an effect on the diet of this urban-dwelling predator. The diversity of prey consumed during the lockdown was lower, and consumption of urban birds (pigeons and parakeets) and marine prey (fishery discards and natural prey) decreased during the year of lockdown. Although it was not analysed, these diet changes probably were associated with variations in the availability of these resources due to the decrease in human activity during the lockdown.

Although this species is widely distributed throughout the world's tropical and subtropical oceanic waters, like many deep-water species, it remains very poorly understood due to its mesopelagic distribution. We used a suite of biochemical tracers, including stable isotope analysis (SIA), fatty acid analysis (FAA), and environmental DNA (eDNA), to investigate the trophic ecology of this species in the Central Pacific around Hawaii. We found that large epipelagic prey constituted a relatively minor part of the overall diet. Surprisingly, small micronektonic and forage species (meso- and epipelagic) are the most important prey group for Cookiecutter sharks across the studied size range (17-43 cm total length), with larger mesopelagic species or species that exhibit diel vertical migration also being important prey. These results were consistent across all the tracer techniques employed. Our results indicate that Cookiecutter sharks play a unique role in pelagic food webs, feeding on prey ranging from the largest apex predators to small, low trophic level species, in particular those that overlap with the depth distribution of the sharks throughout the diel cycle. We also found evidence of a potential shift in diet and/or habitat with size and season. Environmental DNA metabarcoding revealed new prey items for Cookiecutter sharks while also demonstrating that eDNA can be used to identify recent prey in stomachs frozen for extended periods. Integrating across chemical tracers is a powerful tool for investigating the ecology of elusive and difficult to study species, such as meso- and bathypelagic chondrichthyans, and can increase the amount of information gained from small sample sizes. Better resolving the foraging ecology of these mesopelagic predators is critical for effective conservation and management of these taxa and ecosystems, which are intrinsically vulnerable to overfishing and exploitation.","*Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena and Animals and Computational Biology/methods and DNA, Environmental and Ecology and *Ecosystem and Environment and Female and *Food Chain and High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing and Male and Population Dynamics and Radioactive Tracers and Seasons and *Sharks",2021/11/23 06:00,10.1038/s41598-021-89903-z [pii] and 89903 [pii] and 10.1038/s41598-021-89903-z [doi],34083578,101563288,"0 (DNA, Environmental) and 0 (Radioactive Tracers)",England,NA,10.1038/s41598-021-89903-z [doi] and 11809,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC8175345,The authors declare no competing interests.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To date, information regarding the life cycle and diet of Arctic lamprey is scarce, with no published studies examining [Hg] in Arctic lamprey tissues. Our goals were to investigate the feeding ecology of Arctic lamprey from the Bering Sea, determine how diet and potential dietary shifts might influence [Hg] in muscle, and determine if current [Hg] may pose a human health risk.

Semelparous squid species in particular can use up to 50% of the total energy intake for reproduction. However, the energy acquisition strategy for reproduction is still a controversial issue regarding whether the squid shift in diet ontogenetically. Here we used Argentinean shortfin squid (Illex argentinus) as a case study to investigate the strategy of energy acquisition for reproduction, by analyzing energy density of the squid's reproductive tissues including ovary, nidamental glands and oviduct eggs, and stable isotopes and fatty acids of the squid's ovary. RESULTS: The reproductive energy (the sum of the energy accumulated in ovary, nidamental glands and oviduct eggs) increased significantly with maturation. The ovary nitrogen stable isotopes (δ(15)N) showed a significant increase with maturation, but the increase by maturity stage was not equal to the typical enrichment of about 3‰ per trophic level. Isotopic niche width showed an increasing trend with maturation, and isotopic niche space exhibited greater overlap at advanced maturity stages. The relative amounts of 16:0, 20:5n3 and 20:4n6 in the ovary, tracing for carnivores and top predators, increased after the onset of maturation. The overall fatty acid profiles of the ovary showed significant differences among maturity stages, but obvious overlaps were found for mature squids. Mixed-effects model results revealed that reproductive energy was positively correlated with δ(15)N values. The reproductive energy was also positively related to the relative amounts of 18:0 and 20:4n6, respectively tracing for herbivores and top predators. CONCLUSIONS: Our results validate that the squid shifts to feed on higher trophic prey for reproduction as energy demand increases once maturation commences. However, the squid does not shift feeding habits at a trophic level but instead broadens prey spectrum, coupled with increasing intake of higher trophic prey items, to meet the energy demand for reproduction. Such energy acquisition strategy may be selected by the squid to maximize reproductive success by balancing energy intake and expenditure from foraging, warranting future studies that aim to clarify such strategy for reproduction among semelparous species.",NA,2022/11/18 06:01,10.1186/s12983-022-00473-w [pii] and 473 [pii] and 10.1186/s12983-022-00473-w [doi],36384560,101231669,NA,England,© 2022.

These were compared directly with measurements of different respective pools within the forest system, i.e. δ(13)C of organic matter input for δ(a)(13)CO(2), δ(18)O of exchangeable water for δ(a) C(18)O(16)O and transpired water vapour for δ(a) H(2)(18)O. [CO(2)] and δ(a)(13)CO(2) showed strong coupling, where the released CO(2) was, on average, 4 per mil enriched compared to the organic matter of plant material in the system, suggesting either fractionation of organic material before eventual release as soil-respired CO(2), or temporal differences in ecosystem discrimination. δ(a) C(18)O(16)O was less well coupled to [CO(2)], probably due to the heterogeneity and transient nature of water pools (soil, leaf and moss) within the forest. Similarly, δ(a) H(2)(18)O was less coupled to [H(2)O], again reflecting the transient nature of water transpired to the forest, seen as uncoupling during times of large changes in vapour pressure deficit. The δ(18)O of transpired water vapour, inferred from both mixing lines at the canopy scale and direct measurement at the leaf level, approximated that of source water, confirming that an isotopic steady state held for the forest integrated over the daily cycle. This demonstrates that isotopic coupling of CO(2) and water vapour within a forest canopy will depend on absolute differences in the isotopic composition of the respective pools involved in exchange and on the stability of each of these pools with time.",NA,1999/04/01 00:01,10.1007/s004420050766 [pii] and 10.1007/s004420050766 [doi],28308150,0150372,NA,Germany,NA,10.1007/s004420050766 [doi],CO2 and Carbon and Forest canopies and Key words Stable isotopes and Water vapour,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Exposure to manure from antibiotic-treated cattle caused: (i) changes in microbial community structure; and (ii) alterations in elemental cycling throughout the terrestrial system. This exposure caused changes in fungal : bacterial ratios, as well as changes in bacterial community structure. Additionally, exposure to manure from cattle treated with pirlimycin resulted in an approximate two-fold increase in ecosystem respiration of recently fixed-carbon, and a greater proportion of recently added nitrogen in plant and soil pools compared to the control manure.

Depending on the amount of input, dietary preference, and the strength of trophic links, allochthonous resources generally play a stabilizing role on food webs. In this study, we investigated the stabilizing role of allochthonous aquatic resources on intraguild predation (IGP) and their consequences on shared prey in a terrestrial ecosystem. To this end, we manipulated the input of emergent aquatic insects (the allochthonous resources) from streams to land, and predation pressure by bats and birds (the top predators), in a multitrophic food web using an orthogonal exclusion experiment. Using stable isotope metrics, we found that bats, birds, and spiders (the mesopredators), were highly subsidized by emergent aquatic insects. Moreover, among terrestrial prey, top predators fed more on spiders than insects. As predicted, spiders were strongly affected by the presence of top predators when allochthonous resources were excluded. Consequently, in this scenario terrestrial insects were two times more abundant. Because spiders showed a higher preference for consuming aquatic resources, we suggest that nonconsumptive effects of spiders upon terrestrial insects could be mediating the strong response of those shared prey. We demonstrate that the input of allochthonous aquatic resources can play a fundamental role in stabilizing terrestrial trophic interactions and trophic cascades in riparian zones via decreasing predation pressure.",Animals and Ecosystem and Food Chain and Insecta and *Predatory Behavior and *Spiders,2021/01/22 06:00,10.1002/ecy.3074 [doi],32304220,0043541,NA,United States,© 2020 by the Ecological Society of America.,10.1002/ecy.3074 [doi],diet and emergent aquatic insects and food web stability and intraguild interactions and nonconsumptive effects and tropic riparian forest,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,"001/Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior/International and NA/R2/180791/Newton Advanced Fellowship, The Royal Society/International and 2017/09052-4/Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo/International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Body size is often positively correlated with species traits such as metabolism, prey size and trophic position (TP) due to physiological and mechanical constraints. We used stable isotope analysis to quantify TP among minnows across multiple assemblages that differed in their species composition, diversity and food web structure. Body size significantly predicted TP across different lineages and assemblages, and indicated a significant negative relationship. The observed negative relationship between body size and TP is contrary to conventional knowledge, and is likely to have arisen owing to highly clade-specific patterns, such that clades consist of either large benthic species or small pelagic species. Cyprinids probably subvert the physiological and mechanical constraints that generally produce a positive relationship between body size and TP using anatomical modifications and by consuming small-bodied prey, respectively. The need for herbivorous cyprinids to digest cellulose-rich foods probably selected for larger bodies to accommodate longer intestinal tracts and thereby to facilitate digestion of nutrient-poor resources, such as algae.

One potential but under-studied N source for supporting increased plant growth under elevated CO(2) is soil organic N. In arid ecosystems, there have been no studies examining plant organic N uptake to date. To assess the potential effects of elevated atmospheric CO(2) on plant N uptake dynamics, we quantified plant uptake of organic and inorganic N forms in the dominant desert shrub Larrea tridentata under controlled environmental conditions. Seedlings of L. tridentata were grown in the Mojave Desert (NV, USA) soils that had been continuously exposed to ambient or elevated atmospheric CO(2) for 8 years at the Nevada Desert FACE Facility. After 6 months of growth in environmentally controlled chambers under ambient (380 micromol mol(-1)) or elevated (600 micromol mol(-1)) CO(2), pots were injected with stable isotopically labeled sole-N sources ((13)C-[2]-(15)N glycine, (15)NH(4) (+), or (15)NO(3) (-)) and moved back to their respective chambers for the remainder of the study. Plants were destructively harvested at 0, 2, 10, 24, and 49 days. Plant uptake of soil N derived from glycine, NH(4) (+), and NO(3) (-) increased under elevated CO(2) at days 2 and 10. Further, root uptake of organic N as glycine occurred as intact amino acid within the first hour after N treatment, indicated by approximately 1:1 M enrichment ratios of (13)C:(15)N. Plant N uptake responses to elevated CO(2) are often species-specific and could potentially shift competitive interactions between co-occurring species. Thus, physiological changes in root N uptake dynamics coupled with previously observed changes in the availability of soil N resources could impact plant community structure as well as ecosystem nutrient cycling under increasing atmospheric CO(2) levels in the Mojave Desert.",Carbon Dioxide/*analysis and Inorganic Chemicals/*metabolism and Larrea/*metabolism and Nitrogen/*metabolism and Organic Chemicals/*metabolism and Plants/*metabolism,2010/08/06 06:00,10.1007/s00442-010-1562-z [doi],20094733,0150372,0 (Inorganic Chemicals) and 0 (Organic Chemicals) and 142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide) and N762921K75 (Nitrogen),Germany,NA,10.1007/s00442-010-1562-z [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Thus, a 3-year field experiment was conducted to simulate HWs in conjunction with different mowing intensities that mimicking grazing in a Stipa krylovii steppe on the Mongolian Plateau. HWs significantly decreased ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO(2), ecosystem respiration (Re) and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) by 31%, 5% and 16%, respectively, over the three years.

Ust'-Polui is an Iron Age site located on the Lower Ob River, a major northern fishery characterized by extreme seasonal shifts in fish presence. During a 6-month period stretching over the coldest months of the year, fish are nearly entirely absent in the Lower Ob River. Despite this, the stable isotope compositions of the dog's bone and dentine collagen and hair and nail keratin all indicate a monotonous diet focusing on local fish. This pattern indicates the dog was provisioned year-round with fish. This was likely accomplished by mass harvesting of fish using nets or traps. Such fish were then processed and frozen for consumption during the non-fishing season.

A diet switching experiment utilizing a predatory ladybird beetle, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze), evaluated the use of naturally occurring stable C and N isotopes as an economically feasible and safe method for quantifying pathways of energy flow within agroecosystems. Stable isotope values of the ladybird beetle Coleomegilla maculata lengi (Timberlake) collected from an agroecosystem were used to estimate the relative amount of C and N derived from agricultural plants and incorporated by ladybird beetles based on mass balance equations. At the beginning of the diet-switching experiment δ(13)C and δ(15)N values of H. variegata (-12.0‰ and 6.3‰, respectively) differed by -0.2‰ and 2.9‰ from the aphids that were provided exclusively as their diet. These data are consistent with previous estimates of trophic level isotope effects. After switching the diet of H. variegata to an alternative food, isotope values of H. variegata gradually shifted toward expected values for individuals fed this diet (-22.9‰ and 8.8‰ for δ(13)C and δ(15)N values, respectively). Isotope values of another ladybird beetle, C. maculata, collected from the field indicated that in May, alfalfa and maize (pollen) obtained in the previous year contributed 32% and 68% of the C or N to the diets of these individuals and in August, 52%, 6%, and 42% of the C or N assimilated by these insects was derived from alfalfa, wheat, and maize, respectively. These data are consistent with expectations based on the relative abundance of C. maculata in various crops during the season. The field and laboratory data are a clear indication that isotope values are sensitive to dietary changes on a relatively short time scale (days) and provide a strong basis for the use stable C and N isotope to trace energy flow patterns of these beneficial organisms within agroecosystems.",NA,1996/12/01 00:01,10.1007/s004420050064 [pii] and 10.1007/s004420050064 [doi],28307600,0150372,NA,Germany,NA,10.1007/s004420050064 [doi],Agroecosystems and Energy flow and Food webs and Key words Stable isotopes and Lady beetles,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Paddy fields are a significant source of methane and account for 20% of global methane emissions, but the effect of electron acceptors on the methane emission process in flooded paddy fields has been poorly characterized. This study aimed to determine whether the electron acceptors ferric iron and nitrate, and biochar, acting as an electron shuttle, can regulate the AOM process in paddy soil, with or without interaction between biochar and these two electron acceptors. We also aimed to characterize which microorganisms are actively involved. Here, we added (13)C-labeled CH(4) ((13)CH(4)) into anaerobic microcosms to evaluate the role of electron acceptors by measuring the methane oxidation rate and the enrichment of (13)C-labeled CO(2) ((13)CO(2)). We then combined DNA-stable isotope probing with amplicon sequencing to study the active microorganisms. We found for the first time that, in addition to nitrate, ferric iron can also effectively promote AOM in paddy soil. However, there was no significant effect of biochar. Ferric iron-dependent AOM was mainly carried out by iron-reducing bacteria (Geobacter, Ammoniphilus and Clostridium), and nitrate-dependent AOM was mainly by nitrate-reducing bacteria (Rhodanobacter, Paenibacillus and Planococcus). Our results demonstrate that the AOM process, regulated by the electron acceptors ferric iron and nitrate, can alleviate methane emission from paddy soil.

To identify such energy flows and the main trophic pathways of energy transfer in the Minho River estuary, we investigated the spatial and temporal fluctuations of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios in benthic (and their potential food sources) and epibenthic consumers. Sampling was conducted along the estuarine salinity gradient from winter to summer of 2011. We found that the carbon (δ(13)C = (13)C/(12)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N = (15)N/(14)N) stable isotope ratios of the most abundant benthic and epibenthic consumers varied along the salinity gradient. The δ(13)C values increased seaward, whereas the opposite pattern was found for the δ(15)N, especially during the summer. The stable isotope ratios revealed two trophic pathways in the Minho estuary food web. The first pathway is supported by phytoplankton and represented by filter feeders such as zooplankton and some deposit feeders, particularly amphipods and polychaetes. The second pathway is supported by detritus and composed essentially of deposit feeders, which by being consumed, allow detritus to be incorporated into higher trophic levels. Spatial and temporal feeding variations in the estuarine benthic food web are driven by hydrology and proximity to adjacent ecosystems (terrestrial, marine). During high river discharge periods, the δ(13)C(POC) (ca. -28‰) and C: N(POM) (>10) values suggested an increase of terrestrial-derived OM to the particulate OM pool, which was then used by suspension feeders. During low river discharge periods, marine intrusion increased upriver, which was reflected in benthic consumers' (13)C-enriched stable isotope values. No relationship was found between food quality (phytoplankton vs. detritus) and food chain length because the lowest and highest values were associated with freshwater and saltmarsh areas, respectively, both dominated by the detrital pathway. This study demonstrates that benthic consumers enhance the connectivity between estuaries and its adjacent ecosystems by utilizing subsidies of terrestrial and marine origin and that benthic-pelagic coupling is an important energy transfer mechanism to the benthic food web.",NA,2023/09/21 06:43,10.1016/j.fooweb.2023.e00282 [doi],37731992,9918680284406676,NA,Netherlands,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2023.e00282 [doi],Connectivity and Detritus and Food chain and River discharge and Stable isotopes,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,EPA999999/ImEPA/Intramural EPA/United States,PMC10508047,Declaration of Competing Interest None,NA,NA,NA,NIHMS1928846,NA,NA,2024/06/01

The mummy (initially assumed to be a German bog body) was localized by stable isotope analysis to South America at/near the Peruvian/Northern Chilean coast line. This is further supported by New World camelid fibers attached to her plaits, typical Inca-type skull deformation and the type of Wormian bone at her occiput. Despite an only small transverse wound of the supraorbital region computed tomography scans show an almost complete destruction of face and frontal skull bones with terrace-like margins, but without evidence for tissue reaction. The type of destruction indicates massive blunt force applied to the center of the face. Stable isotope analysis indicates South American origin: Nitrogen and hydrogen isotope patterns indicate an extraordinarily high marine diet along with C4-plant alimentation which fits best to the coastal area of Pacific South America. A hair strand over the last ten months of her life indicates a shift to a more ""terrestric"" nutrition pattern suggesting either a move from the coast or a change in her nutrition. Paleoradiology further shows extensive hypertrophy of the heart muscle and a distended large bowel/rectum. Histologically, in the rectum wall massive fibrosis alternates with residual smooth muscle.

Further, Collembola presence resulted in an increase in plant defence-related GO terms suggesting that Collembola in the rhizosphere prime oak shoots against the attack by fungi or herbivores. Notably, the impact of Collembola on growth, resource allocation and oak gene expression was modified by presence of P. croceum.

Although these methods accurately identify diet in raptors, they are time-consuming, resource-intensive, and associated with biases from the feeding ecology of raptors like Gyps vultures. Our study set out to estimate diet composition in Gyps vultures informed by stable isotopes that provide a good representation of assimilated diet from local systems.We hypothesized that differences in Gyps vulture diet composition is a function of sampling location and that these vultures move between Serengeti National Park and Selous Game Reserve to forage. We also theorized that grazing ungulates are the principal items in Gyps vulture diet.Through combined linear and Bayesian modeling, diet derived from δ(13)C in Gyps vultures consisted of grazing herbivores across sites, with those in Serengeti National Park consuming higher proportions of grazing herbivores (>87%). δ(13)C differences in vulture feather subsets did not indicate shifts in vulture diet and combined with blood δ(13)C, vultures fed largely on grazers for ~159 days before they were sampled. Similarly, δ(15)N values indicated Gyps vultures fed largely on herbivores. δ(34)S ratios separated where vultures fed when the two sites were compared. δ(34)S variation in vultures across sites resulted from baseline differences in plant δ(34)S values, though it is not possible to match δ(34)S to specific locations.Our findings highlight the relevance of repeated sampling that considers tissues with varying isotopic turnover and emerging Bayesian techniques for dietary studies using stable isotopes.

The very low δ(15)N values (-7.7 ‰) suggest that (1) Picea mainly uses inorganic nitrogen (probably mainly ammonium) or organic N in fresh litter, (2) Vaccinium (-4.3 ‰) with its ericoid mycorrhizae uses more stable organic matter, and (3) Calamagrostis (+0.9 ‰) exploits deeper soil horizons with higher δ(15)N values of soil N. We conclude that species limited by the same nutrient may coexist by drawing on different pools of soil N in a nutrient-deficient environment. The differences among life-forms decrease with increasing N availability. The different levels of δ(15)N are associated with different nitrogen concentrations in leaves, Picea having a lower N concentration (0.62 mmol g(-1)) than Vaccinium (0.98 mmol g(-1)) or Calamagrostis (1.33 mmol g(-1)). An extended vector analysis by Timmer and Armstrong (1987) suggests that N is the most limiting element for Picea in this habitat, causing needle yellowing at N concentrations below 0.5 mmol g(-1) or N contents below 2 mmol needle(-1). Increasing N supply had an exponential effect on twig and needle growth. Phosphorus, potassium and magnesium are at marginal supply, but no interaction between ammonium supply and needle Mg concentration could be detected.

To examine the effects of exposure to radiation on gene expression in wildlife, we conducted a de novo RNA sequencing study of liver and spleen tissues from a rodent, the bank vole Myodes glareolus. Bank voles were collected from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ), where animals were exposed to elevated levels of radionuclides, and from uncontaminated areas near Kyiv, Ukraine. Counter to expectations, we did not observe a strong DNA damage response in animals exposed to radionuclides, although some signs of oxidative stress were identified. Rather, exposure to environmental radionuclides was associated with upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and fatty acid oxidation in the livers - an apparent shift in energy metabolism. Moreover, using stable isotope analysis, we identified that fur from bank voles inhabiting the CEZ had enriched isotope values of nitrogen: such an increase is consistent with increased fatty acid metabolism, but also could arise from a difference in diet or habitat between the CEZ and elsewhere. In livers and spleens, voles inhabiting the CEZ were characterized by immunosuppression, such as impaired antigen processing, and activation of leucocytes involved in inflammatory responses. In conclusion, exposure to low dose environmental radiation impacts pathways associated with immunity and lipid metabolism, potentially as a stress-induced coping mechanism.","Animals and Arvicolinae and *Chernobyl Nuclear Accident and DNA Damage/radiation effects and DNA Repair/radiation effects and Fatty Acids/metabolism and Immune System/radiation effects and Lipid Metabolism/genetics/*physiology and Liver/immunology/*pathology and Mutagens/adverse effects and Oxidation-Reduction/radiation effects and Oxidative Stress/radiation effects and Radiation Exposure/*adverse effects and Radiation, Ionizing and Radioisotopes/adverse effects and Spleen/immunology/*pathology and Ukraine",2020/06/17 06:00,MEC15241 [pii] and 10.1111/mec.15241 [doi],31498518,9214478,0 (Fatty Acids) and 0 (Mutagens) and 0 (Radioisotopes),England,© 2019 The Authors.

Some widespread invasive species such as crayfish are potential competitors and reciprocal predators of ecologically and recreationally important native fish species. Here, we examine the effects of signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) on the growth, diet, and trophic position of the chub (Squalius cephalus) in four rivers in Britain. Growth rates of 0+ chub were typically lower in sympatric populations with signal crayfish compared with allopatric populations, and this effect could be traced through to 2+ chub in one river. However, growth rates of older chub (5+ to 6+) were typically higher in the presence of crayfish. Sympatry with crayfish resulted in lower chub length-at-age and mass-at-age in half of the rivers sampled, with no change detected in the other rivers. Stable isotope analyses (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) revealed that both chub and crayfish were omnivorous, feeding at multiple trophic levels and occupying similar trophic positions. We found some evidence that chub trophic position was greater at invaded sites on one river, with no difference detected on a second river. Mixing models suggested crayfish were important food items for both small and large chub at invaded sites.

This colonization constitutes the mycorrhizal nutrient uptake pathway (MP) and supplements the pathway through roots. Simultaneously, the extraradical hyphae of each AM fungus is associated with a community of bacteria. However, whether the community structure and function of the microbiome on the extraradical hyphae differ between AM fungal species remains unknown. In order to understand the community structure and the predicted functions of the microbiome associated with different AM fungal species, a split-root compartmented rhizobox cultivation system, which allowed us to inoculate two AM fungal species separately in two root compartments, was used. We inoculated two separate AM fungal species combinations, (i) Funneliformis mosseae and Gigaspora margarita and (ii) Rhizophagus intraradices and G. margarita, on a single root system of cotton. The hyphal exudate-fed, active microbiome was measured by combining (13)C-DNA stable isotope probing with MiSeq sequencing. We found that different AM fungal species, which were simultaneously colonizing a single root system, hosted active microbiomes that were distinct from one another. Moreover, the predicted potential functions of the different microbiomes were distinct. We conclude that the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal component of the system is responsible for the recruitment of distinct microbiomes in the hyphosphere. The potential significance of the predicted functions of the microbial ecosystem services is discussed.IMPORTANCE Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form tight symbiotic relationships with the majority of terrestrial plants and play critical roles in plant P acquisition, adding a further dimension of complexity. The plant-AM fungus-bacterium system is considered a continuum, with the bacteria colonizing not only the plant roots, but also the associated mycorrhizal hyphal network, known as the hyphosphere microbiome. Plant roots are usually colonized by different AM fungal species which form an independent phosphorus uptake pathway from the root pathway, i.e., the mycorrhizal pathway. The community structure and function of the hyphosphere microbiome of different AM species are completely unknown. In this novel study, we found that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi cocolonizing on single plant roots recruit their own specific microbiomes, which should be considered in evaluating plant microbiome form and function. Our findings demonstrate the importance of understanding trophic interactions in order to gain insight into the plant-AM fungus-bacterium symbiosis.",NA,2020/12/17 06:01,5/6/e00929-20 [pii] and mSystems00929-20 [pii] and 10.1128/mSystems.00929-20 [doi],33323417,101680636,NA,United States,Copyright © 2020 Zhou et al.,10.1128/mSystems.00929-20 [doi] and e00929-20,13C-DNA-SIP and COG and arbuscular mycorrhizae and hyphal exudates and hyphosphere and microbiome and mycorrhizal pathway,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,PMC7771537,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To investigate the diet of the barnacle Amphibalanus eburneus, a dominant suspension feeder within the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) of central Florida, we compared the stable isotopes ratios (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) of barnacle tissue to those of particulate organic matter (POM). Collections were carried out quarterly for a year from 29 permanent sites and at sites impacted by an Aureoumbra lagunensis bloom. δ(13)C and δ(15)N values of Amphibalanus eburneus varied across sites, but δ(15)N was more stable over time. There was a range of δ(15)N values of Amphibalanus eburneus tissue from 6.0‰ to 10.5‰ across sites. Because land-based sources such as sewage are generally enriched in (15)N, this suggests a continuum of anthropogenic influence across sites in the IRL. Over 70% of the variation in δ(15)N values of Amphibalanus eburneus across sites was driven by the δ(15)N values of POM, supporting a generalist feeding strategy on available sources of suspended organic matter. The dominance of this generalist consumer in the IRL may be linked to its ability to consume spatially and temporally variable food resources derived from natural and anthropogenic sources, as well as Aureoumbra lagunensis cells. Generalist consumers such as Amphibalanus eburneus serve an important ecological role in this ecosystem and act as a sentinel species and recorder of local, site-specific isotopic baselines.",NA,2018/08/22 06:01,5485 [pii] and 10.7717/peerj.5485 [doi],30128215,101603425,NA,United States,NA,10.7717/peerj.5485 [doi] and e5485,Algal bloom and Barnacles and Estuary and Generalist and Indian River Lagoon and Stable isotopes and Suspension feeders,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,PMC6098678,The authors declare that they have no competing interests.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methane (CH(4)) production and oxidation also contribute CO(2) to freshwaters, yet this remains largely unquantified. Flood pulse lakes and rivers in the tropics are hypothesized to receive large inputs of dissolved CO(2) and CH(4) from floodplains characterized by hypoxia and reducing conditions. We measured stable C isotopes of CO(2) and CH(4), aerobic respiration, and CH(4) production and oxidation during two flood stages in Tonle Sap Lake (Cambodia) to determine whether dissolved CO(2) in this tropical flood pulse ecosystem has a methanogenic origin. Mean CO(2) supersaturation of 11,000 ± 9,000 μatm could not be explained by aerobic respiration alone. (13)C depletion of dissolved CO(2) relative to other sources of organic and inorganic C, together with corresponding (13)C enrichment of CH(4), suggested extensive CH(4) oxidation. A stable isotope-mixing model shows that the oxidation of (13)C depleted CH(4) to CO(2) contributes between 47 and 67% of dissolved CO(2) in Tonle Sap Lake. (13)C depletion of dissolved CO(2) was correlated to independently measured rates of CH(4) production and oxidation within the water column and underlying lake sediments. However, mass balance indicates that most of this CH(4) production and oxidation occurs elsewhere, within inundated soils and other floodplain habitats. Seasonal inundation of floodplains is a common feature of tropical freshwaters, where high reported CO(2) supersaturation and atmospheric emissions may be explained in part by coupled CH(4) production and oxidation.",NA,2022/02/16 06:01,2107667119 [pii] and 202107667 [pii] and 10.1073/pnas.2107667119 [doi],35165188,7505876,NA,United States,Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

This introduction of hard substrate has been shown to have similar effects as artificial reefs by providing food resources and offering increased habitat complexity, thereby aggregating fish around the turbines and foundations. However, as most studies have focused their efforts on fish species that are typically associated with reef structures, knowledge on how soft sediment species are affected by OWFs is still largely lacking. In this study, we analysed the trophic ecology and condition of plaice, a flatfish species of commercial interest, in relation to a Belgian OWF. The combination of a stomach and intestine content analysis with the use of biomarkers (i.e. fatty acids and stable isotopes) identified a clear shift in diet with increased occurrences of typical hard-substrate prey species for fish in the vicinity of the foundations and this both on the short and the long term. Despite some condition indices suggesting that the hard substrate provides increased food availability, no clear increases of overall plaice condition or fecundity were found. Samples from within the wind farm, however, contained larger fish and had a higher abundance of females compared to control areas, potentially indicating a refuge effect caused by the cessation of fisheries activities within the OWF. These results suggest that soft-sediment species can potentially benefit from the presence of an OWF, which could lead to fish production. However, more research is still needed to further elucidate the behavioral ecology of plaice within OWFs to make inferences on how they can impact fish populations on a larger spatial scale.",Animals and *Flounder and Energy-Generating Resources and Wind and Ecosystem and Nutritional Status and Fishes,2023/01/20 06:00,S0048-9697(22)07833-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160730 [doi],36496027,0330500,NA,Netherlands,Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Microbial predation is crucial to fundamental understanding of how biological interactions drive microbiome structuring and functioning of WWTPs. However, predatory bacteria have received little attention regarding their diversity, activity, and ecological function in activated sludge, limiting the exploitation of food web interactions for wastewater microbiome engineering. Here, by using rRNA-stable isotope probing of activated sludge microbiota with (13)C-labeled prey bacteria, we uncovered diverse as-yet-uncultivated putative predatory bacteria that actively incorporated (13)C-biomass. Myxobacteria, especially Haliangium and the mle1-27 clade, were found as the dominant active predators, refreshing conventional views based on a few predatory isolates of Bdellovibrionota from WWTPs. The identified predatory bacteria showed more selective predation on prey compared with the protists dominated by ciliates, providing in situ evidence for inter-domain predation behavior divergence in activated sludge. Putative predatory bacteria were tracked over a two-year microbiome monitoring effort at a local WWTP, revealing the predominance of Myxococcota (6.5 ± 1.3%) over Bdellovibrionota (1.0 ± 0.2%) lineages. Phylogenetic analysis unveiled highly diverse myxobacteria inhabiting activated sludge and suggested a habitat filtering effect in global WWTPs. Further mining of a global activated sludge microbiome dataset revealed the prevalence of Myxococcota (5.4 ± 0.1%) species and potential impacts of myxobacterial predation on process performance. Collectively, our findings provided unique insights into the predating activity, diversity, and prevalence of Myxococcota species in activated sludge, highlighting their links with wastewater treatment processes via trophic regulation of enteric and functional bacteria.",Animals and Sewage/microbiology and *Myxococcales/genetics and Phylogeny and Predatory Behavior and Prevalence and Bacteria and *Water Purification,2023/04/24 06:41,10.1038/s41396-023-01378-0 [pii] and 1378 [pii] and 10.1038/s41396-023-01378-0 [doi],36774445,101301086,0 (Sewage),England,© 2023.

The micro-organisms in pumped water from the actively mined areas, as well as, pre- and post-mining formation waters were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The methane stable isotope composition of Bowen Basin coal seam indicates that methanogenesis has occurred in the geological past. More recently at the mine site, changing groundwater flow dynamics and the introduction of oxygen in the subsurface has increased microbial biomass and diversity. Consistent with microbial communities found in other coal seam environments, pumped coal mine waters from the subsurface were dominated by bacteria belonging to the genera Pseudomonas and the family Rhodocyclaceae. These environments and bacterial communities supported a methanogen population, including Methanobacteriaceae, Methanococcaceae and Methanosaeta. However, one of the most ubiquitous micro-organisms in anoxic coal mine waters belonged to the family 'Candidatus Methanoperedenaceae'. As the Archaeal family 'Candidatus Methanoperedenaceae' has not been extensively defined, the one studied species in the family is capable of anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction. This introduces the possibility that a methane cycle between archaeal methanogenesis and methanotrophy may exist in the anoxic waters of the coal seam after hydrogeological disturbance.","Archaea/*classification/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism and Bacteria/*classification/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism and *Biota and Cluster Analysis and Coal and DNA, Archaeal/chemistry/genetics and DNA, Bacterial/chemistry/genetics and DNA, Ribosomal/chemistry/genetics and Methane/*metabolism and Mining and Phylogeny and Queensland and RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics and Sequence Analysis, DNA and *Soil Microbiology",2016/12/15 06:00,10.1111/gbi.12166 [doi],26541089,101185472,"0 (Coal) and 0 (DNA, Archaeal) and 0 (DNA, Bacterial) and 0 (DNA, Ribosomal) and 0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S) and OP0UW79H66 (Methane)",England,© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,10.1111/gbi.12166 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,GENBANK/SRS778814 and GENBANK/SRS778815 and GENBANK/SRS778817 and GENBANK/SRS778818 and GENBANK/SRS778819 and GENBANK/SRS778820 and GENBANK/SRS778821,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To characterize and manage the associated risks, considerable numbers of organisms are sampled regularly for monitoring purposes. However, ethical and financial issues call for an alternative, more generic and more robust approach for assessing the internal exposure of fish that circumvents large variability in biota sampling due to interindividual differences. Passive sampling devices (PSDs) offer a fugacity-based approach for pollutant enrichment from different abiotic environmental compartments with a subsequent estimation of bioaccumulation in fish which we explored and compared to HOC concentrations in fish as determined using traditional approaches. RESULTS: In this study, concentrations in silicone-based PSDs applied to the water phase and suspended particulate matter (SPM) of a river polluted with HOCs were used to estimate the concentration in model lipids at thermodynamic equilibrium with either environmental compartment. For comparison, muscle tissue of seven fish species (trophic level 1.8 to 2.8) was extracted using traditional exhaustive solvent extraction, and the lipid-normalized concentrations of HOCs were determined. The PSD-based data from SPM proved to be a more conservative estimator for HOCs accumulated in fish than those from water. Body length of the fish was found to be more suitable to describe increasing accumulation of HOCs than their trophic level as derived from stable isotope analysis and might offer a suitable alternative for future studies. CONCLUSIONS: By combining fugacity-based sampling in the abiotic environment, translation into corresponding concentrations in model lipids and body length as an indicator for increasing bioaccumulation in fish, we present a suggestion for a robust approach that may be a meaningful addition to conventional monitoring methods. This approach potentially increases the efficiency of existing monitoring programs without the need to regularly sacrifice vertebrate species.

Restoration efforts are enhanced by reintroducing naturally occurring ecosystem processes, including disturbances that may impact species characteristics such as niche position or niche size. In grasslands, grazing and fire affect plant diversity and habitat complexity, which potentially influence insect dietary behaviors and thus their contributions to functions like seed and arthropod predation. Using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, we characterized variation in the dietary niche of six ground beetle species (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in response to grazing by reintroduced bison and prescribed fire disturbances in twenty tallgrass prairies. Management disturbances did not affect activity density for most beetle species and mean trophic position was mostly unaffected. However, five of six species exhibited increased trophic niche area and breadth with disturbances, indicating a switch to a more generalist diet that incorporated a wider range of food items. The combination of bison and fire impacts may increase vegetation patchiness and heterogeneity, driving these diet changes. Morphological traits and microhabitat preferences might mediate response to disturbances and the resulting heterogeneity.

METHODS: Nineteen children (n = 10 boys, n = 9 girls) at Tanner stage I or II participated (mean age ± 95% CI = 9.84 ± 0.77 y) in this study. Food was administered to the children for three days preceding their scheduled breath tests. Breath tests and indirect calorimetry were performed after an 8-h fast before and 60 min following consumption of a 30-g simple RDC drink consisting of maltodextrin and sucrose. Open circuit spirometry and indirect calorimetry monitored resting metabolism and CHO oxidation. Separate breath samples were taken every 15 min. Samples of all foods and breath samples were analyzed for (13)C and (12)C abundances with a stable-isotope mass spectrometer. RESULTS: (13)C in expired breath samples were -23.81 ± 1.64‰ at baseline and increased every 15 min after consumption of the CHO drink (p < 0.001-0.009). Cumulative total, endogenous, and exogenous CHO utilization increased during the post-prandial period (p < 0.001). Endogenous CHO oxidation was consistently greater than exogenous CHO oxidation (p < 0.001-0.002).Blood glucose was elevated from baseline at 30- and 60-min post-prandial (p < 0.001). Insulin did not change over time (p = 0.184). CONCLUSIONS: The foods provided during the 3-day controlled diet effectively minimized (13)C variation prior to metabolic testing. The (13)C abundances of foods reported herein should serve as practical recommendations to reduce (13)C intake before breath tests. While endogenous CHO oxidation remained greater in proportion to exogenous CHO oxidation, these findings suggest that even a relatively small amount of RDC can increase exogenous CHO oxidation and blood glucose in normal-weight children. To further examine shifts in endogenous versus exogenous CHO utilization, we recommend that future studies take steps to minimize (13)C variation before breath tests and examine changes in substrate metabolism at rest and during exercise in normal weight and overweight pre-pubescent children.

Such ""magic traits"" are known to be involved in most of the compelling examples of sympatric speciation. In this study, we report a possible case of sympatric speciation without magic traits. Three species of ricefish (genus Oryzias) are suggested to have diverged sympatrically within Lake Poso, an ancient lake in Sulawesi. An analysis of genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms showed that these three species are reproductively isolated from each other throughout the lake. Stable isotope analyses revealed that the three species use different food resources, which reflect differences in their feeding morphologies (gill rakers and digestive tracts) and feeding sites. Field and laboratory observations showed that O. nebulosus and O. orthognathus share a mating habitat of cobbles, where they scatter fertilized eggs, whereas this site is never used by O. nigrimas, indicating that assortative mating is partly achieved by spatial isolation. The small, less-adhesive eggs of O. nebulosus and O. orthognathus probably reflect their adaptation to spawning on cobble beaches. Laboratory mating experiments showed strong prezygotic isolation between O. nebulosus and O. orthognathus, which is achieved by strong species recognition presumably by both sexes based on species-specific mating dances and nuptial coloration. In summary, the assortative mating of O. nebulosus and O. orthognathus is probably not coupled to resource partitioning.

However, disturbance should also affect spatial networks by altering habitat heterogeneity and resource availability. Variation in resource availability should perturb the frequency and nature of social and ecological interactions within a population by affecting the spatial distribution of individuals. In disturbed habitats where resources are limiting, spatial relationships should reflect behavioural differences among individuals, with higher-quality resources controlled by dominant individuals. In contrast, all individuals may exploit preferred resources in resource-rich habitats. Environmental variation and population reorganization may also result in variation in morphological, behavioural and ecological traits, which ultimately affect fitness. We addressed these considerations for male tree lizards (Urosaurus ornatus) at three sites that differ in levels of disturbance. The habitats at these localities differed in the availability of live trees, the preferred microhabitat of U. ornatus. In addition, male U. ornatus exhibits a polymorphism in dewlap colour linked with differences in aggression, which should influence their position in a network and access to resources. We applied a network framework to characterize the spatial organization of male morphs at each site and quantified male aggressive behaviour in the laboratory. We also compared body size, body condition, number of bite marks, parasite load and the microhabitat use and diet, of males among the sites. We detected no significant differences in spatial network structure between unburned and infrequently burned sites. However, at a frequently burned site, the network shifted towards geographically closer, heteromorphic male neighbour associations. Males at this site were also larger, more aggressive and had more bite marks but fewer parasites than males at the other sites. Moreover, we detected divergence in microhabitat use and diet among the morphs at the frequently burned site that reflected the shift in spatial network structure and differences in morph behaviour. That is, only more aggressive morphs usurped trees and consumed prey from higher trophic levels. We conclude that environmental variation may influence animal spatial network structure. Jointly, behavioural and environmental variation may promote despotic social dynamics and ecological divergence in resource-limited habitats.","*Aggression and Animals and Arizona and *Ecosystem and Fires and Lizards/genetics/*physiology and Male and *Pigmentation and Polymorphism, Genetic and Population Dynamics and *Social Behavior",2016/04/07 06:00,10.1111/1365-2656.12252 [doi],24889087,0376574,NA,England,© 2014 The Authors.

We integrated data on Weddell seal diving behaviour, diet stable isotopes, feeding success and mass gain to examine shifts in vertical foraging throughout ice break-out and the resulting phytoplankton bloom each year. We also tested hypotheses about the likely location of phytoplankton bloom origination (advected or produced in situ where seals foraged) based on sea ice break-out phenology and advection rates from several locations within 150 km of the seal colony. In early summer, seals foraged at deeper depths resulting in lower feeding rates and mass gain. As sea ice extent decreased throughout the summer, seals foraged at shallower depths and benefited from more efficient energy intake. Changes in diving depth were not due to seasonal shifts in seal diets or horizontal space use and instead may reflect a change in the vertical distribution of prey. Correspondence between the timing of seal shallowing and the resource pulse was variable from year to year and could not be readily explained by our existing understanding of the ocean and ice dynamics. Phytoplankton advection occurred faster than ice break-out, and seal dive shallowing occurred substantially earlier than local break-out. While there remains much to be learned about the marine ecosystem, it appears that an increase in prey abundance and accessibility via shallower distributions during the resource pulse could synchronize life-history phenology across trophic levels in this high-latitude ecosystem.","Animals and *Ecosystem and Feeding Behavior and Oceans and Seas and Predatory Behavior and *Seals, Earless and Seasons",2021/05/21 06:00,rspb20202817 [pii] and 10.1098/rspb.2020.2817 [doi],33726591,101245157,NA,England,NA,10.1098/rspb.2020.2817 [doi] and 20202817,climate change and consumption and phenology and predation and seasonality and trade-off,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,P20 GM103395/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States,PMC8059541,NA,NA,figshare/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5335204,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, in soil, the diversity of animals seems enigmatic since the soil is a rather homogeneous habitat, and soil animals are often generalist feeders. A new approach to understand soil animal diversity is the use of ecological stoichiometry. The elemental composition of animals may explain their occurrence, distribution, and density. This approach has been used before in soil macrofauna, but this study is the first to investigate soil mesofauna. Using inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), we analyzed the concentration of a wide range of elements (Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, S, Zn) in 15 soil mite taxa (Oribatida, Mesostigmata) from the litter of two different forest types (beech, spruce) in Central Europe (Germany). Additionally, the concentration of carbon and nitrogen, and their stable isotope ratios ((15)N/(14)N, (13)C/(12)C), reflecting their trophic niche, were measured. We hypothesized that (1) stoichiometry differs between mite taxa, (2) stoichiometry of mite taxa occurring in both forest types is not different, and (3) element composition is correlated to trophic level as indicated by (15)N/(14)N ratios. The results showed that stoichiometric niches of soil mite taxa differed considerably indicating that elemental composition is an important niche dimension of soil animal taxa. Further, stoichiometric niches of the studied taxa did not differ significantly between the two forest types. Calcium was negatively correlated with trophic level indicating that taxa incorporating calcium carbonate in their cuticle for defense occupy lower trophic positions in the food web. Furthermore, a positive correlation of phosphorus with trophic level indicated that taxa higher in the food web have higher energetic demand.

However, current knowledge of the biodiversity and genetic potential of the involved microbial participants, especially syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria (SAOB), is limited due to the low abundance of these microorganisms and challenges in their isolation. The intent of this study was to enrich and identify potential SAOB. Therefore, we conducted continuous acetate feeding under high ammonia concentrations using two separate inoculum consortia of microorganisms that originated from full-scale mesophilic food waste digesters, which lasted for more than 200 days. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic analyses, we observed a convergence of the experimental microbial communities during the enrichment regarding taxonomic composition and metabolic functional composition. Stable carbon isotope analyses of biogas indicated that SAO-HM was the dominant methanogenic pathway during the enrichment process. The hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanoculleus dominated the archaeal community. The enriched SAO community featured high biodiversity and metabolic functional redundancy. By analyzing the metagenome-assembled genomes, the known SAOB Syntrophaceticus schinkii and six uncultured populations were identified to have the genetic potential to perform SAO through the conventional reversed Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, while another six bacteria were found to encode the reversed Wood-Ljungdahl pathway combined with a glycine cleavage system as novel SAOB candidates. These results showed that the food waste anaerobic digesters harbor diverse SAOB and highlighted the importance of the glycine cleavage system for acetate oxidation. IMPORTANCE Syntrophic acetate oxidation to CO(2) and H(2), together with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, contributes to much of the carbon flux in the anaerobic digestion of organic wastes, especially at high ammonia concentrations. A deep understanding of the biodiversity, metabolic genetic potential, and ecology of the SAO community can help to improve biomethane production from wastes for clean energy production. Here, we enriched the SAO-HM functional guild obtained from full-scale food waste anaerobic digesters and recorded dynamic changes in community taxonomic composition and functional profiles. By reconstructing the metabolic pathways, diverse known and novel bacterial members were found to have SAO potential via the reversed Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway alone, or via the reversed WL pathway with a glycine cleavage system (WLP-GCS), and those catalyzing WLP-GCS showed higher microbial abundance. This study revealed the biodiversity and metabolic functional redundancy of SAOB in full-scale anaerobic digester systems and provided inspiration for further genome-centric studies.","Humans and Microbial Consortia/genetics and Ammonia/metabolism and Anaerobiosis and Food and RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics and *Refuse Disposal and Bacteria/genetics and Oxidation-Reduction and *Euryarchaeota/genetics and Acetates/metabolism",2022/09/09 06:01,00339-22 [pii] and msystems.00339-22 [pii] and 10.1128/msystems.00339-22 [doi],36073802,101680636,"7664-41-7 (Ammonia) and 0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S) and 0 (Acetates)",United States,NA,10.1128/msystems.00339-22 [doi] and e00339-22,anaerobic digestion and biodiversity and functional redundancy and metagenomic analysis and methanogenic pathway and syntrophic acetate oxidation,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,PMC9600251,The authors declare no conflict of interest.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hydrothermally extinct, or inactive, sulfide deposits also host microbial communities at globally distributed sites. The main goal of this study is to describe Fe transformation pathways, through precipitation and oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions, and examine transformation products for signatures of biological activity using Fe mineralogy and stable isotope approaches. The study includes active and inactive sulfides from the East Pacific Rise 9°50'N vent field. First, the mineralogy of Fe(III)-bearing precipitates is investigated using microprobe X-ray absorption spectroscopy (μXAS) and X-ray diffraction (μXRD). Second, laser-ablation (LA) and micro-drilling (MD) are used to obtain spatially-resolved Fe stable isotope analysis by multicollector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). Eight Fe-bearing minerals representing three mineralogical classes are present in the samples: oxyhydroxides, secondary phyllosilicates, and sulfides. For Fe oxyhydroxides within chimney walls and layers of Si-rich material, enrichments in both heavy and light Fe isotopes relative to pyrite are observed, yielding a range of δ(57)Fe values up to 6‰. Overall, several pathways for Fe transformation are observed. Pathway 1 is characterized by precipitation of primary sulfide minerals from Fe(II)aq-rich fluids in zones of mixing between vent fluids and seawater. Pathway 2 is also consistent with zones of mixing but involves precipitation of sulfide minerals from Fe(II)aq generated by Fe(III) reduction. Pathway 3 is direct oxidation of Fe(II) aq from hydrothermal fluids to form Fe(III) precipitates. Finally, Pathway 4 involves oxidative alteration of pre-existing sulfide minerals to form Fe(III). The Fe mineralogy and isotope data do not support or refute a unique biological role in sulfide alteration. The findings reveal a dynamic range of Fe transformation pathways consistent with a continuum of micro-environments having variable redox conditions. These micro-environments likely support redox cycling of Fe and S and are consistent with culture-dependent and -independent assessments of microbial physiology and genetic diversity of hydrothermal sulfide deposits.",NA,2016/06/01 06:01,10.3389/fmicb.2016.00648 [doi],27242685,101548977,NA,Switzerland,NA,10.3389/fmicb.2016.00648 [doi] and 648,East Pacific Rise and X-ray absorption spectroscopy and biosignature and hydrothermal and iron and micro-environment and mineral alteration and stable isotopes,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,PMC4862312,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Such simplistic models can sometimes limit our understanding of ecological principles. We used a polyphagous species with a wide distribution, the brown bear (Ursus arctos), to illustrate how disparate theoretical frameworks in ecology can affect conclusions regarding ecological communities. We used stable isotope measurements (δ(13) C, δ(15) N) from hairs of individually monitored bears in Sweden and Bayesian mixing models to estimate dietary proportions of ants, moose, and three berry species to compare with other brown bear populations. We also developed three hypotheses based on predominant foraging literature, and then compared predicted diets to field estimates. Our three models assumed (1) bears forage to optimize caloric efficiency (optimum foraging model), predicting bears predominately eat berries (~70% of diet) and opportunistically feed on moose (Alces alces) and ants (Formica spp. and Camponotus spp; ~15% each); (2) bears maximize meat intake (maximizing fitness model), predicting a diet of 35%-50% moose, followed by ants (~30%), and berries (~15%); (3) bears forage to optimize macronutrient balance (macronutrient model), predicting a diet of ~22% (dry weight) or 17% metabolizable energy from proteins, with the rest made up of carbohydrates and lipids (~49% and 29% dry matter or 53% and 30% metabolizable energy, respectively). Bears primarily consumed bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus; 50%-55%), followed by lingonberries (V. vitis-idaea; 22%-30%), crowberries (Empetrum nigrum; 8%-15%), ants (5%-8%), and moose (3%-4%). Dry matter dietary protein was lower than predicted by the maximizing fitness model and the macronutrient balancing model, but protein made up a larger proportion of the metabolizable energy than predicted. While diets most closely resembled predictions from optimal foraging theory, none of the foraging hypotheses fully described the relationship between foraging and ecological niches in brown bears.

Both methods observed ontogenetic shifts in dietary preference and individual specializations, and revealed that the total niche width of large individuals was greater than small individuals. Mixed linear models indicated that feeding activity was significantly influenced by time (p < 0.0001), and no significant changes among size groups was evident (p = 0.244). Niche overlaps revealed that there was intensive diet competition between different size groups of black amur bream. Individual specialization in small juveniles was likely to be stronger than sub-adult and adult groups.

This may alter tree allometry, as light regime, water, and nutrient availability can change at the forest edge. Increased root growth may optimize resource uptake and/or enhance tree anchorage to withstand the altered wind regime. However, little is known about the patterns of the root-shoot allometric responses to strip cuttings. In three alpine stands differing in climate, site productivity, and stand characteristics, we selected 71 Norway spruce trees and took increment cores from stems, root collars, and main roots. This enabled us to study changes in the long-term root-stem allometry for 46 years and short-term allometric responses to intervention. The effects of cutting were compared between edge trees and trees from the stand interior in 10 years before and after the intervention. The long-term allocation to roots increased with stem diameter, with the strongest effects on the regularly managed stand with the tallest and largest trees. These results support the allometric biomass partitioning theory, which postulates resource allocation patterns between different plant organs to depend on plant size. Strip cutting on north-facing slopes boosted edge-tree growth in all plant compartments and enhanced allocation to roots. This change in allometry started 2 years after cutting but disappeared 7-8 years later. In the post-cutting period, the highest root-shoot increase was observed in the small trees independent of the site. This indicates the change in growing conditions to have the strongest effects in formerly suppressed trees. Thus, the effect of such acclimation on the wind firmness of subdominant spruce trees is a question with high importance for optimizing cutting layouts in lowering post-cutting vulnerability to disturbance. The results from this case study contribute to a better understanding of the structural acclimation of spruce trees from high-elevation forests to new forest edges.

The amount of Hg released globally in the environment has increased steadily since the Industrial Revolution, resulting in growing contamination in biota. Seabirds have been extensively studied to monitor Hg contamination in the world's oceans. Multidecadal increases in seabird Hg contamination have been documented in polar, temperate and subtropical regions, whereas in tropical regions they are largely unknown. Since seabirds accumulate Hg mainly from their diet, their trophic ecology is fundamental in understanding their Hg exposure over time. Here, we used the sooty tern (Onychoprion fuscatus), the most abundant tropical seabird, as bioindicator of temporal variations in Hg transfer to marine predators in tropical ecosystems, in response to trophic changes and other potential drivers. Body feathers were sampled from 220 sooty terns, from museum specimens (n = 134) and free-living birds (n = 86) from Ascension Island, in the South Atlantic Ocean, over 145 years (1876-2021). Chemical analyses included (i) total- and methyl-Hg, and (ii) carbon (δ(1)³C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) stable isotopes, as proxies of foraging habitat and trophic position, respectively, to investigate the relationship between trophic ecology and Hg contamination over time. Despite current regulations on its global emissions, mean Hg concentrations were 58.9% higher in the 2020s (2.0 μg g(-1), n = 34) than in the 1920s (1.2 μg g(-1), n = 107). Feather Hg concentrations were negatively and positively associated with δ(1)³C and δ(15)N values, respectively. The sharp decline of 2.9 ‰ in δ(1)³C values over time indicates ecosystem-wide changes (shifting primary productivity) in the tropical South Atlantic Ocean and can help explain the observed increase in terns' feather Hg concentrations. Overall, this study provides invaluable information on how ecosystem-wide changes can increase Hg contamination of tropical marine predators and reinforces the need for long-term regulations of harmful contaminants at the global scale.",Animals and Humans and Ecosystem and *Mercury/analysis and Environmental Monitoring/methods and Birds and *Charadriiformes and Atlantic Ocean,2023/03/16 06:00,S0269-7491(23)00189-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121187 [doi],36736563,8804476,FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury),England,Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Claws from bearded and ringed seals store up to 14 and 12 years of sequential analyte data, respectively. These data can be used to compare reproduction, stress and diet across decades. In this study, we compare progesterone, cortisol and carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in female bearded and ringed seals during 1953-1968 (pre-1968, a period prior to sea ice decline) to 1998-2014 (post-1998, a period during sea ice decline). When comparing these periods, bearded seals had statistically higher cortisol concentrations post-1998, and for both species δ(13)C was more negative post-1998, while progesterone and δ(15)N did not change. There was a positive relationship between progesterone and cortisol Z-scores for both species, except for ringed seals post-1998. There was a negative relationship between cortisol Z-scores and δ(13)C for bearded seals evident in post-1998 indicating that higher cortisol Z-scores are associated with more negative δ(13)C in bearded seals in recent years. This negative relationship between cortisol and δ(13)C in bearded seals suggests a shift to higher prey diversity, possibly due to changes in sea ice in the Pacific Arctic evident post 1998. Progesterone Z-scores corresponded to expected differences among non-pregnant, unimplanted, implanted and post-partum individuals. Using these data, pregnancy history was determined for reproductive years for each individual female sampled, which could allow for yearly pregnancy rates to be calculated given a large enough representative sample of the population.

Stilbonematinae are coated by thiotrophic Gammaproteobacteria. As these nematodes migrate through the redox zone, their ectosymbionts experience varying oxygen concentrations. However, nothing is known about how these variations affect their physiology. Here, by applying omics, Raman microspectroscopy, and stable isotope labeling, we investigated the effect of oxygen on ""Candidatus Thiosymbion oneisti."" Unexpectedly, sulfur oxidation genes were upregulated in anoxic relative to oxic conditions, but carbon fixation genes and incorporation of (13)C-labeled bicarbonate were not. Instead, several genes involved in carbon fixation were upregulated under oxic conditions, together with genes involved in organic carbon assimilation, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and urea utilization. Furthermore, in the presence of oxygen, stress-related genes were upregulated together with vitamin biosynthesis genes likely necessary to withstand oxidative stress, and the symbiont appeared to proliferate less. Based on its physiological response to oxygen, we propose that ""Ca. T. oneisti"" may exploit anaerobic sulfur oxidation coupled to denitrification to proliferate in anoxic sand. However, the ectosymbiont would still profit from the oxygen available in superficial sand, as the energy-efficient aerobic respiration would facilitate carbon and nitrogen assimilation. IMPORTANCE Chemoautotrophic endosymbionts are famous for exploiting sulfur oxidization to feed marine organisms with fixed carbon. However, the physiology of thiotrophic bacteria thriving on the surface of animals (ectosymbionts) is less understood. One longstanding hypothesis posits that attachment to animals that migrate between reduced and oxic environments would boost sulfur oxidation, as the ectosymbionts would alternatively access sulfide and oxygen, the most favorable electron acceptor. Here, we investigated the effect of oxygen on the physiology of ""Candidatus Thiosymbion oneisti,"" a gammaproteobacterium which lives attached to marine nematodes inhabiting shallow-water sand. Surprisingly, sulfur oxidation genes were upregulated under anoxic relative to oxic conditions. Furthermore, under anoxia, the ectosymbiont appeared to be less stressed and to proliferate more. We propose that animal-mediated access to oxygen, rather than enhancing sulfur oxidation, would facilitate assimilation of carbon and nitrogen by the ectosymbiont.",NA,2021/06/01 06:01,mSystems01186-20 [pii] and 10.1128/mSystems.01186-20 [doi],34058098,101680636,NA,United States,NA,10.1128/mSystems.01186-20 [doi] and e01186-20,Gammaproteobacteria and Thiosymbion and anoxia and chemosynthesis and sulfur oxidation and symbiosis and thiotrophic bacteria,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,P 28743/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria and P28953/Austrian Science Fund (FWF)/ and P28743/Austrian Science Fund (FWF)/ and DK plus grant W1257: Microbial Nitrogen Cycling/Austrian Science Fund (FWF)/,PMC8269255,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In total, 35 structurally-related (epi)catechin metabolites (SREMs) and 5-carbon side chain ring fission metabolites (5C-RFMs) (phenyl-γ-valerolactones and phenylvaleric acids), and 50 phenolic acid and aromatic catabolites were detected after intakes of both extracts. The consumption of the RWP extract, but not the GSP extract, led to the appearance of a ∼200 nmol L(-1) peak plasma concentration of SREMs formed from flavan-3-ol monomers. In contrast, ingestion of the GSPs, but not the RWPs, resulted in a substantial increase in microbiota-derived 5-carbon side chain ring fission metabolites (5C-RFMs) in plasma. 5C-RFMs, along with low molecular weight phenolic catabolites were detected in urine after ingestion of both extracts. The GSP and RWP extracts had respective mean degrees of polymerisation 5.9 and 6.5 subunits, and the RWP extract had an upper polymer size of 21 subunits compared to 44 subunits for the GSP extract. The differences in plasma metabolite profiles might, therefore, be a consequence of this polydispersity impacting on the microbiota-mediated rates of cleavage of the proanthocyanidin subunits and their subsequent metabolism and absorption. Urinary excretion of phenolic catabolites indicated that 11% of RWPs and 7% for GSPs were subjected to microbial degradation. In all probability these figures, rather than representing the percentage of proanthocyanidins that are completely degraded, indicate partial cleavage of monomer subunits producing a much higher percentage of shortened proanthocyanidin chains. Obtaining more detailed information on the in vivo fate of proanthocyanidins is challenging because of the difficulties in analysing unabsorbed parent proanthocyanidins and their partially degraded flavan-3-ol subunit chains in feces. Further progress awaits the development of improved purification and analytical techniques for proanthocyanidins and their use in feeding studies, and in vitro fecal and bacterial incubations, with radio and/or stable isotope-labelled substrates.","Animals and Biological Availability and Feces/chemistry and Grape Seed Extract/*chemistry and Male and Molecular Structure and Proanthocyanidins/*chemistry and Rats and Rats, Sprague-Dawley and Vitis/*chemistry and Wine/*analysis",2021/03/24 06:00,10.1039/d0fo00350f [doi],32347279,101549033,0 (Grape Seed Extract) and 0 (Grape Seed Proanthocyanidins) and 0 (Proanthocyanidins),England,NA,10.1039/d0fo00350f [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Combining specimens from natural history collections with documents from archival records, we reconstructed the factors surrounding the extinction of the California grizzly bear (Ursus arctos californicus), a once-abundant brown bear subspecies last seen in 1924. Historical documents portrayed California grizzlies as massive hypercarnivores that endangered public safety. Yet, morphological measurements on skulls and teeth generate smaller body size estimates in alignment with extant North American grizzly populations (approx. 200 kg). Stable isotope analysis (δ(13)C, δ(15)N) of pelts and bones (n = 57) revealed that grizzlies derived less than 10% of their nutrition from terrestrial animal sources and were therefore largely herbivorous for millennia prior to the first European arrival in this region in 1542. Later colonial land uses, beginning in 1769 with the Mission era, led grizzlies to moderately increase animal protein consumption (up to 26% of diet), but grizzlies still consumed far less livestock than otherwise claimed by contemporary accounts.

To meet growing demand, we must find ecologically responsible means to control disease and promote crop yields. The root-associated microbiome can aid plants with disease suppression, abiotic stress relief, and nutrient bioavailability. The aim of the present work was to profile the community of bacteria, fungi, and archaea associated with the wheat rhizosphere and root endosphere in different conditions. We also aimed to use (13)CO(2) stable isotope probing (SIP) to identify microbes within the root compartments that were capable of utilising host-derived carbon. RESULTS: Metabarcoding revealed that community composition shifted significantly for bacteria, fungi, and archaea across compartments. This shift was most pronounced for bacteria and fungi, while we observed weaker selection on the ammonia oxidising archaea-dominated archaeal community. Across multiple soil types we found that soil inoculum was a significant driver of endosphere community composition, however, several bacterial families were identified as core enriched taxa in all soil conditions. The most abundant of these were Streptomycetaceae and Burkholderiaceae. Moreover, as the plants senesce, both families were reduced in abundance, indicating that input from the living plant was required to maintain their abundance in the endosphere. Stable isotope probing showed that bacterial taxa within the Burkholderiaceae family, among other core enriched taxa such as Pseudomonadaceae, were able to use root exudates, but Streptomycetaceae were not. CONCLUSIONS: The consistent enrichment of Streptomycetaceae and Burkholderiaceae within the endosphere, and their reduced abundance after developmental senescence, indicated a significant role for these families within the wheat root microbiome. While Streptomycetaceae did not utilise root exudates in the rhizosphere, we provide evidence that Pseudomonadaceae and Burkholderiaceae family taxa are recruited to the wheat root community via root exudates. This deeper understanding crop microbiome formation will enable researchers to characterise these interactions further, and possibly contribute to ecologically responsible methods for yield improvement and biocontrol in the future.",NA,2021/06/23 06:01,10.1186/s40793-021-00381-2 [pii] and 381 [pii] and 10.1186/s40793-021-00381-2 [doi],34154664,101768168,NA,England,NA,10.1186/s40793-021-00381-2 [doi] and 12,Archaea and Endosphere and Exudate and Isotope and Metabarcoding and Microbiome and Root and Senescence and Streptomyces and Wheat,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NE/L002582/1/Natural Environment Research Council/ and NE/L002582/1/Natural Environment Research Council/ and BB/M011216/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United and Kingdom and DH150187/Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Research Fellowship/ and UNITY 852993/ERC_/European Research Council/International,PMC8215762,The authors declare that they have no competing interests.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For all the observational evidence for the benefits of a whole-grain-rich diet, we have only limited knowledge of the mechanisms behind this reduction in disease risk, aside from the action of specific cereal fibres on reduction of blood cholesterol and the post-prandial glucose peak. Nutritional metabolomics, the global measurement and interpretation of metabolic profiles, assesses the interaction of food with the endogenous gene-protein cascade and the gut microbiome. This approach allows the generation of new hypotheses which account for systemic effects, rather than just focusing on one or two mechanisms or metabolic pathways. To date, animal and human trials using metabolomics to investigate mechanistic changes to metabolism on eating whole grains and cereal fractions have led to new hypotheses around mechanistic effects of whole grains. These include the role of cereals as a major source of dietary glycine betaine, a possible effect on phospholipid synthesis or metabolism, the role of branched-chain amino acids and improvements in insulin sensitivity, and the possibility that whole grains may have an effect on protein metabolism.

Increased access to human-associated food items may alter species' foraging behavior and diet, in turn modifying the normal microbial community of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), ultimately impacting their health. It is crucial we understand the role of dietary niche breadth and the resulting shift in the gut microbiota as urban animals navigate novel dietary resources. We combined stable isotope analysis of hair and microbiome analysis of four gut regions across the GIT to investigate the effects of urbanization on the diet and gut microbiota of two sympatric species of rodents with different dietary niches: the omnivorous large Japanese field mouse (Apodemus speciosus) and the relatively more herbivorous gray red-backed vole (Myodes rufocanus). Both species exhibited an expanded dietary niche width within the urban areas potentially attributable to novel anthropogenic foods and altered resource availability. We detected a dietary shift in which urban A. speciosus consumed more terrestrial animal protein and M. rufocanus more plant leaves and stems. Such changes in resource use may be associated with an altered gut microbial community structure. There was an increased abundance of the presumably probiotic Lactobacillus in the small intestine of urban A. speciosus and potentially pathogenic Helicobacter in the colon of M. rufocanus.

Earlier that year, on May 31, the site was struck by a severe storm which rained hailstones exceeding 5.5 cm diameter and spawned an historic 4.2 km-wide tornado <8 km to the south of the site. We hypothesized that this stressor had induced the pallid bands. An assessment of Grasshopper Sparrow nesting phenology indicated that a large number of nestlings were likely growing tail feathers when the storm hit. The pallid bands were restricted to the distal half of feathers and their widths significantly increased as a function of distance from the tip (i.e., age at formation). We predicted that if stress had caused these pallid bands, then a spike in circulating δ (15)N originating from tissue catabolism during the stress response would have been incorporated into the developing feather. From 18 juveniles captured at the site in August we measured δ (15)N and δ (13)C stable isotope ratios within four to five 0.25-0.40 mg feather sections taken from the distal end of a tail feather; the pallid band, if present, was contained within only one section. After accounting for individual and across-section variation, we found support for our prediction that feather sections containing or located immediately proximal to pallid bands (i.e., the pallid band region) would show significantly higher δ (15)N than sections outside this region. In contrast, the feathers of juveniles with pallid bands compared to normal appearing juveniles showed significantly lower δ (15)N. A likely explanation is that the latter individuals hatched after the May 31 storm and had consumed a trophically-shifted diet relative to juveniles with pallid bands. Considering this, the juveniles of normal appearance were significantly less abundant within our sample relative to expectations from past cohorts (z = - 2.03; p = 0.042) and, in as much, suggested widespread nest losses during the storm.

In the present work, we developed an analytical method to quantify 20 free amino acids in aqueous soil extracts without derivatization. The method employed hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) technique combined with a cation exchange solid phase extraction (SPE). Four stable isotope labelled amino acids were used as internal standards to improve the method performance. Good separation of 20 underivatized amino acids was achieved within 12min. The limit of detection (LODs) and limit of quantification (LOQs) were in the range of 13-384ngg(-1) and 43-1267ngg(-1) (dry soil basis), respectively. The results showed that overall recoveries with high precision were obtained for the extracted free amino acids from ten different soils. The overall recoveries of 18 amino acids were similar for the ten soils used, which differed substantially in organic C content and in other properties as soil texture and pH. For most of the amino acids, the average recoveries from soil extracts were between 74% and 117%, with the exception of Met (31%), Pro (52%) and Arg (68%).

In order to increase understanding of urban ecohydrology, we investigated the variability of planktonic bacteria and benthic diatoms - as two key biological indicators - coupled with insights from hydrochemistry and stable water isotopes across four urban streams characterized by different dominant water sources in Berlin, the German capital, over a period of one year (2021-2022). DNA metabarcoding results show that substantial spatio-temporal variability exists across urban streams in terms of microbial diversity and richness, with clear links to abiotic factors and nutrient concentrations. Bacterial communities showed clear distinction between effluent-impacted and non-effluent impacted streams as well as clear seasonal turnover. In-stream benthic diatom assemblages also showed robust seasonal variation as well as high species diversity. Our multiple-tracer approach is relevant for emerging questions regarding the increased use of treated effluent to supplement declining baseflows, the assessment of stream restoration projects and the impact of storm drainage and surface pollution on aquatic ecosystem health. eDNA analysis allows analysis of spatial and temporal patterns not feasibly studied with traditional analyses of macroinvertebrates.

Palaeoenvironmental modelling of δ(13) C and δ(15) N values is crucial in determining whether changes in the stable isotope values are a result of dietary change, rather than temporal or geographical fluctuations in carbon and nitrogen. Investigating faunal dietary behaviour can provide an insight into past foddering and land management strategies. METHODS: Detailed sampling of wild and domestic species for bulk collagen analysis was undertaken in order to characterise geographical variations in δ(13) C and δ(15) N values in the Outer Hebrides and Orkney. Samples from the Neolithic to the Norse period were analysed to assess temporal and geographical variations in δ(13) C and δ(15) N values, in addition to determining the contribution of marine foods to the diet of local fauna. RESULTS: A δ(15) N shift of 1‰ was observed between the Outer Hebrides and Orkney in the Neolithic and Iron Age. A geographical variation in δ(13) C values was observed in the Norse period between Orkney and the Outer Hebrides. Temporal fluctuations in δ(13) C and δ(15) N values demonstrate variations in foddering practices of sheep in the Outer Hebrides. Pig specimens from the Outer Hebrides demonstrated evidence of marine food consumption in the Iron Age. CONCLUSIONS: Faunal dietary behaviour can act as a vital indicator of the importance of marine resources in the past. Characterisation of faunal δ(13) C and δ(15) N values geographically and temporally is crucial in our interpretation of human dietary behaviour.",NA,2012/09/15 06:01,10.1002/rcm.6319 [doi],22976206,8802365,NA,England,"Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10.1002/rcm.6319 [doi],NA,NA,NA,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Siberian archaeological record evidences other critical shifts in dog foraging and diet that likely characterize Holocene dogs globally. By the Middle Holocene, body size reconstruction for Siberia dogs indicates that most were far smaller than Pleistocene wolves. This contributed to dogs' tendencies to scavenge, feed on small prey, and reduce social foraging. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of Siberian dogs reveals that their diets were more diverse than those of Pleistocene wolves. This included habitual consumption of marine and freshwater foods by the Middle Holocene and reliance on C(4) foods by the Late Holocene. Feeding on such foods and anthropogenic waste increased dogs' exposure to microbes, affected their gut microbiomes, and shaped long-term dog population history.",NA,2022/07/23 06:01,10.1126/sciadv.abo6493 [doi],35867782,101653440,NA,United States,NA,10.1126/sciadv.abo6493 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Peat mining adversely affects the methanotrophs, but activity and community composition/abundances may recover after restoration. Considering that the methanotrophic activity and growth are significantly stimulated in the presence of other microorganisms, the methane-driven interaction network, encompassing methanotrophs and non-methanotrophs (i.e., methanotrophic interactome), may also be relevant in conferring community resilience. Yet, little is known of the response and recovery of the methanotrophic interactome to disturbances. Here, we determined the recovery of the methanotrophic interactome as inferred by a co-occurrence network analysis, comparing a pristine and restored peatland. We coupled a DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP) approach using (13)C-CH(4) to a co-occurrence network analysis derived from the (13)C-enriched 16S rRNA gene sequences to relate the response in methanotrophic activity to the structuring of the interaction network. Methanotrophic activity and abundances recovered after peat restoration since 2000. 'Methylomonaceae' was the predominantly active methanotrophs in both peatlands, but differed in the relative abundance of Methylacidiphilaceae and Methylocystis However, bacterial community composition was distinct in both peatlands. Likewise, the methanotrophic interactome was profoundly altered in the restored peatland. Structuring of the interaction network after peat mining resulted in the loss of complexity and modularity, indicating a less connected and efficient network, which may have consequences in the event of recurring/future disturbances. Therefore, determining the response of the methane-driven interaction network, in addition to relating methanotrophic activity to community composition/abundances, provided a more comprehensive understanding of the resilience of the methanotrophs.Importance The resilience and recovery of microorganisms from disturbances are often determined with regard to their activity and community composition/abundances. Rarely has the response of the network of interacting microorganisms been considered, despite accumulating evidence showing that microbial interaction modulates community functioning. Comparing the methane-driven interaction network of a pristine and restored peatland, our findings revealed that the metabolically active microorganisms were less connected and formed less modular 'hubs' in the restored peatland, indicative of a less complex network which may have consequences with recurring disturbances and environmental changes. This also suggests that the resilience and full recovery in the methanotrophic activity and abundances do not reflect on the interaction network. Therefore, it is relevant to consider the interaction-induced response, in addition to documenting changes in activity and community composition/abundances, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the resilience of microorganisms to disturbances.",NA,2020/12/24 06:01,AEM.02355-20 [pii] and 02355-20 [pii] and 10.1128/AEM.02355-20 [doi],33355115,7605801,NA,United States,Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.,AEM.02355-20 [pii] and 10.1128/AEM.02355-20 [doi] and e02355-20,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,PMC8090869,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
