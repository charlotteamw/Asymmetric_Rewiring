Article,Tyler D. Tunney and Kevin S. McCann and Nigel P. Lester and Brian J. Shuter,Effects of differential habitat warming on complex communities,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA",2014,111,22,8077-8082,JUN 3,"Food webs unfold across a mosaic of micro and macro habitats, with each
   habitat coupled by mobile consumers that behave in response to local
   environmental conditions. Despite this fundamental characteristic of
   nature, research on how climate change will affect whole ecosystems has
   overlooked (i) that climate warming will generally affect habitats
   differently and (ii) that mobile consumers may respond to this
   differential change in a manner that may fundamentally alter the energy
   pathways that sustain ecosystems. This reasoning suggests a powerful,
   but largely unexplored, avenue for studying the impacts of climate
   change on ecosystem functioning. Here, we use lake ecosystems to show
   that predictable behavioral adjustments to local temperature
   differentials govern a fundamental structural shift across 54 food webs.
   Data show that the trophic pathways from basal resources to a
   cold-adapted predator shift toward greater reliance on a cold-water
   refuge habitat, and food chain length increases, as air temperatures
   rise. Notably, cold-adapted predator behavior may substantially drive
   this decoupling effect across the climatic range in our study
   independent of warmer-adapted species responses (for example, changes in
   near-shore species abundance and predator absence). Such modifications
   reflect a flexible food web architecture that requires more attention
   from climate change research. The trophic pathway restructuring
   documented here is expected to alter biomass accumulation, through the
   regulation of energy fluxes to predators, and thus potentially threatens
   ecosystem sustainability in times of rapid environmental change.",NATL ACAD SCIENCES,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",Article,English,"Tunney, TD (Corresponding Author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.

Article,Michelle J. Greenwood,"More than a barrier: The complex effects of ecotone vegetation type on
   terrestrial consumer consumption of an aquatic prey resource",AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,2014,39,8,941-951,DEC,"Community structure and dynamics can be influenced by resource transfers
   between ecosystems, yet little is known about how boundary structure
   determines both the magnitude of exchanges and their effects on
   recipient and donor communities. Aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are
   often linked by resource fluxes and riparian vegetation is commonly
   affected by anthropogenic alterations to land use or river hydrological
   regime. I investigated whether shrubs at the freshwater-terrestrial
   interface alter the supply, distribution and importance of aquatic prey
   resources to terrestrial consumers. Shrubs were predicted to alter the
   larval community composition of aquatic insects and the emergence of
   winged adults, thus affecting aquatic prey subsidies to terrestrial
   consumers. In addition, shrubs were hypothesized to alter the
   microclimatic suitability of the riparian zone for adult aquatic
   insects, act as a physical barrier to their dispersal and affect
   terrestrial community composition, particularly the abundance and type
   of predators that could benefit from the aquatic prey resource. Stable
   isotope dietary analyses and a survey of shrub-dominated and open
   grassland riparian habitats revealed that larval densities of aquatic
   insects (EPTM: Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Megaloptera)
   were higher in shrub than grassland habitats; however, reduced emergence
   and lateral dispersal in shrub areas led to lower densities of adults.
   The temperature and relative humidity of the riparian zone did not
   differ between the habitats. Ground-active terrestrial invertebrate
   communities had a higher proportion of cursorial spiders in grassland,
   coinciding with greater abundances of aquatic prey. Aquatic prey
   contribution to cursorial spider diet matched adult aquatic insect
   abundances. Overall, riparian shrubs reduced the magnitude, or at least
   altered the timing, of cross-ecosystem subsidy supply, distribution and
   use by consumers through mechanisms operating in both the aquatic and
   terrestrial ecosystems. Thus, the structure of ecosystem boundaries has
   complex effects on the strength of biological interactions between
   adjacent systems.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Greenwood, MJ (Corresponding Author), Natl Inst Water \& Atmospher Res, 10 Kyle St, Christchurch 8011, New Zealand.

   high-latitude lake communities to concurrent `greening' and `browning'",ECOLOGY LETTERS,2019,22,5,807-816,MAY,"Climate change and the intensification of land use practices are causing
   widespread eutrophication of subarctic lakes. The implications of this
   rapid change for lake ecosystem function remain poorly understood. To
   assess how freshwater communities respond to such profound changes in
   their habitat and resource availability, we conducted a space-for-time
   analysis of food-web structure in 30 lakes situated across a
   temperature-productivity gradient equivalent to the predicted future
   climate of subarctic Europe (temperature +3 degrees C, precipitation
   +30\% and nutrient +45 mu g L-1 total phosphorus). Along this gradient,
   we observed an increase in the assimilation of pelagic-derived carbon
   from 25 to 75\% throughout primary, secondary and tertiary consumers.
   This shift was overwhelmingly driven by the consumption of pelagic
   detritus by benthic primary consumers and was not accompanied by
   increased pelagic foraging by higher trophic level consumers. Our data
   also revealed a convergence of the carbon isotope ratios of pelagic and
   benthic food web endmembers in the warmest, most productive lakes
   indicating that the incorporation of terrestrial derived carbon into
   aquatic food webs increases as land use intensifies. These results,
   reflecting changes along a gradient characteristic of the predicted
   future environment throughout the subarctic, indicate that climate and
   land use driven eutrophication and browning are radically altering the
   function and fuelling of aquatic food webs in this biome.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Hayden, B (Corresponding Author), Univ New Brunswick, Canadian Rivers Inst, Dept Biol, Fredericton, NB, Canada.

   streams",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,2020,34,8,1653-1665,AUG,"Land use intensification and climate change are two prominent drivers of
   variation in biological communities. However, we know very little about
   how these two potential environmental stressors interact. Here we use a
   stable isotope approach to quantify how animal communities respond to
   urban and agriculture land use, and to latitudinal variation in climate
   (rainfall and temperature), in 29 streams across South Africa. Community
   structure was shaped by both land use and climatic factors. The
   taxonomic diversity of invertebrates was best explained by an
   independent negative effect of urbanization, while abundance declined in
   summer. However, we could not use our variables to predict fish
   diversity (suggesting that other factors may be more important). Both
   trophic functional diversity (quantifed usingisotopic richness) and food
   chain length declined with increasing temperature. Functional redundancy
   (quantifed usingisotopic uniqueness) in the invertebrate community was
   high in wet areas, and a synergistic interaction with urbanization
   caused the lowest values in dry urban regions. There was an additive
   effect of agriculture and rainfall on abundance-weighted vertebrate
   functional diversity (quantified usingisotopic dispersion), with the
   former causing a decline in dispersion, with this partially compensated
   for by high rainfall. In most cases, we found that a single dominant
   driver (either climate or land use) explained variation between streams.
   We only found two incidences of combined effects improving the model,
   one of which was amplified (i.e. the drivers combined to cause an effect
   larger than the sum of their independent effects), indicating that
   management should first focus on mitigating the dominant stressor in
   stream ecosystems for successful restoration efforts. Overall, our study
   indicates subtle food web responses to multiple drivers of change, only
   identified by using functional isotope metrics-these are a useful tool

   functions of tropical ecosystems. It has been shown that conversion of
   rainforest into plantations erodes biodiversity, but further
   consequences for food-web structure and energetics of belowground
   communities remains little explored. We used a unique combination of
   stable isotope analysis and food-web energetics to analyze in a
   comprehensive way consequences of the conversion of rainforest into oil
   palm and rubber plantations on the structure of and channeling of energy
   through soil animal food webs in Sumatra, Indonesia. Across the animal
   groups studied, most of the taxa had lower litter-calibrated \&
   UDelta;C-13 values in plantations than in rainforests, suggesting that
   they switched to freshly-fixed plant carbon ('fast' energy channeling)
   in plantations from the detrital C pathway ('slow' energy channeling) in
   rainforests. These shifts led to changes in isotopic divergence,
   dispersion, evenness, and uniqueness. However, earthworms as major
   detritivores stayed unchanged in their trophic niche and monopolized the
   detrital pathway in plantations, resulting in similar energetic metrics
   across land-use systems. Functional diversity metrics of soil food webs
   were associated with reduced amount of litter, tree density, and species
   richness in plantations, providing guidelines on how to improve the

   aquatic-terrestrial linkages along streams arising from changes in the
   emergence of aquatic insects. We expected that terrestrial predators
   would respond to a change in the abundance and/or the size structure of
   the emerging aquatic insects by an increase or decrease in population
   size. We measured the flux of emergent aquatic insects and the abundance
   of terrestrial invertebrate predators and birds along 10 streams across
   a forest-to-agriculture land-use gradient. We also performed stable
   isotope analyses (hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen) of terrestrial
   invertebrate predators. Small aquatic insects (Nematocera) were most
   abundant under agricultural land use, whereas larger bodied aquatic
   insects (Plecoptera and Trichoptera) were more associated with forest
   land use. Carabid beetles and linyphiid spiders were associated with
   agricultural streams (where there was a high abundance of small aquatic
   insects), whereas lycosid spiders and birds were associated with forest
   streams and a high abundance of large-sized aquatic insects. The
   contribution of aquatic insects to the diets of riparian Lycosidae,
   Linyphiidae and Carabidae was estimated to be 44\%, 60\% and 43\%,
   respectively, indicating the importance of aquatic subsidies to the
   terrestrial system. Our results show that agricultural land use in an
   overall forested landscape can have significant effects on the abundance
   and diet of terrestrial consumers through its impact on the size
   structure of the assemblage of emerging insects, rather than the overall
   magnitude (numbers) of the aquatic subsidy. Hence, our results suggest

   the land-sea interface result in a number of ecological consequences.
   Migratory animals that move across ecosystems drive a number of these
   spatial subsidies (e.g. anadromous salmon), but many of the world's
   animal migrations are in decline. The cross-ecosystem reach of Pacific
   herring Clupea pallasii, a migratory, iteroparous forage fish that
   spawns along the coastlines of the North Pacific Ocean, has never been
   studied. Spawn events represent large aggregations of biomass and
   energy, a portion of which is transferred to intertidal and supratidal
   zones. Using fatty acids and stable isotopic signatures of carbon and
   nitrogen, we (1) traced the sources of production and (2) tested the
   hypothesis that herring subsidizes detritivorous, semi-terrestrial
   amphipods (Talitridae: Traskorchestia spp.), which are often abundant in
   intertidal and supratidal zones. Amphipods and likely dietary items
   (macrophytes and herring eggs) were collected from 5 beaches before and
   after herring spawned in Quatsino Sound, British Columbia. Combined with
   the use of mixing models, stable isotopes suggest that herring, in
   addition to brown algae and seagrass, were major sources of production
   during the study period. Fatty acid results suggest that brown algae is
   generally a major dietary resource for amphipods, but herring eggs
   provide important omega-3 fatty acids that are low in abundance prior to
   herring spawn events. Taken together, we provide corroborative evidence
   of a previously unknown cross-ecosystem spatial subsidy by Pacific
   herring. Further, because amphipods are prey for several terrestrial
   consumers, we also identify previously unknown marine-terrestrial

   basal energy in agricultural streams",AQUATIC SCIENCES,2022,84,4,NA,OCT,"We examined food web structure in headwater streams to determine whether
   riparian buffers can mitigate the effects of agricultural land use on
   stream ecosystem function. Study sites were located in the Midwestern US
   and divided into three land use groups (forested, buffered,
   agricultural) based on the amount of riparian forest and row crop
   agriculture in the watershed. Stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and
   delta(15) N) was performed on basal energy sources and consumers (6
   invertebrate groups and 7 fish species) with isotopic metrics used to
   assess variation in food web structure related to land use, instream
   environmental parameters, and food resources. Land use differences were
   associated with community-wide isotopic shifts with all trophic
   diversity metrics greater in forested compared to agricultural streams,
   whereas buffered streams were generally intermediate. Agricultural
   streams had compressed food webs with high trophic redundancy indicative
   of a shared resource pool for all consumers. In contrast, forested and
   buffered stream food webs showed larger trophic niche area due to
   greater utilization of detrital energy and higher variability in trophic
   position among invertebrates and fish. Circular statistics revealed fish
   communities shifted to lower trophic positions and increased dependence
   on periphyton production in agricultural streams. The presence of
   riparian forests was associated with a broader range of resources used
   by consumers, expanded trophic diversity, and elevated fish trophic
   position in buffered streams. Results suggest that riparian forests can
   improve food web structure in streams impacted by croplands and provide
   further support for restoring buffer areas to moderate adverse effects

   considerable anthropogenic disturbance due to dam construction and water
   diversion. Disturbance is known to impact community structure, but its
   effect on food chain length is still a matter of considerable debate.
   Theoretical models show that longer food chains are less resilient to
   disturbance, so food chain length is predicted to be shorter following a
   disturbance event. Here we experimentally test the effect of disturbance
   on food chain length in streams by diverting stream flow. We found that
   our experimental low-flow disturbance did not alter food chain length.
   We did see an effect on body-size structure in our food webs suggesting
   that food chain length may be an insensitive indicator of disturbance.
   We suggest that habitat heterogeneity and food web complexity buffer the
   effect of disturbance on food chain length. The theoretical predictions

   and aquatic energy subsides to maintain a productive and stable food
   web. Land use around streams can have strong effects on the size and
   availability of resource subsidies for stream and riparian predators

   the establishment of forested buffers to protect aquatic and riparian
   ecosystems from upland disturbances. Buffer size may determine prey
   abundance, richness, and spatial extent of prey reach into both the
   aquatic and terrestrial systems. To test the effects of forested buffers
   subsidy direction, we explored the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope
   signatures of brown trout (Salmo trutta), Tetragnathidae and Lycosidae
   spiders, and their aquatic and terrestrial prey sources around twelve
   streams in southern Sweden. For both predator groups, buffer presence
   showed no effect on resource subsidy source. We found that both brown
   trout and spiders are significantly reliant on terrestrial sources of
   prey for their diets in the fall. To support the terrestrial subsidy

   anthropogenic stressors including climate change, disconnection between
   the main river channel and floodplain, flow regulation, and land-use
   modification. Viewed through a resilience lens, these ecosystems are
   potentially in a new regime, exhibiting a different structure, function,
   and set of feedbacks. We investigated the trophic status and food web
   character response to anthropogenic stressors over 150 years in the
   Illinois River. Differences in stable isotope ratios, community niche
   space, basal resource contribution to higher levels in the food web,
   mean trophic position of fish functional feeding guilds, and food chain
   length among four stressor phases suggest changes in ecosystem function
   in the Illinois River. Moreover, the river did not return to
   pre-stressor conditions following watershed-wide restoration efforts.
   Differences in trophic status and food web character also varied between
   the upper- and lower-river zones of the Illinois River over time. This
   spatial divergence further highlights the complexity of responses to
   multiple stressors in this ecosystem. Overall, differences in trophic
   status and food web character suggest a shift to a new regime-an
   Anthropocene regime-and one that has a reduced capacity to absorb
   additional disturbances. Given human pressures are a global issue, our

   response to pervasive and intensifying land use have the potential to
   alter the consumer-resource interactions and to rewire the flow of
   energy through entire food webs. We investigated these structural and
   functional properties of food webs in stream ecosystems distributed
   across woodland, agricultural and urban areas in the Zagreb region of
   Croatia. We compared resource availability and consumer diet composition
   using stable isotope mixing models and tested how the isotopic variance
   of basal resources, primary consumers, macroinvertebrate predators and
   other food web characteristics change with different land-use types.
   Combination of increased loading and altered composition of nutrients,
   lower water discharge and higher light availability at urban sites
   likely promoted the contribution of aquatic macrophytes to diets of
   primary consumers. Macroinvertebrate predators shifted their diet,
   relying more on active filterers at urban sites relative to woodland and
   agricultural sites. Urban food webs also had lower trophic redundancy
   (i.e. fewer species at each trophic level) and a more homogenized energy
   flow from lower to higher trophic levels. There was no effect of land
   use on isotopic variation of basal resources, primary consumers or
   macroinvertebrate predators, but all these trophic groups at urban and
   agricultural sites were N-15-enriched relative to their counterparts in
   woodland stream food webs. The physical and chemical ecosystem
   characteristics associated with intensive land use altered the resource
   availability, trophic redundancy and the flow of energy to other trophic
   levels, with potentially negative consequences for community dynamics

   Sea-Ice Coverage",FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,2020,7,NA,NA,DEC 11,"Determining food web architecture and its seasonal cycles is a
   precondition for making predictions about Antarctic marine biodiversity
   under varying climate change scenarios. However, few scientific data
   concerning Antarctic food web structure, the species playing key roles
   in web stability and the community responses to changes in sea-ice
   dynamics are available. Based on C and N stable isotope analysis, we
   describe Antarctic benthic food webs and the diet of species occurring
   in shallow waters (Tethys Bay, Ross Sea) before and after seasonal
   sea-ice break-up. We hypothesized that the increased availability of
   primary producers (sympagic algae) following sea-ice break-up affects
   the diet of species and thus food web architecture. Basal resources had
   distinct isotopic signatures that did not change after sea-ice break-up,
   enabling a robust description of consumer diets based on Bayesian mixing
   models. Sympagic algae had the highest delta C-13 (similar to-14 parts
   per thousand) and red macroalgae the lowest (similar to-37 parts per
   thousand). Consumer isotopic niches and signatures changed after sea-ice
   break-up, reflecting the values of sympagic algae. Differences in food
   web topology were also observed. The number of taxa and the number of
   links per taxon were higher before the thaw than after it. After sea-ice
   break-up, sympagic inputs allowed consumers to specialize on abundant
   resources at lower trophic levels. Foraging optimization by consumers
   led to a simpler food web, with lower potential competition and shorter
   food chains. However, basal resources and Antarctic species such as the
   bivalve Adamussium colbecki and the sea-urchin Sterechinus neumayeri
   were central and highly connected both before and after the seaice
   break-up, thus playing key roles in interconnecting species and
   compartments in the web. Any disturbance affecting these species is
   expected to have cascading effects on the entire food web. The seasonal
   break-up of sea ice in Antarctica ensures the availability of resources
   that are limiting for coastal communities for the rest of the year.
   Identification of species playing a key role in regulating food web
   structure in relation to seasonal sea-ice dynamics, which are expected
   to change with global warming, is central to understanding how these

   midsize river system",FRESHWATER SCIENCE,2016,35,3,895-908,SEP,"Food-chain length (FCL) is a key factor underlying patterns of energy
   flow and trophic structure in food webs. Natural gradients in resource
   availability, ecosystem size, and disturbance are thought to govern FCL
   in rivers. However, anthropogenic influences on FCL, including landscape
   modification (e.g., land-cover change) and river regulation (e.g.,
   dams), remain unresolved. From 2010 to 2013 we characterized fish food
   webs at 12 river reaches along an 185-km section of the 6th-order Scioto
   River system (Ohio, USA) to assess the effects of natural and
   anthropogenic factors and the potential influence of shifts in foodweb
   structure (e.g., diversity, top predator body size, intermediate
   predator richness) on fish FCL. Stable isotope-derived estimates of FCL
   ranged from 3.66 to 4.35, which are comparable to global values of FCL
   in rivers. A model-selection approach returned a set of linear
   regression models that explained 38 to 74\% of the variation in FCL.
   Local ecosystem size (i.e., channel width) was positively related to FCL
   and was the most common predictor in the model set. Total dissolved
   solids, riparian agricultural land cover, and drainage area were all
   positively associated with FCL, whereas developed land cover (i.e.,
   urban) was negatively related to FCL. In addition, FCL was significantly
   lower in impounded vs free-flowing reaches. Impounded reaches had fewer
   top-predator taxa, reduced fish diversity, and notable shifts in
   assemblage composition. Overall, we interpret these results to suggest
   that although natural physical factors have strong influences on FCL in
   rivers, human alterations can be important determinants of FCL in
   regulated river systems. In particular, disruption of hydrogeomorphic
   gradients may integrate changes in energy flow and foodweb architecture,
   thereby shortening FCL and potentially destabilizing food webs.",UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",Article,English,"Kautza, A (Corresponding Author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm \& Nat Resources, 2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.

   and incidence of low-flow extremes resulting from global climate change
   and a growing human demand for freshwater resources. Although it is
   unknown how and to what extent riverine communities will change in the
   face of these threats, considerable insight will be gained from efforts
   aimed at quantifying habitat size-related controls on the trophic
   relationships among taxa in streams experiencing extreme flow loss. Here
   we report on a detailed space-for-time survey of replicate stream food
   webs sampled along the perennial- to-drying continuum in each of
   fourteen different intermittent South Island, New Zealand streams. We
   quantified several structural attributes of food webs at fifty-eight
   sites, including two taxonomically-based metrics (web size,
   predator:prey ratio) and three stable isotope-based metrics (food chain
   length {[}FCL], trophic area, C-13 range); we also quantified habitat
   size-, disturbance-, and resource-related covariates at each site. Food
   web structure varied widely across sample sites within and across study
   streams and much of this variation was explained by habitat size.
   Consistent with our predictions, we found that food webs became smaller
   (ca 30 to ca 15 taxa, ca 20-fold reduction in stable isotope-based
   trophic area) and shorter (maximum trophic position {[}FCL] from 4.1 to
   2.0, 25\% reduction in predator:prey ratio) as we moved from the largest
   to smaller habitats. These results, and a comparison of our findings
   with those from a similar assessment conducted in perennial streams,
   suggest that there are perturbation thresholds which may trigger food
   web collapse when exceeded, and further imply that food webs may
   ultimately be sized' to minimum flows rather than average flow
   conditions. Our work provides a basis for making general predictions
   about how habitat contraction, and flow loss in particular, may affect

Muir and Nigel Lester and Brian Shuter and Neil Rooney,The adaptive capacity of lake food webs: from individuals to ecosystems,ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,2016,86,1,4-19,FEB,"Aquatic ecosystems support size structured food webs, wherein
   predator-prey body sizes span orders of magnitude. As such, these food
   webs are replete with extremely generalized feeding strategies,
   especially among the larger bodied, higher trophic position taxa. The
   movement scale of aquatic organisms also generally increases with body
   size and trophic position. Together, these body size, mobility, and
   foraging relationships suggest that organisms lower in the food web
   generate relatively distinct energetic pathways by feeding over smaller
   spatial areas. Concurrently, the potential capacity for generalist
   foraging and spatial coupling of these pathways often increases, on
   average, moving up the food web toward higher trophic levels. We argue
   that these attributes make for a food web architecture that is
   inherently `adaptive' in its response to environmental conditions. This
   is because variation in lower trophic level dynamics is dampened by the
   capacity of predators to flexibly alter their foraging behavior. We
   argue that empirical, theoretical, and applied research needs to embrace
   this inherently adaptive architecture if we are to understand the
   relationship between structure and function in the face of ongoing
   environmental change. Toward this goal, we discuss empirical patterns in
   the structure of lake food webs to suggest that ecosystems change
   consistently, from individual traits to the structure of whole food
   webs, under changing environmental conditions. We then explore an
   empirical example to reveal that explicitly unfolding the mechanisms
   that drive these adaptive responses offers insight into how human-driven
   impacts, such as climate change, invasive species, and fisheries
   harvest, ought to influence ecosystem structure and function (e.g.,
   stability, secondary productivity, maintenance of major energy
   pathways). We end by arguing that such a directed food web research
   program promises a powerful across-scale framework for more effective
   ecosystem monitoring and management.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"McMeans, BC (Corresponding Author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.

   regime shifts",OECOLOGIA,2014,175,1,231-241,MAY,"Ecological regime shifts typically result in abrupt changes in ecosystem
   structure through several trophic levels, which leads to rapid ecosystem
   reconfiguration between regimes. An interesting aspect of the impact of
   regime shift is that alternative regimes may induce distinct shifts in
   energy pathways; these have been less tested than structural changes.
   This paper addresses this by using stable isotopes to establish the
   energy pathways in fish communities. We specifically focus on the impact
   of regime shift on changes of the energy pathways, and how the magnitude
   and direction of these changes affect the local community. We found that
   energy pathways significantly varied among the planktivorous,
   benthivorous, and piscivorous trophic guilds as a result of the
   alternative regimes. The regime shift from a clear to a turbid state
   altered the food web towards planktonic energy pathways and truncated
   food chain length, which is indicative of less ecological efficiency.
   This was confirmed by the adaptive foraging strategies of prevalent
   omnivores in the current communities. These structural and functional
   characteristics of trophic interactions might not facilitate classic
   trophic cascading effects in such a turbid regime and suppress the
   system's response to environmental changes, e.g., nutrient loading, and
   restoration efforts in turbid to clear water regime shifts.",SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",Article,English,"Xu, J (Corresponding Author), Wuhan Univ, Donghu Expt Stn Lake Ecosyst, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol \& Biotechnol China, Inst Hydrobiol, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.

   Capitalizing on this spectacular bioinvasion, we used stable isotope
   analysis to depict the novel fish food web occurring in the Eastern
   Mediterranean, off the Lebanese coast. Multivariate analyses were
   performed on six trophic groups contrasting the delta N-15-delta C-13
   ratios of native (MED) versus non-indigenous (Lessepsian-LES) species.
   Community-wide aspects of trophic structure were explored by means of
   recently developed quantitative metrics, such as the average distance to
   centroid and the standard ellipse area. Although the trophic positions
   of Lessepsian and native species were comparable, native fishes
   generally showed a greater trophic diversity than Lessepsians, the
   latter being mainly located in the central region of the available
   trophic space. We argue that the original trophic niche of native
   species has widened out due to the shift they have made towards less
   preferred food items, whilst highly competitive invaders are exploiting
   more energetic resources. In the absence of historical data, our

   increasing biomass of primary producers. However, interactive effects of
   both stressors on the structure and trophic basis of food webs remain
   unknown. We hypothesized that the interaction between both stressors
   increases the contribution of the green pathway in stream food webs.
   Given the key role of the high-quality, but less abundant, primary
   producers, we also hypothesized an increase in food web complexity with
   larger trophic diversity in the presence of water diversion and
   pollution. To test these hypotheses, we selected four rivers in a range
   of pollution subject to similar water diversion schemes, and we compared
   food webs upstream and downstream of the diversion. We characterized
   food webs by means of stable isotope analysis. Both stressors directly
   changed the availability of basal resources, with water diversion
   affecting the brown food web by decreasing detritus stocks, and
   pollution enhancing the green food web by promoting biofilm production.
   The propagation of the effects at the base of the food web to higher
   trophic levels differed between stressors. Water diversion had little
   effect on the structure of food webs, but pollution increased food chain
   length and trophic diversity, and reduced trophic redundancy. The
   effects at higher trophic levels were exacerbated when combining both
   stressors, as the relative contribution of biofilm to the stock of basal
   resources increased even further. Overall, we conclude that moderate
   pollution increases food web complexity and that the interaction with
   water abstraction seems to amplify this effect. Our study shows the
   importance of assessing the interaction between stressors to create
   predictive tools for a proper management of ecosystems.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Guzman, I (Corresponding Author), Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Sci \& Technol, Dept Plant Biol \& Ecol, Barrio Sarriena S-N, Leioa 48940, Spain.

Article,Sebastian Steibl and Gerhard Gebauer and Christian Laforsch,"Impacts on food web properties of island invertebrate communities vary
   between different human land uses",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,2022,831,NA,NA,JUL 20,"Human land use is of growing concern for island ecosystems. Besides
   direct impacts on biodiversity, land uses can alter the functioning and
   structure of ecosystems. Central to this are impacts on food webs. The
   release of additional nutrients from human origin, habitat
   homogenization, or environmental filtering due to human land use can
   change the diet of individual consumer species (i.e., their trophic
   niches) and the distribution and overlap of trophic niches within a food
   web. However, it remains largely unclear whether the effects on food web
   properties vary between the different and predominant human land uses
   present on islands. Here, we investigated the impact of two dominant
   human land uses on small oceanic islands (i.e., urban and tourism
   development) and tested if and how different land uses on islands affect
   food web structure. To disentangle human land uses, we investigated
   islands, which were either privately owned by a tourist facility (i.e.,
   exclusively tourism land use) or experienced urban development from the
   local population (i.e., urban land use), or remained uninhabited,
   serving as reference sites free of direct land use. Using stable isotope
   analysis, we show that isotope signature, trophic (isotopic) niches, and
   overall food web properties of the investigated island invertebrate
   communities were significantly changed under both land use regimes.
   While trophic diversity was reduced and trophic niche widths increased
   under tourism land use, the investigated food webs showed reduced
   trophic diversity at the food web base and a more uneven trophic niche
   distribution under urban land use. In summary, these findings show that
   different human land uses can have contrasting impacts on oceanic island
   food webs. As oceanic islands experience rapidly growing human land
   conversion, our results indicate that they may also face increasing yet
   unpredictable long-term changes in food web dynamics.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Laforsch, C (Corresponding Author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Ecol 1, Univ Str 30, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.

Article,Ruth Rawcliffe and Carl D. Sayer and Guy Woodward and Jonathan Grey and Thomas A. Davidson and J. Iwan Jones,"Back to the future: using palaeolimnology to infer long-term changes in
   shallow lake food webs",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2010,55,3,600-613,MAR,"P>1. Shallow lakes are often cited as classic examples of systems that
   exhibit trophic cascades but, whilst they provide good model systems
   with which to test general ecological theory and to assess long-term
   community change, their food web linkages have rarely been resolved, so
   changes associated with the structure and dynamics of the ecological
   network as a whole are still poorly understood.
   2. We sought to redress this, and to demonstrate the potential benefits
   of integrating palaeolimnological and contemporary data, by constructing
   highly resolved food webs and stable isotope derived measures of trophic
   interactions and niche space, for the extant communities of two shallow
   U.K. lakes from different positions along a gradient of eutrophication.
   The contemporary surface sediment cladoceran and submerged macrophyte
   assemblages in the less enriched site, Selbrigg Pond, matched the
   palaeolimnological assemblages of the more enriched site, Felbrigg Hall
   Lake, in its more pristine state during the 1920s. Thus, Selbrigg was a
   temporal analogue for Felbrigg, from which the consequences of long-term
   eutrophication on food web structure could be inferred. These data
   represent the first steps towards reconstructing not only past
   assemblages (i.e. nodes within a food web), but also past interactions
   (i.e. links within a food web): a significant departure from much of the
   previous research in palaeolimnology.
   3. The more eutrophic food web had far fewer nodes and links, and thus a
   less reticulate network, than was the case for the more pristine system.
   In isotopic terms, there was vertical compression in delta 15N range
   (NR) and subsequent increased overlap in isotopic niche space,
   indicating increased trophic redundancy within Felbrigg. This structural
   change, which was associated with a greater channelling of energy
   through a smaller number of nodes as alternative feeding pathways
   disappear, could lead to reduced dynamic stability, pushing the network
   towards further simplification. These changes reflected a general shift
   from a benthic-dominated towards a more pelagic system, as the
   plant-associated subweb eroded.
   4. Although these data are among the first of their kind, the
   palaeo-analogue approach used here demonstrates the huge potential for
   applying food web theory to understand how and why these ecological
   networks change during eutrophication. Furthermore, because of the rich
   biological record preserved in their sediments, shallow lakes represent
   potentially important models for examining long-term intergenerational
   dynamics, thereby providing a means by which models and data can be
   integrated on meaningful timescales - a goal that has long proved
   elusive in food web ecology.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Woodward, G (Corresponding Author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol \& Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England.

   Boreal Shield Lakes: Insights from Stable Isotope Analyses",PLOS ONE,2014,9,4,NA,APR 24,"Perturbations on ecosystems can have profound immediate effects and can,
   accordingly, greatly alter the natural community. Land-use such as
   forestry activities in the Canadian Boreal region have increased in the
   last decades, raising concerns about their potential impact on aquatic
   ecosystems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of
   forest harvesting on trophic structure in eastern Canadian Boreal Shield
   lakes. We measured carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes values for
   aquatic primary producers, terrestrial detritus, benthic
   macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis)
   over a three-year period in eight eastern Boreal Shield lakes. Four
   lakes were studied before, one and two years after forest harvesting
   (perturbed lakes) and compared with four undisturbed reference lakes
   (unperturbed lakes) sampled at the same time. Stable isotope mixing
   models showed leaf-litter to be the main food source for benthic primary
   consumers in both perturbed and unperturbed lakes, suggesting no logging
   impact on allochthonous subsidies to the littoral food web. Brook trout
   derived their food mainly from benthic predatory macroinvertebrates in
   unperturbed lakes. However, in perturbed lakes one year after
   harvesting, zooplankton appeared to be the main contributor to brook
   trout diet. This change in brook trout diet was mitigated two years
   after harvesting. Size-related diet shift were also observed for brook
   trout, indicating a diet shift related to size. Our study suggests that
   carbon from terrestrial habitat may be a significant contribution to the
   food web of oligotrophic Canadian Boreal Shield lakes. Forest harvesting
   did not have an impact on the diet of benthic primary consumers. On the
   other hand, brook trout diet composition was affected by logging with
   greater zooplankton contribution in perturbed lakes, possibly induced by
   darker-colored environment in these lakes one year after logging.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Article,English,"Glaz, P (Corresponding Author), Univ Quebec, Dept Biol, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.

   spiders in the field",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE,2020,32,1,NA,JAN 6,"Background Examining the effects of pesticides is difficult in regions
   such as Western Europe because of the relatively ubiquitous use of
   agrochemicals and the lack of unaffected areas. To study a wide gradient
   of agrochemical stress, we conducted a study in Central Romania, where
   traditional agriculture, which is assumed to use less agrochemicals,
   exists adjacent to intensive agriculture. We investigated potential
   effects of land use related stressors including pesticides on
   aquatic-terrestrial predator-prey relationships using stable isotope
   analysis. Therefore, we sampled spiders, as well as their aquatic and
   terrestrial prey along streams with a pesticide pollution gradient and
   determined spider and prey stable carbon and nitrogen signals. Results
   Aquatic prey contributed 40.8-55.4\% to the diet of the orb web weaving
   spider Tetragnatha sp. and 34.0-53.0\% to the diet of the ground-hunting
   Pardosa sp. The biomass of potential aquatic prey increased along a
   gradient of increasing riparian habitat conditions and water quality and
   decreasing agriculture (e.g. arable land) in the catchment. The
   proportion of aquatic prey in the orb web weavers diet responded
   positively to the biomass of potential aquatic prey and negatively to
   this gradient. Increasing potential prey biomass resulted in an
   increasing proportion of aquatic prey for the orb web weaver. The
   proportion of aquatic prey in the ground hunters diet increased with
   in-stream pesticide toxicity and along a gradient of increasing
   pastoralism in the catchment as well as increasing riparian habitat and
   water quality. Conclusion The diet of two riparian predators responded
   to complex gradients of catchment land use, stream and riparian habitat
   quality as well as to in-stream pesticide toxicity. The responses to the
   different environmental variables can be attributed to direct (e.g.
   change in spider community) and indirect (e.g. changes in aquatic prey
   and terrestrial prey) effects. Future manipulative field studies or
   experiments on aquatic-terrestrial food webs are required to examine the
   causality of our findings and should also consider the quality of prey
   organisms to foster mechanistic understanding of cross-ecosystem
   effects.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Article,English,"Graf, N; Schäfer, RB (Corresponding Author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, iES Landau, Fortstr 7, D-76829 Landau, Germany.

   communities, altering their structure, diversity and functioning. These
   impacts are interrelated with changes in food web architecture. However,
   the reorganization or robustness of food webs in the face of invasion is
   a phenomenon poorly considered in ecology and conservation practices. In
   this article, we analyze the effects of the invasion of the American
   bullfrog, Lithobates catesbeianus, on the structure and function of
   invaded food webs. Specifically, we analyzed the integration of
   energetic channels by top predators, the relative use of alternative
   energetic paths by different functional groups and its dependence on
   body size among invaded and uninvaded communities in Uruguay, South
   America. The integration of energetic paths at high trophic positions by
   large body sized consumers was a pervasive feature of food webs among
   all studied ponds, in spite of turnover in top predator identity and
   large changes in community composition. Bullfrog post-metamorphs
   presented high trophic positions, integrating the primary producers and
   detritus paths, acting as apex predators in invaded food webs. The
   bullfrog tadpoles presented intermediate positions and were associated
   with the detritivorous pathway. On the other hand, the relative
   importance of the primary producers and detritus as carbon sources
   assimilated into the biomass of fish and invertebrates was altered in
   invaded systems. The robustness in the integration pattern of energy
   channels is congruent with its proposed central role in the stability of
   food webs. These results advance the understanding of the effect of
   invasions on key structural features of food webs, notably
   underrepresented in the invasion literature.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Gobel, N (Corresponding Author), Museo Nacl Hist Nat, Area Biodiversidad \& Conservac, Montevideo, Uruguay.

   Terrestrial Ecosystems",FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2021,9,NA,NA,DEC 2,"Cross-ecosystem subsidies are important as their recipients often rely
   on them to supplement in situ resource availability. Global warming has
   the potential to alter the quality and quantity of these subsidies, but
   our knowledge of these effects is currently limited. Here, we quantified
   the biomass and diversity of the invertebrates exchanged between
   freshwater streams and terrestrial grasslands in a natural warming
   experiment in Iceland. We sampled invertebrates emerging from the
   streams, those landing on the water surface, ground-dwelling
   invertebrates falling into the streams, and those drifting through the
   streams. Emerging invertebrate biomass or diversity did not change with
   increasing temperature, suggesting no effect of warming on aquatic
   subsidies to the terrestrial environment over the 1-month duration of
   the study. The biomass and diversity of aerial invertebrates of
   terrestrial origin landing on the streams increased with temperature,
   underpinned by increasing abundance and species richness, indicating
   that the greater productivity of the warmer streams may attract more
   foraging insects. The biomass of ground-dwelling invertebrates falling
   into the streams also increased with temperature, underpinned by
   increasing body mass and species evenness, suggesting that soil warming
   leads to terrestrial communities dominated by larger, more mobile
   organisms, and thus more in-fall to the streams. The biomass and
   diversity of terrestrial invertebrates in the drift decreased with
   temperature, however, underpinned by decreasing abundance and species
   richness, reflecting upstream consumption due to the higher energetic
   demands of aquatic consumers in warmer environments. These results
   highlight the potential for asynchronous responses to warming for
   reciprocal subsidies between aquatic and terrestrial environments and
   the importance of further research on warming impacts at the interface
   of these interdependent ecosystems.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"O'Gorman, EJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Essex, Sch Life Sci, Colchester, Essex, England.

   invasive species has proven problematic(3-6). Here we use stable isotope
   ratios to document the food-web consequences of the invasion of two
   non-native predators, smallmouth bass and rack bass, into Canadian
   lakes. Invaded lakes had lower littoral prey-fish diversity and
   abundance than uninvaded reference lakes. Consistent with this
   difference, lake trout from invaded lakes had more negative delta(13)C
   values (-29.2 parts per thousand versus -27.4 parts per thousand) and
   reduced trophic positions (3.3 versus 3.9) than those from reference
   lakes, indicating differences in food-web structure, Furthermore, a
   comparison of the pre- and post-invasion food webs of two recently
   invaded lakes showed that invasion was followed by substantial declines
   in littoral prey-fish abundance and the trophic position of lake trout,
   reflecting a shift in the diet of lake trout towards zooplankton and
   reduced dependence on littoral fish. This study demonstrates the use of

   stable isotopes",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,2018,25,24,23583-23594,AUG,"As part of the landscape, streams are influenced by land use. Here, we
   contributed to the understanding of the biological impacts of land use
   on streams, investigating how landscape effects vary with spatial scales
   (local vs. regional). We adopted a food web approach integrating both
   biological structure and functioning, to focus on the overall effect of
   land use on stream biocA{''}nosis. We selected 17 sites of a small
   tributary of the Seine River (France) for their contrasted land use, and
   conducted a natural experiment by sampling three organic matter sources,
   three macroinvertebrate taxa, and most of the fish community. Using
   stable isotope analysis, we calculated three food web metrics evaluating
   two major dimensions of the trophic diversity displayed by the fish
   community: (i) the diversity of exploited resources and (ii) the trophic
   level richness. The idea was to examine whether (1) land-use effects
   varied according to spatial scales, (2) land use affected food webs
   through an effect on community structure and (3) land use affected food
   webs through an effect on available resources. Beside an increase in
   trophic diversity from upstream to downstream, our empirical data showed
   that food webs were influenced by land use in the riparian corridors
   (local scale). The effect was complex, and depended on site's position
   along the upstream-downstream gradient. By contrast, land use in the
   catchment (regional scale) did not influence stream biocA{''}nosis. At
   the local scale, community structure was weakly influenced by land use,
   and thus played a minor role in explaining food web modifications. Our
   results suggested that the amount of available resources at the base of
   the food web was partly responsible for food web modifications. In
   addition, changes in biological functioning (i.e. feeding interactions)
   can also explain another part of the land-use effect. These results
   highlight the role played by the riparian corridors as a buffer zone,

   macroinvertebrates increased, while that of allochthonous resources,
   specifically leaf litter from the terrestrial ecosystems in the

   in the streams. The trophic diversity also increased with the elevated
   light intensity and nutrient availability, while the trophic redundancy
   decreased, suggesting a reduced ability of the stream ecosystems to
   resist environmental changes. Nutrient enrichment also increased the
   815N ratios of periphyton and macroinvertebrates, indicating potential
   815N enrichment of stream benthos by nitrogen pollution. Our results

   an invasive fish on terrestrial consumers",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2016,6,6,1745-1752,MAR,"Studies on resource sharing and partitioning generally consider species
   that occur in the same habitat. However, subsidies between linked
   habitats, such as streams and riparian zones, create potential for
   competition between populations which never directly interact. Evidence
   suggests that the abundance of riparian consumers declines after fish
   invasion and a subsequent increase in resource sharing of emerging
   insects. However, diet overlap has not been investigated. Here, we
   examine the trophic niche of native fish, invasive fish, and native
   spiders in South Africa using stable isotope analysis. We compared
   spider abundance and diet at upstream fishless and downstream fish sites
   and quantified niche overlap with invasive and native fish. Spider
   abundance was consistently higher at upstream fishless sites compared
   with paired downstream fish sites, suggesting that the fish reduced
   aquatic resource availability to riparian consumers. Spiders
   incorporated more aquatic than terrestrial insects in their diet, with
   aquatic insects accounting for 45-90\% of spider mass. In three of four
   invaded trout rivers, we found that the average proportion of aquatic
   resources in web-building spider diet was higher at fishless sites
   compared to fish sites. The probability of web-building and ground
   spiders overlapping into the trophic niche of invasive brown and rainbow
   trout was as high as 26 and 51\%, respectively. In contrast, the
   probability of spiders overlapping into the trophic niche of native fish
   was always less than 5\%. Our results suggest that spiders share
   resources with invasive fish. In contrast, spiders had a low probability
   of trophic overlap with native fish indicating that the traits of
   invaders may be important in determining their influence on ecosystem
   subsidies. We have added to the growing body of evidence that invaders
   can have cross-ecosystem impacts and demonstrated that this can be due
   to niche overlap.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Jackson, MC (Corresponding Author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Zool \& Entomol, Ctr Invas Biol, Private Bag X 20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa.

   along a landuse gradient",FRESHWATER SCIENCE,2016,35,3,882-894,SEP,"Freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems are connected via reciprocal
   cross-boundary resource fluxes, where terrestrially derived
   (allochthonous) organic matter is a critical energy source to freshwater
   food webs. Therefore, some proportion of aquatic-to-terrestrial resource
   fluxes, which consist primarily of emergent aquatic insects, are of
   allochthonous origin (i.e., recycled terrestrial matter). Landuse
   activities modify basal resources and consumer community composition in
   aquatic systems and, thereby, aquatic resource fluxes to terrestrial
   systems. The origin of aquatic terrestrial resource fluxes and
   alterations to them caused by land use should be considered to
   understand these fluxes better. Resource fluxes at the aquatic
   terrestrial interface were measured at 10 streams along a
   forest-to-agriculture gradient. Autochthony in emergent aquatic insects
   ranged from 10 to 97\%. Hence, aquatic fluxes to terrestrial systems
   drive the flux of matter of aquatic origin (true aquatic flux) and the
   recycling of terrestrial matter to the terrestrial environment. Land use
   indirectly affected autochthony of emergent aquatic insects via changes
   in water chemistry, high-quality resource availability, and in-stream
   consumer composition. Chironomidae diet shifts along the landuse
   gradient strengthened the aquatic flux to the land. For every 10\%
   increase in agricultural land cover, aquatically derived matter
   deposited on land via emergent Chironomidae increased 0.005 g dry mass
   m(-2) d(-1). Plecoptera strengthened the aquatic flux and the recycling
   of terrestrial matter via changes in abundance across the landuse
   gradient. Aquatically derived matter deposited on land via emergent
   Plecoptera increased 0.002 g dry mass m(-2) d(-1) for every 10\%
   increase in coniferous forest cover. Qualitative changes in resource
   fluxes across the aquatic terrestrial interface may be driven indirectly
   by the influences of land use on diets and composition of emergent
   aquatic insects.",UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",Article,English,"Jonsson, M (Corresponding Author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol \& Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.

   A stable isotope approach",ESTUARIES,2004,27,3,460-471,JUN,"Coastal ecosystems worldwide face increased nutrient enrichment from
   shoreline and watershed development and atmospheric pollution. We
   investigated the response of the faunal community of a small microtidal
   estuary dominated by Ruppia maritima (widgeon grass) in Maine, United
   States, to increased nitrogen loading using an in situ mesocosm
   enrichment experiment. Community response was characterized by assessing
   quantitative shifts in macroin-vertebrate community composition and
   identifying changes in food web structure using stable carbon and
   nitrogen isotope ratios of producers and consumers. The community was
   dominated by brackish water invertebrates including midge larvae,
   oligochaetes, damselfly larvae, amphipods, and ostracods. Experimental
   nutrient additions resulted in significantly lower densities of
   herbivorous chironomids and predatory damselflies and greater densities
   of deposit feeding oligochaetes. Grazing midge larvae (Chironomidae:
   Dicrotendipes, Cricotopus) consumed epiphytic algae under both natural
   and enriched conditions. Deposit feeding Chironomus was dependent on
   allochthonous sources of detritus under natural conditions and exhibited
   a shift to autochthonous sources of detritus under enriched conditions.
   Predatory Enallagma primarily consumed grazing chironomids under all but

   MEXICO'S CENTRAL PLATEAU",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,2009,25,9,1090-1108,NOV,"Habitat modifications, non-native species and other anthropogenic
   impacts have restructured fish communities in lotic ecosystems of
   central Mexico. Conservation of native fishes requires understanding of
   food web changes resulting from the introduction of non-native species,
   flow alteration and other human impacts. Using delta(13)C and delta(15)N
   analysis of fishes and invertebrates we investigated the effects of
   non-native species, and reservoirs on food webs of the Laja river
   ecosystem (Guanajuato, central Mexico). We estimated trophic position
   (TP), relative trophic niche and food web dispersion at 11 reservoir,
   river and tailwater sites. Reservoirs and non-native fishes modified
   food webs in the Laja. Food web dispersion was greater in reservoir than
   in tailwater and river sites. Reservoir food webs had the greatest range
   of delta(13)C values, indicating a more diverse resource base compared
   to rivers. delta(13)C values increased with distance downstream from
   reservoirs, suggesting declining subsidies of river food webs by
   reservoir productivity. Stable isotopes revealed potential effects of
   non-native fishes on native fishes via predation or competition.
   Non-native Micropterus salmoides were top predators in the system.
   Non-natives Cyprinus carpio, Oreochromis mossambicus and Carassius
   auratus exhibited lowest TP in the Laja but overlapped significantly
   with most native species, indicating potential for resource competition.
   Native Chirostoma jordani was the only species with a significantly
   different trophic niche from all other fish. Many rivers in central
   Mexico share similar anthropogenic impacts and similar biotas, such that
   food web patterns described here are likely indicative of other river

   analysis and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models to investigate
   spatial and interannual variation in the dominant production pathways
   supporting fish consumers within the central basin of Lake Erie. We

   americana; rainbow smelt, Osmerus mordax; and round goby, Neogobius
   melanostomus) using tissue samples collected in 2017 and 2019. delta 13C
   values varied by location consistent with expected baseline differences
   in nutrient loading (13C was more enriched in the southern region) in
   two of six ANCOVA models. Furthermore, delta 15N values varied with
   individual fish size and by location in a manner consistent with spatial
   patterns of nutrient loading from surrounding agricultural landscapes
   (15N was more enriched in the northern region) and a longitudinal
   gradient of eutrophication, decreasing from west to east. These patterns
   were not exhibited by all species and did not necessarily persist across
   years, suggesting that additional factors (e.g., regional diet
   differences, river plume dynamics) also contributed to observed delta
   13C and delta 15N variation. We suggest that spatiotemporal variation of

   stable isotope approach",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,2022,834,NA,NA,AUG 15,"Climate change and associated droughts threaten the ecology and
   resilience of natural saline lakes globally. There is a distinct lack of
   research regarding their ecological response to climatic events in the
   Global South. This region is predicted to experience climatic events
   such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) more often and with greater
   severity with the potential to alter the structure and functioning of
   aquatic ecosystems significantly. From 2015 to 2016 South Africa
   experienced one of the most severe country-wide droughts as a result of
   a strong ENSO event. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of this
   supra-seasonal drought on the trophic structure of fish communities in a
   naturally saline shallow lake of a Ramsar wetland using stable isotope
   techniques. Fishes and potential basal sources were collected from the
   lake, during predrought conditions in 2010 and after severe drought
   (recovery phase; 2017). The delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of food web
   elements were determined and analysed using Bayesian mixing models and
   Bayesian Laymen metrics to establish the proportional contribution of
   C-3 and C-4 basal sources to the fish (consumer) diets, and examine the
   fish community in terms of isotopic niche and trophic structure,
   respectively. Fish consumers relied predominantly on C-3 basal sources
   in the predrought and shifted to greater reliance on C-4 basal sources,
   decreased isotopic niche space use and a reduction in trophic length in
   the recovery phase. Drought altered the type and abundance of the basal
   sources available by limiting sources to those that are more
   drought-tolerant, reducing the trophic pathways of the food web with no
   significant alterations in the fish community. These results demonstrate
   the resilience and biological plasticity of Lake Nyamithi and its
   aquatic fauna, highlighting the importance of freshwater inflow to
   saline lakes with alterations thereof posing a significant threat to
   their continued functioning.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"de Necker, L (Corresponding Author), North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci \& Management, Water Res Grp, Private Bag X6001, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa.

   webs and movement of invertebrates in farmland. However, stable isotope
   values of farmland invertebrates have been reported for only a few crop
   types, and rarely for other land uses within farmland. We compared delta
   C-13 and delta N-15 of invertebrates captured in corn, soybean, hay, and
   hedgerows in eastern Ontario, Canada. delta C-13 was significantly lower
   in invertebrates captured in hay and hedgerows than in invertebrates
   captured in soybean and corn, but was not different between
   invertebrates captured in corn and soybean. This suggests invertebrates
   may be moving between crop fields during the growing season, using
   alternative food sources within crop fields, or retaining delta C-13
   values from the previous year. When all invertebrates were examined
   together, delta N-15 was significantly higher in invertebrates captured
   in manured corn than in those captured in soybeans, hedgerows, or
   manured or unmanured hay, but there was no difference between
   invertebrates captured in manured or unmanured corn. However, spiders
   from manured corn had significantly higher delta N-15 than those from
   unmanured corn. Spiders had less variable delta N-15 than other taxa in
   this study, because they occupy a single trophic level. This may make
   spiders more suitable for detecting changes in fertilization regimes. By
   demonstrating how invertebrate delta C-13 and delta N-15 vary with land

   provide key insights into trophic structure and sources of nutrients.
   Trophic relationships are influenced by primary productivity
   (bottom-up), harvest and predation (top-down), and other factors such as
   invasive species. Increased nutrient loading to Lake Winnipeg has led to
   signs of eutrophication, while introduced rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax)
   now comprise a significant proportion of the diet of some commercial
   fish species. Our objective was to establish current delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 isotopic baselines for fishes in Lake Winnipeg in order to
   describe fish community structure and identify dietary nutrient sources.
   The North Basin food web was depleted in N-15 and enriched in C-13 over
   the South Basin. Smelt did not differ isotopically from other forage
   fish, while smelt-consuming walleye in the North Basin were more
   enriched in N-15 over South Basin walleye. This suggests that either
   smelt differ nutritionally from native forage species resulting in a
   higher diet-walleye delta N-15 discrimination factor, or that South
   Basin walleye feed more on zooplankton. Strong correlations between fish
   tissue isotope values and those of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta
   C-13-DIC) and nitrate (delta N-15-NO3) revealed that inorganic spatial
   patterns in each basin label the base of the food web isotopically.
   Stable isotope measurements of fish will be useful in assessing
   long-term changes due to eutrophication and invasive species in Lake
   Winnipeg, as well as providing a benchmark to assess remediation
   efficacy. Crown Copyright (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf

   threatening biodiversity and ecosystem services worldwide. However, few
   studies have strictly analyzed the effect of the functional responses of
   tropical streams to changes in forest cover since deforested basins are
   usually also influenced by confounding anthropogenic inputs. Here we
   address tropical streams and test whether the stable isotopic ratios of
   nitrogen (N, delta N-15) and carbon (C, delta C-13) and the ratio of C:N
   of ecosystem components vary along a forest cover gradient. We also
   assess the ecological integrity of streams by in situ measurements using
   physical features commonly used in stream quality assessments. The
   results showed that the delta N-15 of most aquatic components, delta
   C-13 of particulate matter and omnivorous fish, and C:N of particulate
   matter and algae vary significantly with forest cover, indicating the
   role of terrestrial vegetation in regulating stream biogeochemistry. The
   dual stable isotope analysis satisfactorily indicated the changes in
   terrestrial-aquatic connections regarding both N and C cycles, thus
   showing the role of algae and particulate matter in influencing stream
   fauna through food web transfers. Our results support the use of stable
   isotopes to monitor watershed deforestation and highlight the need for

   rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) in a subtropical river
   system, upper Blyde River, South Africa",FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,2022,10,NA,NA,SEP 27,"The introduction of alien predatory fish such as rainbow trout
   (Oncorhynchus mykiss) can have a significant effect on indigenous fish
   communities such as altering the structure and dynamics of food webs.
   Quantifying the trophic niche utilised by the alien fish species is
   therefore important to aid our understanding of how their feeding
   strategies might aid establishment, define their functional role and
   inform on potential impacts. This study assessed food web interactions
   between fish communities in river reaches that are invaded by O. mykiss
   and sections that are free of invasions in the upper Blyde River
   catchment, South Africa. It specifically evaluated the hypothesis that
   O. mykiss invasion is likely to lead to a decrease in the trophic
   functional diversity through predation and that indigenous fish will
   shift their trophic niche to either minimise competition with, or avoid
   predation, by O. mykiss. Gut content and stable isotope analyses were
   used to determine trophic interactions. Fish communities in uninvaded
   areas utilised fewer and similar food sources and occupied lower trophic
   levels, than fish communities in invaded areas. Oncorhynchus mykiss fed
   mainly on invertebrates and at trophic levels similar to and or lower
   than indigenous fishes. This suggests that their current impact on
   indigenous fish communities is mainly through competition for resources.
   We posit that O. mykiss invasions reduced the abundance of indigenous
   fishes and thereby reduced predation pressure on aquatic invertebrates,
   with a knock-on effect on the trophic interrelationships among fish
   assemblages. Our findings are consistent with other studies in South
   Africa that have shown that the impacts of O. mykiss invasion can lead
   to a decline and fragmentation of indigenous species populations and

   understand food webs and explore trophic interactions in ecosystems.
   Traditionally, delta C-13 vs. delta N-15 bi-plots have been used to
   describe food web structure for a single time period or ecosystem.
   Comparisons of food webs across time and space are increasing, but
   development of statistical approaches for testing hypotheses regarding
   food web change has lagged behind. Here we present statistical
   methodologies for quantitatively comparing stable isotope food web data.
   We demonstrate the utility of circular statistics and hypothesis tests
   for quantifying directional food web differences using two case studies:
   an arthropod salt marsh community across a habitat gradient and a
   freshwater fish community from Lake Tahoe, USA, over a 120-year time
   period. We calculated magnitude and mean angle of change (h) for each
   species in food web space using mean delta C-13 and delta N-15 of each
   species as the x, y coordinates. In the coastal salt marsh, arthropod
   consumers exhibited a significant shift toward dependence on Spartina,
   progressing from a habitat invaded by Phragmites to a restored Spartina
   habitat. In Lake Tahoe, we found that all species from the freshwater
   fish community shifted in the same direction in food web space toward
   more pelagic-based production with the introduction of nonnative Mysis
   relicta and onset of cultural eutrophication. Using circular statistics
   to quantitatively analyze stable isotope food web data, we were able to
   gain signifi. cant insight into patterns and changes in food web
   structure that were not evident from qualitative comparisons. As more
   ecologists incorporate a food web perspective into ecosystem analysis,
   these statistical tools can provide a basis for quantifying directional

   Larks (<i>Eremophila alpestris</i>) of the Colorado Desert",JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY,2021,162,2,381-393,APR,"Agriculture can dramatically alter community composition, food webs, and
   resource availability, yet the impacts of agriculture on many ecosystems
   and their constituents remain unstudied. Here, we examined the effect of
   agriculture on the isotopic ecology of Horned Larks (Eremophila
   alpestris) in the Colorado Desert. Over the last century, the Imperial
   Valley in southeastern California has transformed from desert scrub into
   agricultural land, while breeding Horned Larks have persisted in the
   area. We compared the isotopic composition of nitrogen (delta N-15),
   carbon (delta C-13), and hydrogen (delta H-2) from feathers of lark
   specimens from two time periods in the Imperial Valley: a historical
   series collected between 1916 and 1923 and more recent vouchers
   collected between 1984 and 2014. We also quantified delta N-15 and delta
   C-13 values from plants and soil samples in contemporary agricultural
   land and adjacent desert scrub to estimate isotopic baseline changes
   associated with agricultural intensification. Contemporary larks had
   lower delta N-15 and delta C-13 ratios compared to historical larks,
   while plant and soil delta N-15 ratios were higher at agricultural sites
   compared to adjacent desert sites. These opposing trends suggest
   temporal change in isotope values that cannot be explained by shifting
   baselines alone. Furthermore, isotopic niche breadth (parts per
   thousand(2); delta N-15 and delta C-13) was lower among contemporary
   larks. Thus, contemporary larks in the Imperial Valley may capitalize on
   seeds and phytophagous insects that are abundant among crops, possibly
   representing an opportunistic change in diet over time in response to
   agriculture. Finally, delta H-2 values did not differ between historical
   and contemporary larks, but contemporary larks had delta H-2 values that
   differed from historical ground water, suggesting intake of water
   introduced by irrigational canals. Collectively, these findings
   highlight the power of stable isotope analyses combined with natural
   history collections to examine ecological change in the Anthropocene.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",Article,English,"Mason, NA (Corresponding Author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol \& Evolutionary Biol, Corson Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.

   and below ground animal communities by altering their trophic niches.
   However, shifts in trophic niches with changes in land use are little
   studied and this applies in particular to belowground animals. Oribatid
   mites are among the most abundant soil animals, involved in
   decomposition processes and nutrient cycling. We analyzed shifts in
   trophic niches of six soil-living oribatid mite species with the
   conversion of lowland secondary rainforest into plantation systems of
   different land-use intensity (jungle rubber, rubber and oil palm
   monoculture plantation) in two regions of southwest Sumatra, Indonesia.
   We measured stable isotope ratios (C-13/C-12 and N-15/N-14) of single
   oribatid mite individuals and calculated shifts in stable isotope niches
   with changes in land use. Significant changes in stable isotope ratios
   in three of the six studied oribatid mite species indicated that these
   species shift their trophic niches with changes in land use. The trophic
   shift was either due to changes in trophic level (delta N-15 values), to
   changes in the use of basal resources (delta C-13 values) or to changes
   in both. The trophic shift generally was most pronounced between more
   natural systems (rainforest and jungle rubber) on one side and
   monoculture plantations systems (rubber and oil palm plantations) on the
   other, reflecting that the shifts were related to land-use intensity.
   Although trophic niches of the other three studied species did not
   differ significantly between land-use systems they followed a similar
   trend. Overall, the results suggest that colonization of very different
   ecosystems such as rainforest and intensively managed monoculture
   plantations by oribatid mite species likely is related to their ability
   to shift their trophic niches, i.e. to trophic plasticity.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Article,English,"Krause, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool \& Anthropol, Gottingen, Germany.

   biological communities and their trophic interactions in riverine
   ecosystems. However, how land use and the seasonality of environmental
   conditions jointly influence the food web structure of riverine
   ecosystems remains unclear. Here, we conducted a comparative study on
   basal resources, macroinvertebrates, and fish at woodland and urban
   sites to explore the combined effects of land use and environmental
   conditions during spring, autumn, and winter on the food web structure
   of a subtropical river in China. We used delta C-13 and delta N-15 to
   trace consumers' diets and calculate community-level metrics within food
   webs. At woodland sites, we found that allochthonous sources contributed
   significantly more to consumers' diets in the high flow season (53\%)
   than in the low flow season (around 30\%), but allochthonous sources
   contributed less than 30\% at urban sites. The seasonal flooding
   facilitated the acquisition of terrestrial sources at woodland sites,
   while the impervious surface cover at urban sites cut off the influx of
   terrestrial inputs. The isotopic niche space of basal resources at both
   woodland and urban sites was significantly higher in the high flow
   season. However, the isotopic niche space of consumers at urban sites
   was not significantly different between seasons. Trophic length, niche
   width, and trophic redundancy showed no seasonal differences at urban
   sites, but trophic length increased significantly during the high flow

   generated enormous pressure on local marine biodiversity and ecosystems.
   This study aimed to assess the distribution and shifts of hotspot
   fitness zones for S. ocellatus under global climate change and to
   identify the trophic levels in the coastal waters of China. The species
   distribution model (SDM) identified four hotspot fitness zones at a
   global scale located in the Atlantic Ocean along the Gulf of Mexico and
   Uruguayan coasts, and in the Pacific Ocean along the Chinese and
   Australian coasts. Under global warming and climate change, the most
   suitable habitat for S. ocellatus would expand (448,178.6 km(2)) and the
   centre of mass would shift northwards. Stable isotope delta N-15 and
   delta C-13 ratios indicated S. ocellatus has very high ecological

   (Carabidae) at a river-land interface",ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,2017,32,1,27-35,JAN,"A variety of organisms mediate river-terrestrial linkages through
   spatial subsidies. However, most empirical studies have classified
   organisms rather broadly (e.g., by functional group or taxonomic family)
   and have dismissed species-level linkages at the interface of
   ecosystems. Here, we show how allochthonous resource use varies among
   taxonomically similar species of ground beetles (family Carabidae)
   across seasons (June-September). We investigated seasonal shifts in the
   distribution of five beetle species and their dietary responses to
   spatial subsidies (emerging aquatic insects) in a Japanese braided
   river. Despite their taxonomic closeness, the ground beetles showed
   species-specific responses to spatial subsidies, and beetle distribution
   patterns tended to coincide with their diets. Overall, 1-56\% of ground
   beetle diets were derived from aquatic prey. One genus (Bembidion spp.)
   mainly consumed aquatic prey, while three species fed primarily on
   terrestrial prey across all seasons. However, one species
   (Lithochlaenius noguchii) showed shifts in its diet from aquatic to
   terrestrial prey according to subsidy availability. The observed
   variation in allochthonous resource use was likely related to
   species-specific foraging modes, physiological tolerance to dry
   conditions, and interspecific competition. Our findings suggest that
   considering species-specific interactions is necessary to fully
   understand cross-system interactions and recipient food-web dynamics.",SPRINGER JAPAN KK,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065,

   Age and Roman Britain",ENVIRONMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY,2021,26,1,13-28,JAN 2,"Following the Roman conquest, agricultural production in Britain faced
   increasing demand from large urban and military populations. While it
   has long been thought that this necessitated an increase in agricultural
   production, direct archaeological evidence for changes in cultivation
   practices has been scarce. Using a model that conceptualises cereal
   farming strategies in terms of intensive or extensive practices, this
   paper is the first study to address this question using carbon and
   nitrogen stable isotope data of crop remains. We report delta N-15 and
   delta C-13 values from 41 samples of spelt, emmer and barley from Bronze
   Age, Iron Age and Roman Stanwick (Northants., UK), in order to assess
   the intensiveness of arable farming and investigate shifts in
   cultivation practices in prehistoric and Roman Britain. The results
   demonstrate a decline in delta N-15 in the Roman period, suggesting that
   farming practices moved to lower levels of manuring and, by implication,
   became more extensive. delta C-13 values are comparable in all periods,
   supporting the suggestion that changes observed in human stable isotope
   data between the Iron Age and Roman period are best explained by dietary
   change rather than a shift towards higher delta C-13 values in plants at
   the base of the food chain.","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Lodwick, L (Corresponding Author), Univ Oxford, All Souls Coll, Oxford OX1 4AL, England.

   omnivory and more trophic levels",OIKOS,2014,123,10,1157-1172,OCT,"Food web topologies depict the community structure as distributions of
   feeding interactions across populations. Although the soil ecosystem
   provides important functions for aboveground ecosystems, data on complex
   soil food webs is notoriously scarce, most likely due to the difficulty
   of sampling and characterizing the system. To fill this gap we assembled
   the complex food webs of 48 forest soil communities. The food webs
   comprise 89 to 168 taxa and 729 to 3344 feeding interactions. The
   feeding links were established by combining several molecular methods
   (stable isotope, fatty acid and molecular gut content analyses) with
   feeding trials and literature data. First, we addressed whether soil
   food webs (n = 48) differ significantly from those of other ecosystem
   types (aquatic and terrestrial aboveground, n = 77) by comparing 22 food
   web parameters. We found that our soil food webs are characterized by
   many omnivorous and cannibalistic species, more trophic chains and
   intraguild-predation motifs than other food webs and high average and
   maximum trophic levels. Despite this, we also found that soil food webs
   have a similar connectance as other ecosystems, but interestingly a
   higher link density and clustering coefficient. These differences in
   network structure to other ecosystem types may be a result of ecosystem
   specific constraints on hunting and feeding characteristics of the
   species that emerge as network parameters at the food-web level. In a
   second analysis of land-use effects, we found significant but only small
   differences of soil food web structure between different beech and
   coniferous forest types, which may be explained by generally strong
   selection effects of the soil that are independent of human land use.
   Overall, our study has unravelled some systematic structures of soil
   food-webs, which extends our mechanistic understanding how environmental
   characteristics of the soil ecosystem determine patterns at the

   analysis",AQUATIC INVASIONS,2019,14,2,280-298,JUN,"Invasive species can directly or indirectly alter (a)biotic
   characteristics of ecosystems, resulting in changing energy flows
   through the food web. This can potentially affect bottom-up or top-down
   control on resident species. The food web structure in the Biesbosch
   reservoirs (The Netherlands) was examined after recent invasions of the
   quagga mussel ( Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) and round goby
   (Neogobius melanostomus), by means of stable isotope analysis. Quagga
   mussels reached relatively high densities after invasion, replacing the
   zebra mussel (D. polymorpha). The delta C-13 signatures in the food web
   showed two distinct basic signatures of primary producers: 1)
   phytoplankton and Elodea nuttallii, and 2) more enriched submerged
   macrophytes (i.e. Potamogeton sp.). Quagga mussel was found to rely on
   zooplankton and phytoplankton. Mussel detritus seemed to be of
   importance for the gammarid Dikerogammarus spp. (both D. villosus and D.
   haemobaphes). delta N-15 as a proxy for trophic level revealed that the
   largest specimens of ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), pike-perch (Sander
   lucioperca) and perch (Perca fluviatilis) formed the top of the food
   chain. A stable isotope mixing model estimated that 43\% of round goby
   diet consisted of Dikerogammarus spp. and approximately 27\% of quagga
   mussels. Ruffe diet consisted of 29\% of quagga mussels and only 12\% of
   Dikerogammarus sp. Quagga mussels were less important as a food source
   for round goby than often has been described. Besides being a food
   source, mussel beds also provide a suitable habitat for
   macroinvertebrates (i.e. Dikerogammarus spp.). The invasive round goby
   and native ruffe seemed to compete for food in the benthic zone, where
   round goby possibly forced ruffe to use less nutritive or favourable
   food sources. Likely, this has contributed to the decline in ruffe

   relationships, describing foodweb changes, and assessing ecosystem
   health. Clear interpretation of stable isotopes is facilitated by
   understanding how environmental factors can affect isotopic values; in
   estuarine systems, these factors may include salinity, land use, and
   shoreline habitat. To evaluate these factors, fish were collected from
   shallow-water habitats next to hardened (bulkhead and riprap) and
   unhardened (beach and marsh) shorelines within five subestuaries of the
   Chesapeake Bay that differed in predominant land use and salinity. This
   study focused on three common mid-Atlantic fish species: mummichog,
   Fundulus heteroclitus, Atlantic silverside, Menidia menidia, and white
   perch, Morone americana. Multiple regression analyses pointed to
   standard length, salinity, of watershed as developed or crop land, and
   shoreline habitat type as important predictors for N-15 in all three
   species and for C-13 in mummichog and white perch. Further analysis
   controlling for the effects of salinity, land use, and fish size
   demonstrated that C-13 and N-15 were lower in tissues of fish collected
   next to marsh compared with hardened or beach habitat. Habitat effects
   were strongest for mummichog. This study focused on overarching patterns
   driving stable isotope signatures in fish; however, it also indicated
   potentially important interactions between nearshore habitat type and
   land use or salinity that deserve further analysis. Results have
   implications for the scale of isotope inquiry and give justification for
   more detailed follow-up studies of foodweb structure along modified and

   that is altering interspecific interactions at low-and mid-trophic
   levels. However, little attention has been focused on the effects of
   redistributions of species on the trophic ecology of a high
   trophic-level predator assemblage. Here, during a 22-year period
   (1990-2012) of increasing sea temperature (1.0 degrees C) and decreasing
   sea ice extent (12\%) in Cumberland Sound, Nunavut, Canada, we examined
   the trophic structure of a near-apex predator assemblage before
   (1990-2002) and after (2005-2012) an increase in the availability of
   capelin-generally an indicator species in colder marine environments for
   a warming climate. Stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were used
   in a Bayesian framework to assess shifts in diet, niche size and
   community-wide metrics for beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), ringed
   seals (Ansa hispida), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides)
   and anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus). After 2005, consumption
   of forage fish increased for all predator species, suggesting diet
   flexibility with changing abiotic and biotic conditions. An associated
   temporal shift from a trophically diverse to a trophically redundant
   predator assemblage occurred where predators now play similar trophic
   roles by consuming prey primarily from the pelagic energy pathway.
   Overall, these long-term ecological changes signify that trophic shifts
   of a high trophic-level predator assemblage associated with climate
   change have occurred in the Arctic food web.",ROYAL SOC,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Yurkowski, DJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.

   change worldwide. It has therefore become essential to describe
   ecosystem statuses with respect to multinational protection schemes,
   often necessitating long-term monitoring programmes. Changes in the
   food-web structure, which can be monitored via stable isotope
   measurements, represent an important descriptor of the status of marine
   ecosystems. We investigated long-term changes (29 years) in isotopic
   values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in four indicative organisms at
   different trophic levels in the southern North and Baltic Seas:
   bladderwrack (Fucus vesiculosus), blue mussel (Mytilus ssp.), eelpout
   (Zoarces viviparus), and herring gull (Larus argentatus). Time series
   analyses using generalised additive models revealed largely consistent
   declines in delta C-13 and delta N-15 throughout all trophic levels of
   the coastal food web at all study sites, indicating a clear change in
   these coastal regions from 1988 to 2016. There were no clear long-term
   patterns in egg biometrics for herring gulls, except for a consistent
   increase in eggshell thickness. The declines in stable isotope values
   were in line with the results of previous long-term studies of single
   higher-trophic-level species, which suggested that the noted changes
   were mainly caused by altered foraging patterns of the studied species.
   The current results demonstrate that declines in delta C-13 and delta
   N-15 have occurred throughout the whole food web, not just in particular
   species. We discuss the possible reasons for the decrease in stable
   isotope values, including decreasing eutrophication and an increase in
   terrestrial carbon sources.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Schwemmer, P (Corresponding Author), Univ Kiel, Res \& Technol Ctr FTZ, Hafentorn 1, D-25761 Busum, Germany.

Schaefer,Do agricultural pesticides in streams influence riparian spiders?,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,2019,660,NA,126-135,APR 10,"Freshwater ecosystems are coupledwith their riparian area. Emerging
   insects are prey for predators in the riparian zone, enriching the
   terrestrial ecosystemwith energy and nutrients. Stressors associated
   with agriculture can alter insect communities in water and on land,
   resulting in complex response patterns of terrestrial predators relying
   on prey fromboth systems. Examining the effects from individual
   agricultural stressors such as pesticides is hampered in landscapes with
   intensive agriculture where multiple stressors like habitat degradation
   and typically co-occur. In rural regions of Eastern Europe, traditional
   low intensity agriculture based on working animals and human labour
   prevails alongside intensive, mechanised agriculture. Assuming that
   low-intensity agriculture relies on no or limited pesticide use, whereas
   fertilizer use is similar across different agricultural intensities,
   such regionsmay allowto study in-streampesticide effects independent
   fromother stressors, such as nutrient input or habitat degradation. We
   examined the taxonomic and trait response of riparian spider communities
   to gradients of agricultural stressors and environmental variables in
   the region around Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Pesticide sampling was done
   using passive samplers in the streams adjacent to spider sampling sites.
   To capture spiders with different traits and survival strategies, we
   used multiple collection methods. Community composition was best
   explained by in-stream pesticide toxicity and shading of the stream
   bank, a proxy for the quality of the habitat. Species richness and the
   number of spider individuals were negatively associated with in-stream
   pesticide toxicity. In contrast, mean body size and shading preference
   of spider communities responded strongest to shading, whereas mean niche
   width (habitat preference for moisture and shading) responded strongest
   to the other environmental variables. Our study suggests that in-stream
   pesticide toxicity can influence riparian communities. The
   identification of mechanisms requires further studies targeting the
   potential contributions of direct toxicity and indirect effects from
   reduced aquatic and terrestrial prey availability. (c) 2019 Elsevier

   knowledge on its effect upon estuarine food webs dynamics is still
   scarce. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were used to assess the
   effect of river flow in the connectivity and food web interactions
   between the two main fish nursery areas of the Tagus estuary. The aims
   of the present work were to investigate the seasonal variation in food
   web structure and the exchange rate of individuals of marine juvenile
   fish among estuarine nurseries, to compare the spring of a rainy year
   (2001) with that of an average year (2000), and to investigate the
   impact of the winter floods of 2001. A low level of connectivity was
   observed for the fish species that use these areas as nurseries. In low
   river flow conditions, two isotopically distinct food webs were
   established in each nursery area. These food webs were very sensitive to
   small variations in the freshwater input. Winter floods seem to disrupt
   the localized food webs that are established in low river flow periods,
   leading to the re-establishment of a wider food web. While in rainy
   years this wide food web is maintained until spring, in average years
   the food web undergoes fragmentation into two localized and isotopically
   distinctive food webs. The increase in frequency of droughts due to
   climate change should lower the connectivity of the estuarine fish
   nurseries food webs, causing habitat fragmentation and consequent loss

   sparse, and the geographical scale is immense. We developed

   Ourmillennial-scale isotope records of amino acids in bone collagen in a

   interpretation based on bulk and amino acid specific d15N chronologies
   for Hawaiian deep-sea corals and bulk d15N chronologies for the Hawaiian

   ecosystems, with important consequences for biodiversity. How these
   disturbances drive changes in the trophic structure of native food webs
   through time is poorly understood. Here, we quantify trophic disruption
   in freshwater food webs to invasion by an apex fish predator, lake
   trout, using an extensive stable isotope dataset across a natural
   gradient of uninvaded and invaded lakes in the northern Rocky Mountains,
   USA. Lake trout invasion increased fish diet variability (trophic
   dispersion), displaced native fishes from their reference diets (trophic
   displacement), and reorganized macroinvertebrate communities, indicating
   strong food web disruption. Trophic dispersion was greatest 25 to 50 y
   after colonization and dissipated as food webs stabilized in later
   stages of invasion (>50 y). For the native apex predator, bull trout,
   trophic dispersion preceded trophic displacement, leading to their
   functional loss in late-invasion food webs. Our results demonstrate how
   invasive species progressively disrupt native food webs via trophic
   dispersion and displacement, ultimately yielding biological communities

   logged and converted to oil palm monocultures. Although the impacts of
   these changes on biodiversity are largely well documented, we know
   addition to samples we collected in 201 little about how these
   large-scale impacts affect freshwater trophic ecology. We used stable
   isotope analyses (SIA) to determine the impacts of land-use changes on
   the relative contribution of allochthonous and autochthonous basal
   resources in 19 stream food webs. We also applied compound-specific SIA
   and bulk-SIA to determine the trophic position of fish apex predators
   and meso-predators (invertivores and omnivores). There was no difference
   in the contribution of autochthonous resources in either consumer group
   (70-82\%) among streams with different land-use type. There was no
   change in trophic position for meso-predators, but trophic position
   decreased significantly for apex predators in oil palm plantation
   streams compared to forest streams. This change in maximum food chain
   length was due to turnover in identity of the apex predator among
   land-use types. Disruption of aquatic trophic ecology, through reduction
   in food chain length and shift in basal resources, may cause significant
   changes in biodiversity as well as ecosystem functions and services.

   Seasonal events such as leaf fall and algal blooms can influence

   This study examined such patterns in two contrasting streams in Sweden:
   Vadsbacken, which is heavily impacted by agriculture and has high
   nitrogen levels, and Pinnarpsbacken, which has a primarily forested
   catchment and lower nitrogen levels. Different organic compartments
   (e.g., detritus, biofilm, and invertebrates) were sampled in September,
   November, April, and June. Effects of sampling date on isotope
   signatures of leaf litter (delta N-15: p = 0.0001, delta C-13: p =

   0.05) and invertebrates (delta N-15: p = 0.04) were found. However,
   there were site-specific temporal patterns in isotope signatures,
   probably reflecting disparate origins of allochthonous material related
   to the differences in catchment land use. Mixing models revealed no
   changes in resource partitioning that could be attributed to the
   above-mentioned seasonal events. The site-specific patterns recorded

   heterogeneity at small spatial scale in intertidal sediment.
   Macrobenthic community diversity was compared between these two
   disturbances and their respective control points throughout the year
   2007 at the Roscoff Aber Bay (Western English Channel, France). In March
   and September 2007, trophic community pathways of characteristic species
   were additionally studied using stable isotope ratios of carbon and
   nitrogen. The low salinity recorded at the freshwater seepage induced
   the exclusion of the main bioturbator and the presence of omnivores
   which modified the community composition by biotic pressure. Moreover,
   food web analyses clearly highlighted a separation at small spatial
   scale between the two trophic pathways of the impacted area and its
   control. On the contrary, little differences were observed owning to the
   ephemeral Enteromorpha spp. proliferation. This suggested a progressive
   and diffusive disturbance which was applied from the algal mat to the
   nearby area. However, seasonal changes were observed. First, the algal
   expansion phase increased the macrofauna diversity and foraminifers'
   abundance (meiofauna) and then acted as a physical barrier decreasing
   sediment and water column exchanges and decreasing the fauna diversity.
   This study highlights the need to take into account small spatial
   heterogeneity to avoid misinterpretations in intertidal ecology studies.

   compared to bivalves collected from a less nutrient sensitive estuary

   ten coastal wetlands on Lake Superior, using published stable isotope
   food web data for three wetlands and original data from seven additional
   systems in order to span regional hydrologic and nutrient enrichment
   gradients. We used a dual-source isotope mixing model to estimate the
   proportion of carbon in fish that originated from planktonic versus
   periphytic invertebrates, and we related carbon source to 1) nutrient
   enrichment, 2) hydraulic residence time, and 3) an index of nutrient
   loading that incorporates residence time and nutrient concentrations.
   There was no relationship between nutrient enrichment and the proportion
   of planktonic versus periphytic C in fish. Proportion of planktonic C in
   fish increased significantly with hydraulic residence time (F = 5.68,
   R-2 = 0.42, p = 0.044). Riverine wetlands generally had lowest
   proportions of planktonic C in fish, dendritic wetlands were
   intermediate, and lagoon wetlands had highest proportions. A regression
   between the loading index and planktonic C in fish was an improvement
   over the residence time regression (F = 11.7, R-2 = 0.59, p = 0.009). We
   conclude that coastal wetland food webs are strongly affected by
   hydrology and further by nutrient enrichment. This work has implications

Article,Heloise Gibb and Saul A. Cunningham,"Habitat contrasts reveal a shift in the trophic position of ant
   assemblages",JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,2011,80,1,119-127,JAN,"P>1. Trophic structure within a guild can be influenced by factors such
   as resource availability and competition. While ants occupy a wide range
   of positions in food webs, and ant community composition changes with
   habitat, it is not well understood if ant genera tend to maintain their
   position in the trophic structure, or if trophic position varies across
   habitats.
   2. We used ratios of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to test for
   differences in the trophic structure and position of assemblages of ants
   among habitat types. We tested for differences between assemblages in
   replicate sites of the land use categories: (i) pastures with old large
   trees; (ii) recently revegetated pastures with small young trees; and
   (iii) remnant woodlands. Known insect herbivores and predatory spiders
   provided baselines for herbivorous and predaceous arthropods. Soil
   samples were used to correct for the base level of isotopic enrichment
   at each site.
   3. We found no significant interactions between land use and ant genus
   for isotope enrichment, indicating that trophic structure is conserved
   across land use categories. The fixed relative positions of genera in
   the trophic structure might be re-enforced by competition or some other
   factor. However, the entire ant assemblage had significantly lower delta
   15N values in revegetated sites, suggesting that ants feed lower down in
   the food chain i.e. they are more `herbivorous' in revegetated sites.
   This may be a result of the high availability of plant sugars, honeydew
   and herbivorous arthropod prey.
   4. Surprisingly, ants in remnants and pastures with trees displayed
   similar isotopic compositions. Interactions within ant assemblages are
   thus likely to be resilient to changes in land use, but ant diets in
   early successional habitats may reflect the simplicity of communities,
   which may have comparatively lower rates of saprophagy and predation.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Gibb, H (Corresponding Author), La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3068, Australia.

   potential impacts on a brackish water food web in the Iwaki River
   watershed, northern Japan",ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,2013,28,5,703-716,SEP,"Riverine transport of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from land to the
   ocean is an important carbon flux that influences the carbon budget at
   the watershed scale. However, the dynamics of DIC in an entire river
   network has remained unknown, especially in mountainous Japanese
   watersheds. We examined the effects of watershed land use and geology on
   the transports of inorganic carbon as well as weathered silica (Si) and
   calcium (Ca) in the Iwaki River system where agricultural and
   residential areas have developed in the middle and lower parts of the
   watershed. The concentration and stable carbon isotope ratios (delta
   C-13) of DIC showed the longitudinal increase of C-13-depleted inorganic
   carbon along the river. As a result, most streams and rivers were
   supersaturated in dissolved CO2 that will eventually be emitted to the
   atmosphere. The possible origin of C-13-depleted carbon is CO2 derived
   from the decomposition of organic matter in agricultural and urban
   landscapes, as well as from in-stream respiration. In addition,
   agricultural and urban areas, respectively, exported the large amount of
   dissolved Si and Ca to the rivers, suggesting that CO2 increased by
   respiration accelerates the chemical weathering of silicate and
   carbonate materials in soils, river sediments, and/or urban
   infrastructure. Furthermore, riverine bicarbonate flux is likely to
   enter shell carbonates of Corbicula japonica, an aragonitic bivalve, in
   the downstream brackish lake (Lake Jusan). These results revealed that
   the flux of DIC from the human-dominated watersheds is a key to
   understanding the carbon dynamics and food-web structure along the

   guilds",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,2018,24,8,3642-3653,AUG,"Organic matter produced by the sea ice microbial community (SIMCo) is an
   important link between sea ice dynamics and secondary production in
   near-shore food webs of Antarctica. Sea ice conditions in McMurdo Sound
   were quantified from time series of MODIS satellite images for Sept. 1
   through Feb. 28 of 2007-2015. A predictable sea ice persistence gradient
   along the length of the Sound and evidence for a distinct change in sea
   ice dynamics in 2011 were observed. We used stable isotope analysis
   (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of SIMCo, suspended particulate organic
   matter (SPOM) and shallow water (10-20m) macroinvertebrates to reveal
   patterns in trophic structure of, and incorporation of organic matter
   from SIMCo into, benthic communities at eight sites distributed along
   the sea ice persistence gradient. Mass-balance analysis revealed
   distinct trophic architecture among communities and large fluxes of
   SIMCo into the near-shore food web, with the estimates ranging from 2 to
   84\% of organic matter derived from SIMCo for individual species.
   Analysis of patterns in density, and biomass of macroinvertebrate
   communities among sites allowed us to model net incorporation of organic
   matter from SIMCo, in terms of biomass per unit area (g/m(2)), into
   benthic communities. Here, organic matter derived from SIMCo supported
   39 to 71 per cent of total biomass. Furthermore, for six species, we
   observed declines in contribution of SIMCo between years with persistent
   sea ice (2008-2009) and years with extensive sea ice breakout
   (2012-2015). Our data demonstrate the vital role of SIMCo in ecosystem
   function in Antarctica and strong linkages between sea ice dynamics and
   near-shore secondary productivity. These results have important
   implications for our understanding of how benthic communities will
   respond to changes in sea ice dynamics associated with climate change

   particular, there were fewer primary consumers, mainly small
   crustaceans. These differences in consumer community structure also
   alter trophic interactions. To examine changes in food web structure
   that might result from lower prey abundance, we sampled organisms from
   the 2 sub-estuaries and determined their trophic relationships based on
   nitrogen stable isotope ratios. Reduced numbers of primary consumers,
   and hence lower prey availability, led to changes in food web linkages.
   Specifically, omnivores shifted their diets from an omnivorous diet that
   is mainly carnivorous in the oligotrophic estuary to feeding mainly as

   experiment involving two treatments (with and without fish) with three
   replicates each to determine the effects of fish on the trophic

   trophic structure shifted towards the upper part of the water column
   (more planktonic habitat) in fishless enclosures. Additionally, the
   trophic niche of organisms occupying the base of the food web became
   more diversified when fish were absent, and the trophic redundancy of
   all taxa decreased (more dissimilar trophic niches). Stronger top-down
   effects may also result from global warming, producing increased

   communities of flora and fauna and disrupt their role in assimilating
   and mobilising carbon between the two ecosystems. Riparian spiders that
   predate on emergent aquatic invertebrates can contribute to carbon flux
   and the structure of aquatic and riparian foodwebs. The impact of
   riparian degradation on spiders in temperate rivers of Australia and
   their role in this broader ecosystem function is poorly understood. We
   surveyed the riparian zone of four rivers of south-western Australia in
   areas of natural intact vegetation and degraded agricultural land to
   explore whether riparian spider abundance, and diversity may be affected
   by changes to riparian condition. We also assessed the impact of the
   riparian condition on carbon fluxes between aquatic and terrestrial
   environments, using stable isotope analysis. We found overall abundance
   of riparian spiders was higher in degraded agricultural sites compared
   to natural intact sites and the structure of spider assemblages was
   different. Orb-weaver spiders (Araneidae and Tetragnathidae) were found
   to be more abundant in agricultural areas where canopy cover and
   understory are sparse as a result of livestock grazing and trampling.
   The contribution of carbon from aquatic invertebrates in a natural
   intact site was 48.5\% for Orb-weavers and 41.6\% for Cursorial Hunter
   spiders but reduced to 19.6\% and 39.9\% respectively in a degraded
   agricultural site. These results suggest that the position of spiders in
   riparian foodwebs and the amount of aquatic subsidy may change according
   to the condition and complexity of the riparian zone. (C) 2020 Elsevier

   environmental conditions and resource availability, in turn resulting in
   different trophic pathways. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were
   employed for the whole food web to describe the structure of the food
   web in different sub-basins within Taihu Lake. This lake is a large
   eutrophic freshwater lake that has been intensively managed and highly
   influenced by human activities for more than 50 years. The results show
   significant isotopic differences between basins with different
   environmental characteristics. Such differences likely result from
   isotopic baseline differences combining with a shift in food web
   structure. Both are related to local spatial heterogeneity in nutrient
   loading in waters. Such variation should be explicitly considered in
   future food web studies and ecosystem-based management in this lake

   supply (or ``resource availability{''}), ecosystem size and disturbance
   (or ``environmental variation{''}). In this article, the evidence for
   controls on FCL in freshwater ecosystems is evaluated. First, the
   various ways FCL can be measured are defined. Food-chain length
   typically is estimated as (1) connectance-based FCL-an average
   connectance between basal resources and top consumers, (2) functional
   FCL-by experimental determination of functionally significant effects of
   a top predator on lower trophic-level biomass patterns, and (3) realized
   FCL-an average connectance measure weighted by energy flow between basal
   consumers and the consumer occupying the maximum trophic position in the
   food web. Second, all evidence for relationships between the three
   hypothetical controls and FCL in freshwater ecosystems are evaluated.
   The review includes studies from streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands,
   phytotelmata, and experimental containers. Surprisingly, few studies of
   FCL in freshwaters that test the same suite of controls using the same
   methods are found. Equally compelling results arise from case studies
   based on functional, realized, and connectance-based measures of FCL.
   Third, 10 rules of thumb that could increase similarity of future
   studies, thereby facilitating synthesis across systems, are suggested.
   Fourth, it is discussed how FCL influences the concentration of
   contaminants in large-bodied animals (many of which are consumed by
   humans) as well as the efficacy of biocontrol applications in

   ecological stoichiometry and stable isotope signature of primary
   producers and a wide range of aquatic macroinvertebrates, including

   (2) that the trophic position of several omnivores and the generalist
   predator Notonecta decreased, while the trophic position of most other

   fishes to an invasive ecosystem engineer in a large lake system",FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2023,10,NA,NA,JAN 12,"Species invasions can lead to ecological regime shifts by altering food
   web structure and changing nutrient cycling. Stable isotopes are a
   powerful tool to understand the potential and realized impacts of
   invasive species on food webs, especially when used in tandem with other
   dietary tracers. An invasion by one of the most notorious freshwater
   invaders in North America, the quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis), is
   imminent in Lake Champlain, United States. An invasion by this filter
   feeder has the potential to drastically alter energy pathways and
   destabilize pelagic fisheries via bottom-up impacts. However, the extent
   and magnitude of these impacts depend on the current food web structure
   of the mid-trophic pelagic food web, which was previously not well
   described. We used Bayesian stable isotope mixing models informed by
   stomach content analysis to identify which energy pathways are currently
   most important to mid-trophic level fishes. We determined that in the
   Main Lake basin, the spring phytoplankton bloom and deep chlorophyll
   layer - the resources most vulnerable to quagga mussels - provide a
   disproportionate amount of support to the pelagic food web via
   zooplankton and the migrating macroinvertebrate Mysis. The food web in
   the Northeast Arm of Lake Champlain is supported by epilimnetic
   phytoplankton, which is more protected from the filtration effects of
   quagga mussels than the deep chlorophyll layer. However, the Northeast
   Arm will likely not provide a high-quality foraging refuge to coldwater
   pelagic fish due to unfavorable oxythermal conditions. The mid-trophic
   food web of Lake Champlain-and consequently piscivores who rely on these
   prey-may be vulnerable to the impending quagga mussel invasion if

   by lining the channel bed with concrete to prevent flooding caused by
   land-use changes in the catchment area. Even when eco-friendly works,
   such as fish pools and fish habitat blocks, are incorporated into the

   the food web and, consequently, the amount of food available for fish.
   In this study, the food web structure of the Ooe drainage channel, a
   small concrete-lined stream through an urban area, was investigated
   using stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen. We compared the
   characteristics of the Ooe channel to those of several other aquatic
   systems. We found a single trophic transfer line, from particulate
   organic matter (POM) to benthic fish (Rhinogobius sp.) and crustaceans
   (Palaemon paucidens) via swimming fish (Squalidus chankaensis and
   Pseudorasbora. parva). However, the highest trophic level (benthic fish)
   was only 2.6-2.8 because few planktonic arthropods occurred in the web
   between POM and fish, unlike in more natural bodies of water. In
   addition, neither terrestrial plants nor periphyton were major sources
   of POM. Instead, organic matter from domestic wastewater appeared to be
   the major source of POM in the Ooe channel. Thus, the food web structure

   of exchanges between ecosystems",ECOSCIENCE,2011,18,"3, SI",223-235,NA,"It is increasingly recognized that ecosystems are not closed systems and
   that exchanges of resources across ecosystem boundaries can have
   repercussions on food webs, especially in low productivity systems such
   as the terrestrial Arctic. However, because these exchanges can take
   multiple forms, assessing their significance in the functioning of the
   tundra food web is difficult. In this paper, we first review some
   important concepts related to resource exchanges between ecosystems and
   examine their relevance to the study of trophic interactions in the
   arctic tundra. An analysis of the Bylot Island food web in the Canadian
   Arctic using a mass-balance trophic model suggests that predators are
   the dominant force controlling this food web. However, an important
   feature of this ecosystem is that several top predators benefit from
   allochthonous inputs, either through the presence of migratory birds
   during the summer or the use of the marine environment as a foraging
   ground in winter. We also show that migratory birds may act as
   autochthonous resource exporters for lower trophic levels, for instance
   by removing nitrogen from the nutrient pool when young produced locally
   migrate south and die away from the system. Although these resource
   exchanges may be a general feature of several arctic terrestrial
   ecosystems, their importance in the functioning of the tundra food web
   remains to be determined. Through long-term monitoring, we found that
   primary production in wetlands of Bylot Island increased by 85\% over a
   20-y period, likely a consequence of the warming trend observed in the
   area. However, we have not detected any changes at higher trophic
   levels, which is consistent with a top-down control of this food web.
   Given the importance of resource exchanges between ecosystems in the
   dynamics of the tundra food web, a full investigation of the effects of
   climate change will require a broader cross-ecosystem perspective.",UNIVERSITE LAVAL,"PAVILLON CHARLES-EUGENE MARCHAND, LOCAL 0166, ST FOY, QUEBEC G1K 7P4,

   structure as a result of exploitation and environmental change. These
   shifts can be gradual and unresolved by decadal-scale time series. The
   aim of our study was to determine long-term legacy effects of
   overexploitation and changes to the composition of basal organic matter
   sources on the trophic structure of marine food webs. Location New
   Zealand. Time period Approximately 1250 AD to the present; the complete
   history of human occupation in New Zealand. Major taxa studied
   Mesopredatory fishes. Methods We used whole tissue (delta C-13 and delta
   N-15) and amino acid-specific (delta N-15(AA)) stable isotope analyses
   of bone collagen and muscle tissue from five fishes spanning the period
   of human occupation of New Zealand to resolve the bioenergetic
   consequences of long-term shifts in food web structure. Stable isotope
   analysis of amino acids provided the basis for resolution of changes in
   trophic level in the absence of information on delta N-15 at the base of
   the food web during pre-industrial times. Results Our analyses indicate
   likely declines in the contribution of organic matter derived from kelps
   in four species, and intraspecific increases in trophic levels in three
   species of the five fishes studied between European colonization (AD
   1650-1800) and the present-day regime of industrialized fishing and
   environmental change (AD 1953-2018), but little change during the
   prehistoric time period spanning early Maori occupation (AD 1250-1450)
   to European colonization. Analysis of the bioenergetic costs of the
   observed shifts in food web structure indicate a 179\% increase in basal
   organic matter requirements to support mesopredatory fish. Main
   conclusions These data provide a rare case study on the consequences of
   legacy effects of exploitation and environmental change for
   bioenergetics of fish communities relevant to ongoing changes in global

   subarctic lakes",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2013,58,6,1234-1250,JUN,"Many species are expanding their distribution towards higher latitudes
   and altitudes in response to climate change. These range shifts are
   expected to change fish community structure and alter food-web dynamics
   in subarctic lakes. However, the impacts of invading species on native
   fish and invertebrate prey communities remain understudied. The trophic
   ecology of invasive species determines the likelihood of direct resource
   competition with native taxa. In Northern Europe, perch (Perca
   fluviatilis), a trophic generalist, and ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), a
   benthic specialist, are expanding their distribution ranges northwards,
   colonising lakes inhabited by a native generalist, whitefish (Coregonus
   lavaretus). We predicted that increased fish diversity and density would
   deplete the invertebrate community and increase resource competition
   between native and invasive species. To assess the degree of resource
   competition between native and invasive species, we compared (i) fish
   and invertebrate community structure; (ii) diet and stable carbon and
   nitrogen ratios of whitefish, ruffe and perch and (iii) growth,
   condition and relative population size of whitefish in two non-invaded
   lakes with two lakes containing one and two lakes containing both
   invasive species. Each lake was sampled on a single occasion between
   August and September. Benthic macroinvertebrate density and community
   structure were unaffected by increased consumer diversity, while
   top-down control of pelagic zooplankton density and size was evident in
   lakes with increased fish diversity. Differences in diet and stable
   isotope ratios were evident between all whitefish populations, although
   these were not directly related to the presence of invasive species.
   Specialised adaptations of invasive species may confer a competitive
   advantage in invaded lakes; ruffe dominated the profundal niche, while
   perch displayed an ontogenetic shift to piscivory, reducing niche
   overlap with native whitefish. Growth rate and population density of
   whitefish were largely independent of fish community structure and were
   governed by local variations in lake productivity. However, there was a
   sign of lowered condition of whitefish in invaded systems. Shallow and
   more productive lakes with higher food availability supported
   populations of native and invasive species. Our findings indicate that
   trophic specialisations of invasive species play a key role in
   determining their impacts on the systems they invade. This study
   focussed on early stages of invasion, and the outcome of species
   interactions may change following the establishment of new species. In
   addition, these impacts will not be uniform across the invaded landscape
   as lake-specific variations in morphometry and resource availability
   will alter the competitive balance between native and invasive species.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Hayden, B (Corresponding Author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.

   Lake Ecosystems",ECOSYSTEMS,2016,19,6,955-967,SEP,"Increasing input of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has been
   identified as a widespread environmental phenomenon in many aquatic
   ecosystems. Terrestrial DOC influences basal trophic levels: it can
   subsidize pelagic bacterial production and impede benthic primary
   production via light attenuation. However, little is known about the
   impacts of elevated DOC concentrations on higher trophic levels,
   especially on top consumers. Here, we used Eurasian perch (Perca
   fluviatilis) to investigate the effects of increasing DOC concentrations
   on top predator populations. We applied stable isotope analysis and
   geometric morphometrics to estimate long-term resource and habitat
   utilization of perch. Habitat coupling, the ability to exploit littoral
   and pelagic resources, strongly decreased with increasing DOC
   concentrations due to a shift toward feeding predominantly on pelagic
   resources. Simultaneously, resource use and body morphology became
   increasingly alike for littoral and pelagic perch populations with
   increasing DOC, suggesting more intense competition in lakes with high
   DOC. Eye size of perch increased with increasing DOC concentrations,
   likely as a result of deteriorating visual conditions, suggesting a
   sensory response to environmental change. Increasing input of DOC to
   aquatic ecosystems is a common result of environmental change and might
   affect top predator populations in multiple and complex ways.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Article,English,"Bartels, P (Corresponding Author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol \& Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden.

   ecosystem in the Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia, characterized by
   low coral cover, high sea surface temperature and meso- to eutrophic
   waters. The Marquesas constitute a relevant ecosystem to understand the
   functioning of low diversity reefs that are also subject to global
   change. A multi-tracer assessment of organic matter pathways was run to
   delineate ecosystem functioning, using analysis of fatty acids, bulk and
   compound specific stable isotope analysis and stable isotopes mixing
   models. Macroalgae and phytoplankton were the two major food sources
   fueling this food web with, however, some marked seasonal variations.
   Specifically, zooplankton relied on phytoplankton-derived organic matter
   and herbivorous fishes on macroalgae-derived organic matter to a much
   higher extent in summer than in winter (similar to 75\% vs. similar to
   15\%, and similar to 70 to 75\% vs. similar to 5 to 15\%, respectively)
   . Despite remarkably high delta N-15 values for all trophic
   compartments, likely due to local dynamics in the nitrogen stock,
   trophic levels of consumers were similar to those of other coral reef

   availability of production sources and the energy flow in riverine food
   webs. We hypothesized the carbon source support food web would vary
   among the reaches in response to changing in hydrogeomorphic conditions,

   our hypothesis, three different river reaches in the lower Jinsha River,
   China, were selected and the stable isotope ratios of basal sources and
   dominant consumers were analyzed in three seasons 2015. The relative
   importance of basal sources showed temporal and spatial difference to
   varying degrees. Seston were the most important carbon sources in
   supporting all consumers and the contributions increased from upstream
   to downstream. Riparian C-3 plants played an important supplementary
   role in both reaches above the dam or only in the high flow period.
   Dam-induced flow alteration changed the trophic basis and the
   composition of food webs, resulting in a difference in the food web
   structures, and widening but with lowest complexity food web occurred in

   forest conversion in tropical streams",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,2021,757,NA,NA,FEB 25,"Land use change threatens the ecological integrity of tropical rivers
   and streams; however, few studies have simultaneously analyzed the
   taxonomic and functional responses of tropical macroinvertebrates to
   riparian forest conversion. Here, we used community structure,
   functional diversity, and stable isotope analyses to assess the impacts
   of riparian deforestation on macroinvertebrate communities of streams in
   southern Mexico. Monthly sampling during the dry season was conducted in
   streams with riparian forest (forest streams), and in streams with
   pasture dominating the riparian vegetation (pasture streams). Samples
   were collected for water quality (physical-chemical variables, nutrient
   concentrations, and total suspended solids), organic matter (leaf litter
   abundance and algal biomass), and macroinvertebrate abundance and
   diversity. Higher temperature, conductivity, suspended solids, and
   chlorophyll a were detected in pasture streams, while nitrate
   concentrations and leaf litter biomass were greater in forest streams.
   Maaoinvertebrate density was higher in pasture sites, while no
   differences in taxonomic diversity and richness were found between land
   uses. Functional evenness was greater in forest streams, while richness
   and divergence were similar between land uses, despite differences in
   taxonomic composition. Environmental variables were associated with taxa
   distribution but not with functional traits, suggesting current
   conditions still promote redundancy in ecological function. Isotopic
   analyses indicated consumers in pasture streams were enriched in C-13
   and N-15 relative to forest streams, potentially reflecting the higher
   algal biomass documented in pasture systems. Isotopic niches were
   broader and more overlapped in pasture streams, indicating more
   generalist feeding habits. No significant losses of taxonomic or
   functional diversity were detected in pasture streams. However, changes
   in trophic ecology suggest landscape-level processes are altering
   macroinvertebrate feeding habits in streams. The changes we observed in
   habitat, water quality, and macroinvertebrate community were related to
   the removal of the riparian vegetation, suggesting the structure and
   function of the focal systems would benefit from riparian restoration.

   hampered by its opacity, diversity, and limited niche adaptation. We
   need to expand our insight between the feeding guilds of fauna and not
   just count biodiversity. The soil fauna drive nutrient cycling and play
   a pivotal, but little understood role within both the carbon (C) and
   nitrogen (N) cycles that may be ecosystem dependent. Here, we define the
   structure of the SFW in two habitats (grassland and woodland) on the
   same soil type and test the hypothesis that land management would alter
   the SFW in these habitats. To do this, we census the community structure
   and use stable isotope analysis to establish the pathway of C and N
   through each trophic level within the ecosystems. Stable isotope ratios
   of C and N from all invertebrates were used as a proxy for trophic
   niche, and community-wide metrics were obtained. Our empirically derived
   C/N ratios differed from those previously reported, diverging from model
   predictions of global C and N cycling, which was unexpected. An
   assessment of the relative response of the different functional groups
   to the change from agricultural grassland to woodland was performed.
   This showed that abundance of herbivores, microbivores, and
   micropredators were stimulated, while omnivores and macropredators were
   inhibited in the grassland. Differences between stable isotope ratios
   and community-wide metrics, highlighted habitats with similar taxa had
   different SFWs, using different basal resources, either driven by root
   or litter derived resources. Overall, we conclude that plant type can
   act as a top-down driver of community functioning and that differing

   lakes",NA,2002,31,NA,173-184,NA,"There is growing recognition of the potential contributions of food web
   and ecosystem-level approaches to lake and fisheries management. Often,
   these approaches are data intensive and require information on
   predator-prey interactions and consumer diets. Gut content analysis
   adequately provides population-level diet information, but is more
   limited in ability to provide information at finer (intra-population) or
   coarser (whole food web) organizational scales. In this study, we review
   three applications of stable isotope techniques to studies of bass
   trophic ecology. In each case, the approach is used to provide
   quantitative information at organizational levels that is otherwise
   difficult to obtain using gut content analysis. In the first example, we
   examine intra-population trophic variation in young-of-the-year (YOY)
   smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu. delta(13)C indicated ontogenic
   trophic habitat shifts from pelagic to benthic prey during first summer.
   delta(15)N was correlated with body size on the final sample date,
   suggesting that dietary differences might explain intra-population
   variation in growth rates. The second example demonstrates an
   application of stable isotope techniques to examine impacts of species
   invasion at the whole-food web scale. This approach revealed that lake
   trout Salvelinus namaycush, typically viewed as a pelagic predator, can
   often rely heavily on littoral prey fish.-Reduction in littoral prey
   fish following the invasion of nonnative smallmouth bass and rock bass
   Ambloplites rupestris prompted lake trout to shift towards planktivory.
   The third example uses stable isotope information to classify lakes
   according to their sensitivity to bass invasion. Stable isotope evidence
   indicated that bass and lake trout subsist on separate food chains in
   lakes that contain pelagic prey fish (cisco, lake whitefish, rainbow
   smelt). Thus, bass introductions into these lakes is predicted not to
   affect lake trout populations. Identifying particular lakes and
   lake-types that are sensitive to bass introductions can guide efforts of
   lake managers to minimize negative impacts of bass introductions on lake
   trout.",AMER FISHERIES SOC,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE, STE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Vander Zanden, MJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Limnol, 680 N Pk St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

   diet and trophic position",JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH,2016,42,2,440-447,APR,"Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) are considered threatened and many
   populations have declined since the early 1890s. Limited food web
   studies have been conducted with lacustrine lake sturgeon populations
   while similar studies do not exist for riverine populations. We use
   stable isotope analysis to study the diet composition of lake sturgeon
   captured in the Rainy River, Ontario. Historical reports of lake
   sturgeon consumption of fish and fish eggs exist, but both prey have
   largely been considered as a minor contribution to the overall diet of
   lake sturgeon. More recent dietary studies have focused on juvenile
   sturgeon and report low or no incidence of fish or fish eggs in lake
   sturgeon diets. The results of the stable isotope studies of Rainy River
   lake sturgeon suggest they obtain a large portion of their energy from
   organic material derived directly or indirectly from fish. Results
   parallel those recently reported for adult sturgeon in Lake Winnebago,
   Wisconsin, and are important in the context of contributing modem
   technical verification to earlier historical reports of fish and fish
   eggs in lake sturgeon diets. The results of this study provide evidence
   of potential seasonal or temporal shifts in lake sturgeon diet and
   further evidence to the potential shift in resource use based on life
   stage. Estimates of isotopic niches for the Rainy River sturgeon
   establish an important baseline for future changes in food web structure

   addition of anthropogenic stressors that could have implications for

   NEVEZIS RIVER, LITHUANIA",ACTA ICHTHYOLOGICA ET PISCATORIA,2016,46,4,303-312,NA,"Background. The catchment of the Nevezis River, the sixth longest river
   in Lithuania, is among the most affected by agricultural activities.
   Although seriously disturbed by land reclamation and agricultural
   pollution, the Nevezis River still has natural, anthropogenically
   unaffected stretches. Fish species were studied at two sites of the
   upper part of the river with different hydrological regime, exhibiting
   clear differences in the trophic status of fish. The combined effect of
   hydrogeomorphic and water-chemistry variability on the stable isotope
   composition of fish assemblages in Lithuania has not been investigated.
   The presently reported study was intended to explore the possible
   effects of the riverbed morphology and agricultural activities on the
   chemistry and stable isotope composition of the three main fish species.
   Materials and methods. This study covered three species of freshwater
   fishes: the European perch, Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758; the roach,
   Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758); and the northern pike, Esox lucius
   Linnaeus, 1758. The sampling was performed in both natural and regulated
   river stretches using backpack electrofishing equipment. Stable isotope
   composition of the samples was revealed by applying stable isotope
   analyses (SIA) with an elemental analyser connected to an isotope ratio
   mass spectrometer. To obtain more information about environmental
   variability and variation of stable isotopes delta C-13 and delta N-15
   in fish, the entire data matrix was analysed using Principal Component
   Analysis (PCA).
   Results. In the study sites on the Nevezis River, algal carbon isotope
   ratios were more C-13-depleted than those from terrestrial sources. The
   fishes were clearly dependent on terrestrial carbon sources in natural
   locations. However, the fishes collected from regulated sites had carbon
   isotope signatures more similar to algal than to terrestrial sources.
   Mean values of delta N-15 of the fishes from the natural sites were
   lower than those from the regulated ones.
   Conclusion. The presently reported study revealed impact of abiotic
   habitat variables indicating the importance of physicochemical and
   morphological characteristics on delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic
   values variance of fish at natural and regulated river sites. Our
   findings would help to evaluate and predict changes on river food webs
   that occur due to hydromorphological alterations determined by human
   activity and climate change. The results could be useful for fisheries,

   Great Lakes, is a potential competitor with fish for zooplankton prey.
   We used stable C and N isotope ratios to elucidate trophic relationships
   between C. pengoi, zooplankton (microzooplankton, 90-200 mu m, mostly
   copepod nauplii and rotifers; mesozooplankton, > 200 mu m, mostly
   copepods), and zooplanktivorous fish (herring, size range 5-15 cm and
   sprat, 9-11 cm) in a coastal area of the northern Baltic Sea. The
   isotope ratios in C. pengoi and fish were much higher than those of
   zooplankton, showing general trends of enrichment with trophic level.
   Young-of-the-year (YOY) herring had a significantly higher N-15/N-14
   ratio than C. pengoi, suggesting of a trophic linkage between the two
   species. To evaluate the possible relative importance of different food
   sources for C. pengoi and YOY herring, two-source isotope-mixing models
   for N were used, with micro- and mesozooplankton as prey for C. pengoi
   and mesozooplankton and C. pengoi as prey for YOY herring. These models
   indicate that mesozooplankton was the major food source of both species.
   However, microzooplankton may be important prey for young stages of C.
   pengoi. Comparative analyses of the herring trophic position before and
   after the invasion by C. pengoi showed a trophic level shift from 2.6 to
   3.4, indicating substantial alterations in the food web structure. Our

   trophic interactions and food web structure within an ecosystem.
   However, our ability to predict how species' interactions will vary
   spatially and temporally in response to seasonal variation unfortunately
   remains inadequate within most ecosystems. Fish assemblages in the Tonle
   Sap Lake (TSL) of Cambodia-a dynamic flood-pulse ecosystem-were studied
   for five years (2010-2014) using stable isotope and Bayesian statistical
   approaches to explore both within-and among-species isotopic niche
   variation associated with seasonal flooding. Roughly 600 individual fish
   specimens were collected during 19 sampling events within the lake. We
   found that fishes within the same species tended to have a broader
   isotopic niche during the wet season, likely reflecting assimilation of
   resources from either a wider range of isotopically distinct prey items
   or a variety of habitats, or both. Furthermore, among-species isotopic
   niches tended to overlap and range more broadly during the wet season,
   suggesting that floodplain inundation promotes exploitation of more
   diverse and similar resources by different species in the fish
   community. Our study highlights that the flood-pulse dynamic that is
   typical of tropical aquatic ecosystems may be an essential element
   supporting freshwater fish community structure and the fish diversity

   analysis, we examined spatiotemporal variation in food web structure at
   four sites in the upper Yeilrmak River, Anatolia Peninsula, Turkey, in
   relation to environmental parameters and a dam. It was apparent that the

   assemblages from different sites and seasons occupied distinct areas of

Article,Winda Ika Susanti and Rahayu Widyastuti and Stefan Scheu and Anton Potapov,"Trophic niche differentiation and utilisation of food resources in
   Collembola is altered by rainforest conversion to plantation systems",PEERJ,2021,9,NA,NA,MAR 2,"Intensively managed monoculture plantations are increasingly replacing
   natural forests across the tropics resulting in changes in ecological
   niches of species and communities, and in ecosystem functioning.
   Collembola are among the most abundant arthropods inhabiting the
   belowground system sensitively responding to changes in vegetation and
   soil conditions. However, most studies on the response of Collembola to
   land-use change were conducted in temperate ecosystems and focused on
   shifts in community composition or morphological traits, while
   parameters more closely linked to ecosystem functioning, such as trophic
   niches, received little attention. Here, we used stable isotope analysis
   (C-13 and N-15) to investigate changes in the trophic structure and use
   of food resources by Collembola in Jambi province (Sumatra, Indonesia),
   a region that experienced strong deforestation in the last decades.
   Isotopic values of Collembola from 32 sites representing four land-use
   systems were analyzed (rainforest, rubber agroforest, rubber (Hevea
   brasiliansis) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) monoculture plantations).
   Across Collembola species Delta C-13 values were highest in rainforest
   suggesting more pronounced processing of litter resources by
   microorganisms and consumption of these microorganisms by Collembola in
   this system. Lower Delta C-13 values, but high Delta C-13 variation in
   Collembola in oil palm plantations indicated that Collembola shifted
   towards herbivory and used more variable resources in this system. Small
   range in Delta N-15 values in Collembola species in monoculture
   plantations in comparison to rainforest indicated that conversion of
   rainforest into plantations is associated with simplification in the
   trophic structure of Collembola communities. This was further confirmed
   by generally lower isotopic niche differentiation among species in
   plantations. Across the studied ecosystems, atmobiotic species
   (Symphypleona and Paronellidae) occupied the lowest, whereas euedaphic
   Collembola species occupied the highest trophic position, resembling
   patterns in temperate forests. Some species of Paronellidae in
   rainforest and jungle rubber had Delta N-15 values below those of leaf
   litter suggesting algivory (Salina sp.1, Callyntrura sp.1 and
   Lepidonella sp.1), while a dominant species, Pseudosinella sp.1, had the
   highest Delta N-15 values in most of the land-use systems suggesting
   that this species at least in part lives as predator or scavenger.
   Overall, the results suggest that rainforest conversion into plantation
   systems is associated with marked shifts in the structure of trophic
   niches in soil and litter Collembola with potential consequences for
   ecosystem functioning and food-web stability.",PEERJ INC,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Susanti, WI (Corresponding Author), Georg August Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool \& Anthropol, Gottingen, Germany.

Article,LA Levin and C Neira and ED Grosholz,Invasive cordgrass modifies wetland trophic function,ECOLOGY,2006,87,2,419-432,FEB,"Vascular plants strongly control belowground environments in most
   ecosystems. Invasion by vascular plants in coastal wetlands, and by
   cordgrasses (Spartina spp.) in particular, are increasing in incidence
   globally, with dramatic ecosystem-level consequences. We examined the
   trophic consequences of' invasion by a Spartina hybrid (S. alterniflora
   X S. foliosa) in San Francisco Bay (USA) by documenting differences in
   biomass and trophic structure of benthic communities between sediments
   invaded by Spartina and uninvaded sediments. We found the invaded system
   shifted from all algae-bascd to a detritus-based food web. We then
   tested for a relationship between diet and tolerance to invasion,
   hypothesizing that species that consume Spartina detritus are more
   likely to inhabit invaded sediments than those that consume surface
   algae. Infaunal diets were initially examined with natural abundance
   stable isotope analyses and application of mixing models, but these
   yielded an ambiguous picture of food sources. Therefore, we conducted
   isotopic enrichment experiments by providing N-15-labeled Spartina
   detritus both on and below the sediment surface in areas that either
   contained Spartina or were unvegetated. Capitellid and nereid
   polychaetes, and oligochaetes, groups shown to persist following
   Spartina invasion of San Francisco Bay tidal flats, took up N-15 from
   labeled native and invasive Spartina detritus. In contrast, We found
   that amphipods, bivalves, and other taxa less tolerant to invasion
   consumed primarily surficial algae, based oil C-13 enrichment
   experiments. Habitat (Spartina vs. unvegetated patches) and location of'
   detritus (on or within sediments) did not affect N-15 uptake from
   cletritus. Our investigations support a ``trophic shift{''} model for
   ecosystem response to wetland plant invasion and preview loss of key
   trophic support for fishes and migratory birds by shifting dominance to
   species not widely consumed by species at higher trophic levels.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Levin, LA (Corresponding Author), Scripps Inst Oceanog, Integrat Oceanog Div, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.

   a Subtropical Benthic Food Web, Hong Kong",FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,2022,9,NA,NA,JUN 16,"Anthropogenic nutrient input to coastal waters is one of the most common
   disturbances within inshore marine benthic communities. Organic
   enrichment in sediments leads to the reduction or disappearance of
   sensitive organisms, and influences the quality and quantity of primary
   producers which serve as food sources for the benthic fauna. Such
   changes, in turn, affect the energy flow and food-web interactions in
   benthic communities. To examine how organic enrichment may alter marine
   benthic trophic relationship, a stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta
   N-15) analysis of the potential food sources and a range of meiofauna
   and polychaetes from an organically polluted and a relatively unpolluted
   site was compared in subtropical waters of Hong Kong. Results indicated
   that some omnivorous infauna shifted from a mainly carnivorous diet at
   the unpolluted site to a largely herbivorous diet at the organically
   polluted site. This dietary shift is likely to be related to the oxygen
   stress, prey limitation and increased abundance and nutritional quality
   of primary producers in the eutrophic area, resulting in an increase in
   utilization of plant materials as the major food source. The present
   findings suggest that such changes in trophic position induced by
   organic enrichment can provide further insights into the structure and

   system with implications for the magnitude and timing of Arctic pelagic
   and ice-associated (sympagic) primary production that influences food
   web interactions. Ringed seals (Pusa hispida) are generalist predators
   that, as a species experience vastly different icescapes from low to
   high-Arctic latitudes. Quantifying spatial variation in their diet can
   help us understand how changes in sea-ice dynamics affect trophic
   interactions in Arctic marine food webs. However, multiple complementary
   analytical tools to examine variation in carbon source use and trophic
   dynamics in the diet of ringed seals have not yet been applied across
   their latitudinal range in the Arctic. We conducted stable isotope
   analysis (delta 13C and delta 15N) and measured highly branched
   isoprenoid diatom lipid biomarkers of ringed seals from the low,
   intermediate, and high Arctic (from 61.1 degrees N to 77.5 degrees N) to
   investigate spatial variation in their carbon source use and trophic
   position in relation to sea-ice dynamics. Both delta 13C and highly
   branched isoprenoids indicated that ringed seals from higher latitudes
   had more sympagic carbon in their diet (liver delta 13C: -18.3 +/- 0.2
   \%o, HBI: 89.9 +/- 2.08 \%) than ringed seals at lower latitudes (liver
   delta 13C: -21.1 +/- 0.1 \%o, HBI: 22.0 +/- 2.73 \%). Ringed seal
   trophic position increased from the low (3.78 +/- 0.02) to high (4.76
   +/- 0.03) Arctic, suggesting increased fish consumption or a different
   trophic structure coinciding with the latitudinal change in carbon
   source. Ringed seals demonstrated a clear shift from low to high Arctic
   in the relative contribution of phytoplanktonic vs sympagic primary
   production. These patterns are likely linked to the vastly different
   icescapes in these environments and demonstrate that shifts in primary
   producer composition and Arctic food webs can be identified in ringed
   seal diets. Information on these prey and energy shifts over large
   spatial scales also provides insights into potential future changes to

   long-term change in food web structure and nutrient cycling. We
   retrospectively analyse elemental composition (C, N and P) and stable
   isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) in archived monitoring samples of two
   important taxa from the bottom of the food web; the filamentous
   ephemeral macroalgae Cladophora spp. and the blue mussel Mytilus edulis
   trossulus from three contrasting regions in the Baltic Sea (coastal
   Bothnian Sea and Baltic Proper, open sea central Baltic). The aim is to
   statistically link the observed spatial and interannual (8-24 years'
   time-series) variability in elemental and isotope baselines with their
   biomass trends and to the oceanographic monitoring data reflecting the
   ongoing environmental changes (i.e., eutrophication and climate) in this
   system. We find clear differences in isotope baselines between the two
   major Baltic Sea basins. However, the temporal variation in Mytilus
   delta C-13 was similar among regions and, at the open sea station,
   mussels and algae delta C-13 also correlated over time, likely
   reflecting a global (Suess) effect, whereas delta N-15 of both taxa
   varied with local and regional dissolved nitrogen concentrations in
   water. delta N-15 in source amino acids allowed detection of
   diazotrophic N in Mytilus, which was masked in bulk delta N-15. Finally,
   Cladophora N:P reflected regional nutrient levels in the water while
   P\%, which differed for both taxa, was linked to food quality for
   Mytilus. This study highlights the potential of a multi-taxa and

   stable isotope-derived community-wide metrics to describe spatiotemporal
   variation in trophic niches and trophic structures of fish assemblages
   in a tributary of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China where water
   level regulation is put into operation annually. A longitudinally
   increasing trophic space was discovered in this tributary especially
   when the water level was low. Trophic diversity declined and trophic
   redundancy increased from the non-flood period to flood season at the
   upper backwater region. However, trophic space was more stable in the
   estuarine site. The site differences were associated with availability
   of food resource and pathway of consumers, as specifically, disturbance
   derived from flow pulse at the end of backwater site altered diet
   composition of the fish consumers, while immense water body in the lower
   confluence area limited the flood influences as well as promoted
   exploitation of diverse available sources. Moreover, the declined water
   level control facilitated the contraction of the trophic niche size at
   the tail backwater site because of remarkable riverine morphology
   alternation leading to decreasing water body whereas the rising water
   level regulation homogenized trophic structure along the downstream

   intense commercial exploitation",ECOLOGY,2014,95,1,164-172,JAN,"Marine ecosystems are increasingly at risk from overexploitation and
   fisheries collapse. As managers implement recovery plans, shifts in
   species interactions may occur broadly with potential consequences for
   ecosystem structure and function. In kelp forests off San Nicolas
   Island, California, USA, we describe striking changes in size structure
   and life history traits (e.g., size at maturation and sex change) of a
   heavily fished, ecologically important predator, the California
   sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher). These changes occurred in two phases:
   (1) after intense commercial fishery exploitation in the late 1990s and
   (2) following recovery in the late 2000s, nearly a decade after
   management intervention. Using gut contents and stable-isotope values of
   sheephead and their prey, we found evidence for a dietary niche
   expansion upon recovery of population size structure to include
   increased consumption of sea urchins and other mobile invertebrate
   grazers by larger sized fish. By examining historical diet data and a
   time series of benthic community composition, we conclude that changes
   in dietary niche breadth are more likely due to the recovery of size
   structure from fishing than major shifts in prey availability.
   Size-dependent predator-prey interactions may have ecosystem
   consequences and management measures that preserve or restore size
   structure, and therefore historical trophic roles of key predators,
   could be vital for maintaining kelp forest ecosystem health.",ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Article,English,"Hamilton, SL (Corresponding Author), Moss Landing Marine Labs, 8272 Moss Landing Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.

   carbon and nitrogen isotopes",JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH,2015,41,"3, SI",104-114,NA,"Within the last few decades Lake Michigan's plankton community has
   undergone substantial changes. Oligotrophication of the pelagic zone has
   led to a decrease in zooplankton biomass, while species composition has
   shifted, with copepod species becoming more dominant. Although these
   observations have been relatively well documented, their implications
   for the food web have not been well addressed. To define feeding
   relationships within the zooplankton community, we measured the stable
   carbon and nitrogen isotope composition and biomass of major zooplankton
   species, three seston size classes, and seston collected from three
   depths in southeastern Lake Michigan. Nitrogen stable isotope ratios
   suggest a complex plankton food web with zooplankton appearing to occupy
   at least three distinct trophic positions. The large calanoid copepod
   Limnocalanus macrurus occupied a tertiary consumer trophic position,
   more than one trophic position above all other zooplankton species
   sampled. Carbon stable isotopes revealed significant differences among
   zooplankton species. Though the mechanisms responsible for these
   differences are not clear, these results suggest that there is
   significant partitioning of resources at the base of the food web. (C)

   establishment of the Ponto-Caspian invader <i>Dikerogammarus
   villosus</i>",HYDROBIOLOGIA,2006,565,NA,39-58,JUL,"The Rhine ecosystem is highly influenced by anthropogenic stresses from
   pollution, intensive shipping and increased connectivity with other
   large European rivers. Canalization of the Rhine resulted in a reduction
   of heterogeneity to two main biotopes: sandy streambeds and riverbanks
   consisting of groyne stones. Both biotopes are heavily subjected to
   biological invasions, affecting the rivers food web structure. The
   Ponto-Caspian amphipods, Chelicorophium curvispinum and Dikerogammarus
   villosus, have exerted the highest impact on this food web. The
   filterfeeding C. curvispinum dominated the Rhine food web on the stones
   in 1998, swamping the stone substrata with mud. However, in 2001 it
   decreased in numbers, most likely due to top-down regulation caused by
   increased parasitic and predatory pressure of other more recently
   invaded Ponto-Caspian species. D. villosus showed a fast population
   increase after its invasion and particularly influenced the
   macroinvertebrate community on the stones by predaceous omnivory. This
   species seemed to have maintained its predatory level after its
   population established. Effects of these mass invaders on the
   macroinvertebrate community of sandy streambeds in the Rhine are
   unclear. Here, low densities of macroinvertebrates were observed with
   the Asiatic clam, Corbicula fluminea, as most abundant species. Stable
   isotope values of food webs from the stones and sand in 2001 were
   similar. Aquatic macrophytes are nearly absent and the food web is
   fuelled by phytoplankton and particulate organic matter, originating
   from riparian vegetation as indicated by similar delta C-13 values.
   Omnivores, filter-, deposit-, and detritus-feeders are the primary and
   secondary macroinvertebrate consumers and function as keystone species
   in transferring energy to higher trophic levels. Invaders comprise 90\%
   of the macroinvertebrate numbers, and can be considered ecosystem
   engineers determining the functional diversity and food web structure of
   the Rhine by either bottom-up or top-down regulation.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Article; Proceedings Paper,English,"van der Velde, G (Corresponding Author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Anim Ecol \& Ecophysiol, Sect Aquat Anim Ecol, Inst Wetland \& Water Res, Toernooiveld 1, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands.

   of primary production and how it is transferred among consumer species
   is required to properly manage and conserve subpolar ecosystems that are
   particularly vulnerable to environmental changes. We used carbon (delta
   C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope analysis to establish a
   baseline of species interactions and food web structure for the
   nearshore marine community in Bahia Lapataia, Argentina, an ecosystem
   that faces many threats, including a recent invasion of exotic chinook
   salmon. Primary producers and other organic sources (e.g., particulate
   organic matter) available to the food web were isotopically distinct and
   had a wide range in delta C-13 (-31.3 to -5.3 parts per thousand) and
   delta N-15 (-0.5 to 13.1 parts per thousand) values. Consumers also
   showed a wide range of isotope values with mean delta C-13 and delta
   N-15 values ranging from -20.8 to -12.3 parts per thousand and from 10.5
   to 19.6 aEuro degrees, respectively. A cluster analysis of these isotope
   data correctly identified functional groups and expected interactions
   among species based on independent information. Using Bayesian isotope
   mixing models, we estimated that the proportional contribution of
   benthic production, in particular through grazing and the consumption of
   detritus, was a more important source of energy for primary and
   secondary consumers than pelagic production. Using stable isotope
   analysis to continually monitor species interactions and food web
   structure may prove to be a valuable research and management tool for

   structure is essential, but baseline isotope values are often assumed to
   be spatially homogeneous, even in large aquatic ecosystems. To test this
   assumption in large lakes, we quantified spatial variation in delta
   C-13, delta N-15 (deposit-feeding Oligochaeta and filter-feeding
   Dreissena spp.), and delta S-34 (Dreissena spp. only) and density in
   Lake Erie between 2014 and 2016. Lake Erie's three distinct basins
   differ in size, bathymetry, and nutrient loading, making it an excellent
   system for exploring spatial variation in stable isotopes of baseline
   organisms. Dreissena spp. densities were highest in the western and
   lowest in the seasonally hypoxic central basin, while Oligochaeta
   densities were relatively consistent throughout Lake Erie. Values of
   delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta S-34 exhibited distinct spatial trends
   that were not related to population densities but followed the west to
   east direction of water flow within the lake. For both taxa, delta C-13
   was lower in the deeper, oligotrophic east basin than the shallow,
   mesotrophic west basin, and delta N-15 and delta S-34 increased from
   west to east. Spatial patterns of low delta S-34 in Dreissena spp. in
   the western and central basins were likely related to hypoxia, whereas
   patterns of delta N-15 in both taxa were probably related to the greater
   influence of agricultural land uses in the western basin. Spatial trends
   of stable isotopes in large lake zoobenthos are driven by complex
   interactions of environmental gradients, which could introduce bias in

   Nonpelagic source contributions and trophic positions of dominant

   appeared to have decreased the number of large oysters and to have
   increased the percentage of reefs that were nonliving by decreasing
   water column filtration and benthopelagic coupling. The differences in

   Using stable isotope analysis of two seasonal molts and bone collagen,

   populations across their range and through time. We find pika isotopic
   diet to be stable across both time and space compared with other animals

   We find that climatic, not geographic, factors explain part of the

   from the fall-onset molt decrease with relative humidity of the
   environment and delta N-15 values from bone collagen increase with
   temperature and precipitation. We find a small but significant seasonal
   difference in delta C-13, which could be explained by microbial
   enrichment of cached haypiles. We establish a baseline of pika isotopic

   river floodplain wetland ecosystem",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2020,10,1,NA,JUL 31,"Large rivers, including the Murray River system in southeast Australia,
   are disturbed by many activities. The arrival of European settlers to
   Australia by the mid-1800s transformed many floodplain wetlands of the
   lower Murray River system. River impoundment and flow regulation in the
   late 1800s and, from the 1930s, resulted in species invasion, and
   elevated nutrient concentrations causing widespread eutrophication. An
   integrated palaeoecology, and palaeo-and-modern food web approach,
   incorporating mixing models, was undertaken to reveal changes in a
   regulated wetland (i.e. Kings Billabong). The lack of preserved sediment
   suggests the wetland was naturally intermittent before 1890. After this
   time, when used as a water retention basin, the wetland experienced net
   sediment accumulation. Subfossil cladocerans, and delta C-13 of Daphnia,
   chironomid, and bulk sediment, all reflected an early productive, likely
   clear water state and shifts in trophic state following river regulation
   in the 1930s. Food web mixing models, based on delta C-13 and delta N-15
   in subfossil and modern Daphnia, fish, and submerged and emergent
   macrophytes, also indicated a shift in the trophic relationships between
   fish and Daphnia. By the 1970s, a new state was established but a
   further significant alteration of nitrogen and carbon sources, and
   trophic interactions, continued through to the early 2000s. A possible
   switch from Daphnia as a prey of Australian Smelt could have modified
   the food web of the wetland by c. 2006. The timing of this change
   corresponded to the expansion of emergent macrophytes possibly due to
   landscape level disruptions. The evidence of these changes suggests a
   need for a broader understanding of the evolution of wetlands for the
   management of floodplains in the region.",NATURE RESEARCH,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Article,English,"Kattel, GR (Corresponding Author), Federat Univ Australia, Sch Sci Psychol \& Sport, Mt Helen, Vic 3350, Australia.

   endangered San Joaquin kit fox (<i>Vulpes macrotis mutica</i>)",JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,2010,91,6,1313-1321,DEC 16,"The unprecedented rate of urbanization over the past several decades is
   a major concern for conservation globally and has given rise to the
   multidisciplinary field of urban ecology. This field explores the direct
   and indirect effects of human activities on food-web dynamics, community
   structure, and animal behavior in highly modified urban ecosystems.
   Urban ecosystems are typically characterized by reduced species
   diversity but increased abundance of a few species able to exploit
   anthropogenic food sources. For many urban mammalian and avian species
   direct resource subsidization is difficult to assess using traditional
   means such as scat analysis. Here we show how stable isotope analysis
   can be used to assess the exploitation of anthropogenic foods in an
   endangered carnivore, the San Joaquin kit fox (Vuipes macrotis mutica)
   inhabiting the southern San Joaquin Valley in California. Examination of
   carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope data shows that
   kit foxes living in urban Bakersfield, California, extensively exploit
   anthropogenic foods, which sharply contrasts with dietary data derived
   from scat analysis. Urban kit foxes had significantly higher delta C-13
   and lower delta N-15 values than foxes from adjacent nonurban areas and
   had similar isotope values as Bakersfield human residents, which
   suggests a shared food source. In contrast, examination of isotopic data
   for nonurban kit foxes shows that they largely consume the most abundant
   natural prey species found in their scats. Stable isotope analysis
   offers a rapid and cost-effective means of evaluating the degree to
   which urban wildlife populations exploit anthropogenic foods in areas
   where native C-4 vegetation is relatively uncommon or absent, important
   in assessing the direct impacts of human activities on food-web dynamics
   in urban ecosystems. We anticipate that the isotopic gradients used here
   will be useful in assessing the exploitation of anthropogenic foods in
   other urban wildlife populations. DOI: 10.1644/09-MAMM-A-362.1.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",Article,English,"Newsome, SD (Corresponding Author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool \& Physiol, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82070 USA.

   habitats, plays an important role in ecosystem functioning. In this
   study, we provide a global investigation of lake habitat coupling by
   freshwater fishes between littoral (nearshore) and pelagic (open water)

   according to environmental context and consumer traits. We consider the
   influence of lake factors (surface area, depth, shoreline complexity,
   and annual temperature), relative trophic position of consumers, fish
   community species richness, and fish morphological traits on habitat
   coupling by fishes. Using a worldwide dataset consisting of fish stable
   isotope values (\& delta;C-13 and \& delta;N-15), we developed an index
   of habitat coupling, and used Bayesian hierarchical and non-hierarchical
   beta regressions to estimate the effects of environmental lake context
   and morphological traits on habitat coupling by fishes. Our results show
   high rates of habitat coupling among fishes globally with marked
   taxonomic differences in the magnitude and variation. Habitat coupling
   was higher in lower elevation lakes and in regions characterized by
   relatively colder climates, whereas other environmental context factors
   had little or no effects on habitat coupling. Furthermore, habitat
   coupling was associated with several locomotion and feeding traits, but
   independent from species maximum body length. Overall, we highlight the

   partially implicated in reduction of the fish species diversity. Lake
   Albert is facing multiple environmental changes, including declining
   fish species diversity, hyper-eutrophication, hypoxia, and reduced fish
   catches. To examine the role of Nile perch and Nile tilapia in the food
   web in their native Lake Albert, we estimated their diets using stable
   nitrogen and carbon isotopes. In Lake Albert, the tilapiine congeners
   (closely related species), Tilapia zillii, Oreochromis leucostictus, and
   Sarethorodon galilaeus, and the centropomid Nile perch congener, Lates
   macrophthalmus, have narrower diet breath in the presence of the native
   O. niloticus and L. niloticus. A computerized parameter search of
   dietary items for five commercially important fish species (Hydrocynus
   forskahlii, Bagrus bayad, L. niloticus, Alestes baremose and Brycinus
   nurse) was completed using a static isotopic mixing model. The outcome
   of the simulation for most fish species compared favorably to previously
   published stomach contents data for the Lake Albert fishes dating back
   to 1928, demonstrating agreement between stable isotope values and
   analyses of stomach contents. While there were some indications of
   changes in the diets of L. niloticus and A. baremose diets over the past
   20 years in parallel with other changes in the lake, for the most part,

   vertically partition resources within stratified lakes in response to
   life history trade-offs that are governed by predators, the quantity and

   European forests and changes the quality and availability of resources
   of the decomposer system. These changes likely alter the structure and
   functioning of soil animal food webs. Using stable isotope analysis
   (C-13, N-15) we investigated the trophic position and resource use of
   soil animal species in each of four forest types (coniferous, young
   managed beech, old managed beech and unmanaged beech forests) across
   three regions in Germany. Twenty-eight species of soil invertebrates
   were analyzed covering three consumer levels and a representative
   spectrum of feeding types and morphologies. Data on stable isotope
   signatures of leaf litter, fine roots and soil were included to evaluate
   to which extent signatures of soil animals vary with those of local
   resources. Soil animal N-15 and C-13 signatures varied with the
   respective signatures of leaf litter and fine roots. After calibration
   to leaf litter signatures, soil animal stable isotope signatures of the
   different beech forests did not differ significantly. However, thick
   leaf litter layers, such as those in coniferous forests, were associated
   with low animal stable isotope signatures presumably due to reduced
   access of decomposer animals to root-derived resources, suggesting that
   the decomposer food web is shifted towards leaf litter based energy
   pathways with the shift affecting all consumer levels. Variation in
   stable isotope signatures of soil animal species with litter quality
   parameters suggests that nutrition of third level but not first and
   second level consumers is related to litter quality, potentially due to
   microorganisms locking up litter resources thereby hampering their

   ecosystem processes, current ecological research stresses the importance
   of understanding the trophic structure of soil communities in order to
   better predict the effects that global environmental change can have on
   the soil food web structure and dynamics. Using stable isotope analysis,
   we examined the trophic ecology of six soil oribatid mite species
   present in the leaf litter of beech forests which mainly differed in
   mean annual precipitation. We explored the relationship between animal
   and leaf litter signatures to determine which of the two approaches,
   conventional calibration or a novel solution we offer using statistical
   control (i.e., isotopic signature of the basal resource included as a
   covariate in the model), is more adequate to evaluate the trophic
   structure of soil communities across different sites, and investigated
   if the trophic niches of the species varied under two different
   precipitation regimes. The trophic position of some species varied with
   rainfall; the observed enrichment in N-15 in dry forests reflects
   trophic and spatial shifts probably resulting from changes in microbial
   activity and community composition. In addition, we find interactive
   effects between precipitation and the basal resource for some species
   and a lack of correlation between resource and oribatid mite stable
   isotope values for others. We discuss the pertinence of using
   conventional data calibration as it appears to mask relevant trends
   regarding the trophic ecology of oribatid mite species, and suggest
   using statistical control (a covariate approach) instead. (C) 2017

   closely related alpine bird species that form relict populations in the
   European Alps. Besides manifold anthropogenic influences in this region,
   global climate change is forecast to lead to significant changes in
   temperatures and precipitation. We here analysed stable isotope ratios
   (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of feathers of both bird species and their
   potential dietary plants across a longitudinal precipitation gradient in
   south-east Switzerland.
   Plant delta C-13 was higher at higher altitudes and in drier areas
   (coinciding with higher longitudes) while plant delta N-15 did not
   differ geographically. Black grouse delta C-13 reflected the
   longitudinal pattern in precipitation and plant delta C-13, and there
   was no indication for a change in dietary composition with precipitation
   (i.e. no significant changes in delta N-15). In contrast, rock ptarmigan
   delta C-13 was independent of precipitation and plant delta C-13 values
   and showed a significant increase in delta N-15 towards drier areas,
   suggesting a potential dietary shift.
   In rock ptarmigan, we furthermore investigated intraspecific differences
   with age, between males and females and among years, and did not find
   any biologically meaningful intraspecific differences.
   Interspecifically, rock ptarmigan feathers had significantly higher
   delta C-13 and lower delta N-15 values than black grouse, reflecting a
   dietary segregation between both species. This may partly he due to the
   higher attitudinal distribution of rock ptarmigan in combination with an
   attitudinal gradient in plant delta C-13. In addition, however, species
   also segregated in delta N-15, most likely caused by a higher proportion
   of invertebrate diet in black grouse.",ELSEVIER GMBH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",Article,English,"Dehnhard, N (Corresponding Author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Behav Ecol \& Ecophysiol Grp, Campus Drie Eiken,Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Wilrijk, Belgium.

   subsistence economy in ancient China in response to global climate
   change",PLOS ONE,2019,14,7,NA,JUL 22,"Prior to the introduction of wheat and barley from Central Asia during
   the Neolithic period, northern Chinese agricultural groups subsisted
   heavily on millet. Despite being the focus of many decades of intensive
   interest and research, the exact route(s), date(s), and mechanisms of
   the spread and adoption of wheat and barley into the existing
   well-established millet-based diet in northern China are still debated.
   As the majority of the important introduced crops are C-3 plants, while
   the indigenous millet is C-4, archaeologists can effectively identify
   the consumption of any introduced crops using stable carbon isotope
   analysis. Here we examine published stable isotope and dental caries
   data of human skeletal remains from 77 archaeological sites across
   northern and northwestern China. These sites date between 9000 to 1750
   BP, encompassing the period from the beginning of agriculture to wheat's
   emergence as a staple crop in northern China. The aim of this study is
   to evaluate the implications of the spread and adoption of these crops
   in ancient China. Detailed analysis of human bone collagen delta C-13
   values reveals an almost concurrent shift from a C-4-based to a mixed
   C-3/ C-4-based subsistence economy across all regions at around
   4500-4000 BP. This coincided with a global climatic event, Holocene
   Event 3 at 4200 BP, suggesting that the sudden change in subsistence
   economy across northern and northwestern China was likely related to
   climate change. Moreover, the substantially increased prevalence of
   dental caries from pre-to post-4000 BP indicates an increase in the
   consumption of cariogenic cereals during the later period. The results
   from this study have significant implications for understanding how the
   adoption of a staple crop can be indicative of large-scale environmental
   and socio-political changes in a region.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Article,English,"Cheung, C; Zhang, H; Richards, MP (Corresponding Author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Archaeol, Burnaby, BC, Canada.

   CE, we infer a shift to increased pelagic foraging around the 16th
   century in Mediterranean BFT. This likely reflects the early
   anthropogenic exploitation of inshore coastal ecosystems, as attested by
   historical literature sources. Further, we reveal that BFT which
   migrated to the Black Sea-and that disappeared during a period of
   intense exploitation and ecosystem changes in the 1980s-represented a
   unique component, isotopically distinct from BFT of NE Atlantic and
   Mediterranean locations. These data suggest that anthropogenic
   activities had the ability to alter the diet and habitat use of fishes
   in conditions prior to those of recent decades. Consequently, long-term
   data provide novel perspectives on when marine ecosystem modification
   began and the responses of marine populations, with which to guide

   phase assessed using stable isotopes",ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,2011,93,2,87-97,JUN 10,"The St. Lucia Estuary is Africa's largest estuarine system and is
   currently experiencing the stress of prolonged freshwater deprivation,
   manifested by extremely low water levels and hypersalinity. These
   unprecedented conditions have raised questions regarding the trophic
   functioning of the ecosystem. Despite the substantial amount of research
   previously undertaken within this system, no studies of food web
   structure and function have yet been documented. This study therefore
   aimed to examine the food web structure of the St. Lucia estuary system
   through the use of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis. Analysis
   of carbon isotope ratios indicates that benthic carbon sources are most
   utilised at sites with low water levels and generally higher salinity
   (Catalina Bay, Charter's Creek). Conversely, the estuarine region of the
   mouth and Narrows, with its elevated water levels and lower salinity,
   still sustains a viable pelagic food web. Analysis of delta N-15 ratios
   indicates that the number of trophic transfers (food chain length) might
   be related to water levels. Overall, the study provides a greater
   understanding of the ecological processes of this complex estuarine
   lake, which may allow for future comparisons of trophic functioning
   under drought and normal/wet conditions to be made. (C) 2011 Published

   functioning of ecosystems and can be used to identify qualitative
   differences among ecosystems. Here, we use natural stable isotope
   concentrations (delta C-13 and delta N-15) to study the food-web
   structure in four contrasting locations on the northern European
   continental shelf: two sub-Arctic locations in the Lofoten-Vesteralen
   region (fjord vs. open shelf) and two temperate locations (northern vs.
   southern North Sea). Phytoplankton was identified as the major primary
   producer in all studied ecosystems, even in the sub-Arctic fjord, where
   macroalgae only played a minor role in the food web. We used mixing
   models to determine the relative reliance on prey of benthic affinity
   and found that reliance on benthic prey was higher in the North Sea than
   in the Lofoten-Vesteralen region. Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) was
   identified as the single top-predator in the North Sea, utilizing food
   from both benthic and pelagic trophic channels. More separate benthic
   and pelagic trophic channels characterize the Lofoten-Vesteralen region,
   where G. morhua acts as part of the pelagic food chain. Furthermore, our
   data indicate that the recent mesopredator outburst in the southern
   North Sea might have been enhanced by reduced predation pressure due to
   the collapse of the local cod stocks. We conclude that the resilience
   toward a high fishing pressure is higher in the Lofoten-Vesteralen

   northern Canada can facilitate movement of fishes into aquatic
   ecosystems from which they were previously absent. Successful
   colonization would change fish community structure and potentially alter
   food web dynamics. We compared the trophic ecology, growth, and body
   condition of Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in small, tundra lakes
   that varied in fish community structure to help understand effects of
   colonization on this key species. Complementary stable isotope and
   stomach content analyses indicated that Lake Trout foraging differs
   between lakes with and without multiple large-bodied fishes. In lakes
   with a single potential competitor, trout consumed primarily pelagic
   zooplankton, but focused on more littoral resources in the presence of
   multiple large-bodied fishes. Population trophic niche width and
   inter-individual variation in Lake Trout diet were larger in lakes with
   multiple competitors, whereas Lake Trout populations in lakes with only
   one other large-bodied species were in better body condition. Our
   findings highlight the potential sensitivity of northern Lake Trout
   populations to colonizing fish species. (C) 2015 International

   web-assimilated carbon and nitrogen resources to a century of
   environmental change",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,2021,27,11,2328-2342,JUN,"Anthropogenic climate change will impact nutrient cycles, primary
   production, and ecosystem structure in the world's oceans, although
   considerable uncertainty exists regarding the magnitude and spatial
   variability of these changes. Understanding how regional-scale ocean
   conditions control nutrient availability and ultimately nutrient
   assimilation into food webs will inform how marine resources will change
   in response to climate. To evaluate how ocean conditions influence the
   assimilation of nitrogen and carbon into coastal marine food webs, we
   applied a novel dimension reduction analysis to a century of newly
   acquired molecular isotope data derived from historic harbor seal bone
   specimens. By measuring bulk delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of source
   amino acids of these top predators from 1928 to 2014, we derive indices
   of primary production and nitrogen resources that are assimilated into
   food webs. We determined coastal food webs responded to climate regimes,
   coastal upwelling, and freshwater discharge, yet the strength of
   responses to individual drivers varied across the northeast Pacific.
   Indices of primary production and nitrogen availability in the Gulf of
   Alaska were dependent on regional climate indices (i.e., North Pacific
   Gyre Oscillation) and upwelling. In contrast, the coastal Washington and
   Salish Sea food webs were associated with local indices of freshwater
   discharge. For some regions (eastern Bering Sea, northern Gulf of
   Alaska) food web-assimilated production was coupled with nitrogen
   sources; however, other regions demonstrated no production-nitrogen
   coupling (Salish Sea). Temporal patterns of environmental indices and
   isotopic data from Washington state varied about the long-term mean with
   no directional trend. Data from the Gulf of Alaska, however, showed
   below average harbor seal delta C-13 values and above average ocean
   conditions since 1975, indicating a change in primary production in
   recent decades. Altogether, these findings demonstrate stable isotope
   data can provide useful indices of nitrogen resources and phytoplankton

   for risk assessment. The red king crab Paralithodes camtschaticus is
   both a valuable fishery resource and a potential threat to native biota
   in the Barents Sea. We combined gut content analysis and stable carbon
   and nitrogen isotope analysis to study feeding strategy, variation in
   resource use and niche overlap within the benthic food web of
   Porsangerfjord (70.1 degrees to 70.9 degrees N, 25 degrees to 26.5
   degrees E) on the northern Norwegian coast. This fjord has experienced
   recent invasion by the red king crab. Sediment-dwelling bivalves and
   polychaetes dominated gut contents of the red king crab with respect to
   occurrence, and the wide range of prey from multiple trophic levels
   revealed a generalist, opportunistic feeding strategy. There were
   differences in diet related to crab size and foraging location,
   reflecting habitat choice and depth distribution of crabs during their
   life cycle. Small crabs, feeding in shallow water, relied to a larger
   extent on littoral species such as sea urchins and gastropods. The
   estimated mean trophic level for red king crab in Porsangerfjord was 3.1
   (range 2.7-3.5). There was no evidence of a pronounced ontogenetic niche
   shift in stable isotopes, with local effects concealing possible overall
   size effects. Competition may arise with native anomuran species (e.g.
   Lithodes maja), large predatory asteroids and gastropods, all of which
   overlapped with red king crab in isotopic niche. A low overlap in
   isotopic niche between red king crab and fish suggests that they exploit
   different major food resources and that predatory fish occupy a higher

   ecosystem dysfunction in the past decades. Multifactorial kelp threats
   have been described and include deforestation due to human impact,
   cascading effects and climate change. Here, we compared community and
   trophic structure in two contrasting kelp forests off the coasts of
   Brittany. One has been harvested five years before sampling and shelters
   abundant omnivorous predators, almost absent from the other, which has
   been treated as preserved from kelp harvest. delta N-15 analyses
   conducted on the overall communities were linked to the
   tropho-functional structure of different strata featuring these forests
   (stipe and holdfast of canopy kelp and rock). Our results yielded
   site-to-site differences of community and tropho-functional structures
   across kelp strata, particularly contrasting in terms of biomass on the
   understorey. Similarly, isotope analyses inferred the top trophic
   position of Marthasterias glacialis and Echinus esculentus which may be
   considered as strong interactors in the sub-canopy. We interrogate these
   patterns and propose a series of probable and testable alternative
   hypotheses to explain them. For instance, we propose that differences of
   trophic structure and functioning result from confounded effects of
   contrasting wave dissipation depending on kelp size-density structure
   and community cascading involving these omnivorous predators. Given the
   species diversity and complexity of food web highlighted in these
   habitats, we call for further comprehensive research about the overall
   strata and tropho-functional groups for conservation management in kelp
   forests. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Leclerc, JC (Corresponding Author), Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Stn Biol Roscoff, Pl Georges Teissier, F-29680 Roscoff, France.

   determinants of ecosystem functions and services. However, there is
   little information on the effect of eutrophication on food source
   contributions and food web structure in seagrass meadows. Here we used
   stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen (delta C-13 and delta N-15) to
   investigate how do different levels of nutrient enrichment affect the
   diets of consumers and food web structure within tropical seagrass
   meadows. We found that the diet contributions of macroalgae (mean 24\%
   +/- 12\% for fish, 21\% +/- 5\% for invertebrates), particulate organic
   matter (mean 19\% +/- 12\% for fish, 18\% +/- 8\% for invertebrates),
   and sediment organic matter (mean 24\% +/- 13\% for fish, 21\% +/- 8\%
   for invertebrates) to fish and invertebrates were all higher in seagrass
   meadows with higher nutrient concentrations, while seagrass and
   epiphytes contributed more to consumers in seagrass meadows with lower
   nutrient concentrations. Meanwhile, higher nutrient concentrations
   decreased the trophic position (mean 2.6 +/- 0.5 in high-nutrient level,
   3.4 +/- 0.6 in low-nutrients level) of consumers and food chain length
   (2.5 in high-nutrient level, 2.9 in low-nutrients level). Higher
   nutrient concentrations reduced the contribution of seagrass carbon to
   consumers through the grazing food chain, but enhanced the flow of
   macroalgal carbon to consumers through the grazing food chain. Overall,
   eutrophication modified the food web structure of seagrass meadows. We
   recommend that measures be taken to decrease nutrient input into
   seagrass ecosystems to maintain its important functions and services.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Huang, XP (Corresponding Author), Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Trop Marine Bioresources \& Ecol, Guangzhou 510301, Peoples R China.

   food resources driving food webs in commercial rice agroecosystems and
   to examine the effects of agricultural management practices on the
   trophic structure of these food webs. Potential carbon sources and
   aquatic macroinvertebrate consumers were collected from large-scale rice
   farms in south-eastern Australia cultivated under three different crop
   management regimes conventional-aerial (agrochemicals applied, aerially
   sown), conventional-sod (agrochemicals applied, directly sown) and
   organic-sod (agrochemical-free, directly sown). Evidence from stable
   isotope analysis demonstrated the importance of food sources, such as
   biofilm and detritus, as the principal energy sources driving aquatic
   food webs in rice agroecosystems. Despite the greater diversity of
   potential food sources collected from the organic-sod regime across all
   sampling occasions, the range of food resources directly assimilated by
   macroinvertebrate consumers did not differ substantially across
   management regimes. Trophic complexity of aquatic food webs, as
   evidenced by the number of trophic levels identified using delta N-15
   data, differed across management regimes at the early season sampling.
   Sites with low or no agrochemical applications contained more than two
   trophic levels, but at the site with the highest pesticide application
   no primary or secondary consumers were found. Our data demonstrates that
   the choice of agricultural management regime has a season-long influence

   conserving non-rice food resources that drive these trophic networks.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Wilson, AL (Corresponding Author), Charles Sturt Univ, Johnstone Ctr, Locked Bag 588, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia.

   webs in an Arctic marine ecosystem",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,2022,841,NA,NA,OCT 1,"Mercury (Hg) is a ubiquitous toxic metal that biomagnifies in food webs,
   and can reach high concentrations in top predators. Evaluating Hg
   biomagnification in Arctic marine food webs is critical for
   understanding Hg dynamics and estimating exposure to understudied fish
   and wildlife consumed by humans. The majority of studies conducted on Hg
   biomagnification in the Arctic have focused on pelagic food webs.
   Benthic and benthopelagic food webs in Arc-tic marine ecosystems also
   support many species of subsistence and commercial importance, and data
   are lacking for these systems. In this study, we investigated food web
   structure and Hg biomagnification for the benthic, pelagic, and
   benthopelagic marine food webs of inner Frobisher Bay in Nunavut. Stable
   isotope ratios of carbon (813C) and nitrogen (815N), as well as total
   (THg) and methyl (MeHg) mercury concentrations were measured in fish,
   invertebrates, and zooplankton. Biomagnification in each food web was
   quantified with Trophic Magnification Slopes (TMS) and Trophic
   Magnification Factors (TMF). The highest TMS and TMF values were
   exhibited by the benthopelagic food web (TMS = 0.201; TMF = 1.59),
   followed by the pelagic food web (TMS = 0.183; TMF = 1.52), and lastly
   the benthic food web (TMS = 0.079; TMF = 1.20), with 815N explaining
   88\%, 79\%, and 9\% of variation in Hg concentrations, respectively. TMS
   and TMF values were generally low compared to other Arctic marine food
   webs. Results from food web structure analyses indicated that the
   benthic food web had the greatest trophic diversity, trophic redundancy,
   and largest isoto-pic niche area of all food webs studied. Greater food
   web complexity may thus result in reduced MeHg biomagnification, but
   further study is required. Acquiring Hg and food web structure data is
   critical for predicting the effects of climate-induced environmental
   change on Hg dynamics, especially in the context of Arctic marine
   eco-systems.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Hilgendag, IR (Corresponding Author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Biol, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.

   lake food webs highlighted by stable isotope analysis",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2018,63,9,1130-1142,SEP,"Non-native freshwater fish species can have adverse ecological impacts
   on native populations. However, the mechanisms determining the success
   or otherwise of their invasion and their role in invaded communities
   remain largely unknown. This is particularly true for the Mediterranean
   region, where endemic species characterised by restricted natural ranges
   may be at high risk of extinction. The largemouth bass (Micropterus
   salmoides) is native to North America but is invasive in the Italian
   Peninsula. The aim of this study was to explore the trophic position of
   M.salmoides, its diet and niche overlap with native fish species in the
   littoral areas of a Mediterranean lake. Our study was supported by
   analysis of stable C and N isotopes in the tissues of fish and their
   potential food sources, twenty years after the introduction of the
   largemouth bass to Lake Bracciano (Italy). Samples were collected in
   locations varying in terms of physical structure and resource
   availability at lower trophic levels in the food web, which was greater
   in the southern (hereafter: South) than in the northern (hereafter:
   North) area of the lake. These differences made it possible to explore
   the mechanisms linking environmental conditions and the role of alien
   predators in the invaded food web. The abundance of M.salmoides was
   higher, and the diversity of native fish species was lower, in North
   than South. In North, M.salmoides had a piscivorous diet and occupied a
   higher trophic position in the food web than in South, where
   invertebrates constituted an important part of its diet. As a
   consequence, trophic niche interference with other fish species at
   intermediate trophic levels was higher in South. In contrast, in North,
   M.salmoides showed stronger trophic interference with the percid Perca
   fluviatilis, a native top predator in the food web, but weaker
   interference with remaining fish species. Our results help to understand
   the role of alien species in the food webs of Lake Bracciano, which
   primarily depends on the habitat and the availability of prey across
   trophic levels. Physical and ecological variations in the habitat were
   associated with differences in predatory interactions among native and
   alien fish species. This suggests that a reduction in productivity and
   biodiversity at lower trophic levels in lake food webs may favour the
   success of opportunistic invasive fish species, given the ability of the
   invaders to maintain some of their characteristics silent, and to fully
   express their genotype under favourable environmental conditions.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Calizza, E (Corresponding Author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Environm Biol, Rome, Italy.

   alter trophic ecology in aquatic ecosystems, there has been limited
   research on how invasive species alter methylmercury (MeHg)
   biomagnification in lacustrine food webs. We sampled surface water and
   biota from 8 lakes in Quebec, Canada, spanning a range of dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (2.9-8.4 mg/L); 4 lakes were
   inhabited by native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and the
   remaining lakes contained brook trout and a non-native fish, Allegheny
   pearl dace (Margariscus margarita). Periphyton, zooplankton,
   macroinvertebrates, and fish were analyzed for: 1) stable carbon (delta
   C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope ratios to delineate food webs,
   and 2) total Hg (THg) or MeHg. Compared with the brook trout from
   reference lakes, fish from invaded lakes had higher length-standardized
   THg concentrations as well as a narrower dietary range and elevated
   trophic level, inferred from unadjusted delta C-13 and delta N-15
   values, respectively. The rate of Hg biomagnification was similar across
   invaded and reference lakes, implying little effect of the invasive fish
   on the trophic transfer of MeHg. Despite differences in food web
   structure due to pearl dace invasion, DOC was the strongest predictor of
   brook trout THg levels for all lakes, suggesting that underlying
   environmental factors exerted a stronger influence on brook trout THg

   north temperate lakes",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,2004,14,1,132-148,FEB,"Smallmouth bass and other warmwater littoral piscivores are presently
   expanding their geographic range northward into lakes across southern
   Canada. Smallmouth bass introduction can dramatically reduce minnow
   abundances, causing native lake trout to shift to low quality,
   invertebrate-based diets. Here we develop models to predict future
   occurrences and impacts of smallmouth bass in central Ontario, with the
   goal of identifying ``vulnerable{''} lakes in order to better guide
   prevention efforts. Using local and regional environmental variables for
   3046 central Ontario lakes, an artificial neural network was used to
   predict lakes that are likely to be invaded by bass. Smallmouth bass can
   significantly influence the occurrence and abundance of small-bodied
   fishes (mainly minnows), and stable isotope analysis of food webs in 18
   lakes revealed that lake trout are buffered from impacts of bass on
   minnows in lakes containing pelagic prey fishes. In the absence of
   pelagic prey fishes, the trophic niche of lake trout depends on the
   presence of bass; lake trout feed primarily on zooplankton in the
   presence of bass, and minnows in the absence of bass. Of the 3046 lakes,

   of a boreal river",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,2019,35,9,1575-1589,NOV,"Long-term monitoring of the food web of a regulated hydropeaking river
   was conducted to assess if previously documented effects of changing
   ramping rates (RRs) were maintained with the addition of 6 years of
   data. Using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses, we hypothesized
   that: (1) macroinvertebrates and fish inhabiting areas below peaking
   hydrodams would be higher in delta N-15 and lower in delta C-13 due to
   increased flow velocity and the influence of light respired dissolved
   inorganic carbon, relative to those sampled from areas with a natural
   flow regime; (2) the increase in delta N-15 of macroinvertebrates would
   lead a shorter food web length in the regulated river, but delta C-13
   and niche width would be similar between the restricted and unrestricted
   RR periods (i.e., the BACI analysis); and (3) isotopic metrics (e.g.,
   delta C-13, delta N-15, niche width {[}SEA(B)], and food chain length
   {[}Delta N-15]) would correlate with variations in flow characteristics
   through time. Consistent with previous analysis conducted over a shorter
   time period, a shift toward higher delta N-15 values was observed for
   both fish and invertebrates, but, contrarily, only invertebrates (not
   fish) had a lower delta C-13 value downstream of the dam. Over the long
   term, the before-after-control-impact analysis found no effect of RRs on
   any of the food web metrics, implying that the change in operation did
   not affect the river food web. However, analysis of the time series data
   indicated that flow metrics and trophic metrics were often correlated,
   including a negative effect of RR (invertebrates) and discharge (fish)
   on food chain length. This study illustrates the difficulty in detecting
   changes in food web structure and function under changing flow regime
   influenced by natural and anthropogenic effects. As such, this study
   highlights the need for considering large spatial and temporal scales to
   differentiate between confounding effects of climate, natural
   variability, and altered flow regimes on food webs in regulated rivers.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Smokorowski, KE (Corresponding Author), Fisheries \& Oceans Canada, Great Lakes Lab Fisheries \& Aquat Sci, 1219 Queen St East, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2E5, Canada.

Article,Jose Luis Jimenez-Seinos and Javier Alcocer and Dolors Planas,"Food web differences between two neighboring tropical high mountain
   lakes and the influence of introducing a new top predator",PLOS ONE,2023,18,6,NA,JUN 13,"High mountain lakes (HMLs) are considered unique and comparable
   ecosystems for monitoring global climate change. The food web structure
   can indicate the response of these ecosystems to ecological threats,
   such as fish introduction, by analyzing the trophic dynamics.
   Nonetheless, the food webs of tropical HMLs are less well-studied than
   temperate HMLs. The present study assessed the food webs of two
   neighboring (600 m apart) tropical HMLs, El Sol and La Luna, inside the
   crater of the Nevado de Toluca volcano, Mexico. It used stable isotopes
   (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and Bayesian mixing models with different
   trophic discrimination factors and priors to assess the impacts of
   introduced rainbow trout, persisting only in the larger lake, El Sol.
   The food web in Lake El Sol was more complex than in Lake La Luna,
   mainly due to its larger size, extensive vegetated littoral zone, and
   being fueled by autochthonous primary production. In contrast, the
   smaller and fishless Lake La Luna has a reduced and bare littoral zone
   that harbored a simple food web substantially sustained by allochthonous
   carbon inputs. The persistence of introduced rainbow trout in Lake El
   Sol but not in Lake La Luna accentuated the differences between the
   lakes. The models suggested that rainbow trout fed on key consumers of
   littoral macroinvertebrates (70-80\%) and pelagic zooplankton (20-30\%),
   increasing the linkage between sub-networks. In both tropical HMLs, the
   species richness and herbivorous fraction were elevated compared with
   temperate HMLs, while the linkage density and omnivorous fraction were
   lower. Basal nodes dominated these tropical HMLs, and the vegetated
   littoral zone of Lake El Sol had more intermediate (omnivore) nodes. Our
   results showed the convenience of food web analysis to compare the
   effects of introduced fish in originally fishless lakes in different

   questions raised could be answered using these chemical markers.
   Representative research papers (16) focused on the use of stable

   D,206Pb/207Pb, and 208Pb/207Pb) to evaluate the effect of anthropogenic

   and urban development) on mangrove food webs were selected. Each article
   included at least one group of consumers (invertebrate or fish).
   Publications only focused on water quality or primary producers were not
   included. Most studies managed to determine the effect of the

   1758) and food web structure of the upper Niagara River were examined.
   Stable isotope analysis (SIA) of liver tissue was used to test the
   hypothesis that rudds shifted their diets from piscivory during early
   spring months when macrophyte availability was low towards herbivory
   when macrophytes were abundant and warmer water temperatures facilitated
   digestion. Muscle tissue was used to evaluate the trophic position of
   rudds and other invasive species relative to native species. SIA
   revealed enriched delta N-15 and depleted delta C-13 in liver tissue of
   rudds during early spring months, suggesting a mostly piscivorous diet
   of pelagic origin when macrophyte availability was low, and depressed
   delta N-15 and elevated delta C-13 values during warmer summer months
   when littoral macrophytes were abundant. Analysis of muscle tissue from
   late summer indicated that rudds and other invasive fishes, including
   common carp Cyprinus carpio (Linnaeus, 1758) and goldfish Carassius
   auratus (Linnaeus, 1758), had similar trophic positions that may be
   attributed to their omnivorous feeding strategies. The ability of rudds
   to shift their diets from feeding on fishes of pelagic origin towards
   consuming littoral macrophytes is an adaptation that is likely to both
   facilitate invasion and create novel pathways of nutrient transfer among
   habitat types. Our results provide an increased understanding of the

   been underestimated by several-fold owing to application of an
   inappropriate length-weight regression model. During August and
   September the underestimates can exceed three-fold, suggesting that
   secondary production of the species in the lake is greater than
   previously thought. Increased representation of the species in the
   plankton community in recent years is associated with a decrease in its
   trophic level deduced through nitrogen stable isotope analysis of
   specimens from opportunistic samples obtained in 1993, 1995, and 2009.
   Limnocalanus N-15 enrichment relative to primary herbivores appears to
   have decreased by 1.5\%. over this time period. Similarly, Diaptomus
   N-15 enrichment relative to primary herbivores appeared to decrease by
   1.1\%. from 1993 to 2009. Our data offer at least two possible
   explanations for this shift. (I) Limnocalanus has adopted a more
   herbivorous diet in response to the ecological changes in Lake Huron or
   (2) hypolimnetic Diaptomus have adopted a more herbivorous diet and
   Limnocalanus is relying in part on Diaptomus as a food source. (C) 2013

   niche specialization in an opportunistic stream predator",JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,2014,83,5,1025-1034,SEP,"1. Many generalist populations are composed of specialized individuals
   that use a narrow part of the population's niche. Ecological theories
   predict that individual specialization and population trophic niche are
   determined by biotic interactions and resource diversity emerging from
   environmental variations (i. e. ecological opportunities). However, due
   to the paucity of empirical and experimental demonstrations, the genuine
   importance of each of these drivers in determining trophic niche
   attributes is not fully appreciated.
   2. The present study aimed at determining the population level and
   individual responses of brown trout (Salmo trutta) to variations in
   ecological opportunities (terrestrial prey inputs) and autochthonous
   prey communities among 10 stream reaches along a riparian condition
   gradient using individual longitudinal monitoring and stable isotope
   analyses.
   3. Our results suggested that trophic niche diversity varied along the
   environmental gradient, while individual trophic specialization was
   indirectly driven by ecological opportunities through strengthened
   intraspecific competition. Individual diet was repeatable over the study
   period, and the growth rate of juvenile brown trout increased with their
   specialization for aquatic predatory invertebrates.
   4. Our findings highlight the dual influences of intraspecific
   competition and ecological opportunities on individual trophic
   specialization and population trophic niche.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Cucherousset, J (Corresponding Author), Univ Toulouse 3, Lab Evolut \& Divers Biol, CNRS, ENFA,UMR5174,EDB, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse, France.

   ecology in a changing Arctic marine ecosystem",OECOLOGIA,2016,180,3,631-644,MAR,"Spatial and temporal variation can confound interpretations of
   relationships within and between species in terms of diet composition,
   niche size, and trophic position (TP). The cause of dietary variation
   within species is commonly an ontogenetic niche shift, which is a key
   dynamic influencing community structure. We quantified spatial and
   temporal variations in ringed seal (Pusa hispida) diet, niche size, and
   TP during ontogeny across the Arctic-a rapidly changing ecosystem.
   Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis was performed on 558 liver
   and 630 muscle samples from ringed seals and on likely prey species from
   five locations ranging from the High to the Low Arctic. A modest
   ontogenetic diet shift occurred, with adult ringed seals consuming more
   forage fish (approximately 80 versus 60 \%) and having a higher TP than
   subadults, which generally decreased with latitude. However, the degree
   of shift varied spatially, with adults in the High Arctic presenting a
   more restricted niche size and consuming more Arctic cod (Boreogadus
   saida) than subadults (87 versus 44 \%) and adults at the lowest
   latitude (29 \%). The TPs of adult and subadult ringed seals generally
   decreased with latitude (4.7-3.3), which was mainly driven by greater
   complexity in trophic structure within the zooplankton communities.
   Adult isotopic niche size increased over time, likely due to the recent
   circumpolar increases in subarctic forage fish distribution and
   abundance. Given the spatial and temporal variability in ringed seal
   foraging ecology, ringed seals exhibit dietary plasticity as a species,
   suggesting adaptability in terms of their diet to climate change.",SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",Article,English,"Yurkowski, DJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.

   native bush (mainly tree leaves and dicotyledonous seeds) and exotic
   pasture settings (mainly grass stems and monocotyledonous seeds) were
   dominated by allochthonous material. More detritus occurred in stomachs
   in autumn-winter than in spring-summer, but quantities were similar in
   crayfish from native bush and pasture streams. The stomachs of larger
   crayfish contained a significantly greater proportion of detritus than
   smaller individuals. Aquatic invertebrates were the second most abundant
   dietary category by volume, with highest values in winter, but there
   were no significant differences between land uses or crayfish size
   classes. A wide range of invertebrates was eaten by crayfish, with
   mayfly nymphs, chironomid larvae, and snails predominating. The latter
   were numerically more prominent in crayfish from bush than pasture
   streams. Terrestrial invertebrates were recorded from 4\% of stomachs,
   but there were no significant differences in relation to land use,
   season, or crayfish size class. Despite aquatic invertebrates making up
   <4\% of stomach volumes on average, stable isotope analysis indicated a
   greater importance for invertebrate prey in terms of assimilation and
   incorporation into crayfish biomass. Allochthonous detritus and moss
   appeared to be unimportant. Whereas the results of stomach analysis
   provided some evidence of an ontogenetic shift, with detritus assuming
   greater importance in larger crayfish, this pattern was not supported by
   isotope analysis because invertebrate prey appeared more important to
   the diet than detritus. An unidentified carbon source, depleted in (13)C

   functioning of a highly dynamic marine environment",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,2016,477,NA,92-102,APR,"Carbon flow through ecosystems is determined by the nature, availability
   and incorporation of basal resources (BRs) to higher trophic levels of
   food webs. The occurrence of abundant supplementary BR often diversifies
   trophic niches within food webs. Blooms of opportunistic macroalgae,
   which may act as additional BRs, have increased in intensity, and are
   expected to amplify further because of global change. Understanding the
   effects of high biomasses of opportunistic BRs on the functioning of
   naturally unvegetated coastal ecosystems is thus crucial. We set out to
   assess whether and how green algae (opportunistic BR) modifies
   macrotidal sandy beach trophic structure and functioning. We also
   investigated whether these effects propagate up through the web, looking
   at different scales and trophic levels (i.e. primary producers, specific
   primary consumers, and the general higher-consumer assemblage). To
   achieve these objectives, we used a high-resolution field sampling (over
   1200 individual stable isotope-, and 180 biodiversity samples) at
   pristine and macroalgal-bloom-affected macrotidal sandy beaches,
   together with recent and novel analytical approaches (biomass-weighted
   isotope signatures, Isotopic Functional Indices). We found that the
   opportunistic BR, both directly and indirectly affects the entire beach
   food web across several trophic levels, by inducing shifts in trophic
   interactions. Overall, we found that the dominance of a BR in the form
   of opportunistic algae simplifies the entire food web over time. Our
   findings challenge the paradigm that addition of BR inherently
   diversifies trophic interactions within an ecosystem, and have
   implications for the interpretation of shifts in dynamic system food
   webs and eutrophicated environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   to better understand mechanisms promoting flexibility and resilience of
   ecosystem components to such change to inform strategies for
   conservation. Glacial relict species are especially vulnerable to such
   changes. We investigated the behavioural responses of a native, glacial
   relict species, Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) to long-term
   environmental changes. It was hypothesised that changes in feeding
   behaviour would occur as a key intermediary to reduction in habitat
   availability (through climate change and eutrophication) or competitive
   interactions {[}with introduced roach (Rutilus rutilus)]. Stomach
   content analysis was used to assess the diet of 199 charr caught from
   Windermere, United Kingdom, in the months of March, June, September and
   November 2003-2007. The results were compared to data from 1940 to 1951
   prior to the environmental changes and revealed a marked increase in the
   contribution of benthic invertebrates in the present diet. Stable
   isotope analysis confirms the results of the stomach analysis,
   suggesting that the charr have switched their diet from zooplanktivory
   towards benthivory. We discuss the possibility that habitat modification
   and roach population expansion in Windermere have contributed to changes
   in charr diet. Complementary studies suggest that this diet shift is
   more likely to be a response to the increasing roach population than to
   habitat modification; however, further study in Windermere would be
   required to elucidate the exact mechanism. Long-term data sets such as
   these provide information that is useful for determining the directivity
   of ecological change and the capability of species to respond to change.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Corrigan, LJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Durham, Sch Biol \& Biomed Sci, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England.

   habitats that serve as biodiversity hotspots and provide valuable

   different primary producers and is an important ocean-land transition

   carbon sources determine the structure of the food web. In order to
   determine the contribution of basal carbon sources and the food web
   structure of the littoral zone, we used carbon and nitrogen stable
   isotope techniques and a Bayesian mixing model to study the autumn
   benthic food web in the sea adjacent to the Miaodao Archipelago. The
   potential carbon sources of the benthic food web biota in the sea
   adjacent to the Miaodao Archipelago in autumn are mainly algae
   (including phytoplankton and macroalgae) and SOM, but the contribution
   of POM is low. Macroalgae may play a more important role in the littoral
   zone benthic food webs. Although there are certain uncertainties in the
   model results, invertebrates and fish have obvious differences in their

   fish",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,2019,511,NA,60-67,FEB,"Rapid environmental changes occurring in the Arctic nearshore are
   expected to have significant effects on food web structures. Land-fast
   ice cover limits the effectiveness of monitoring methods during winter
   months, precluding understanding of how seasonal Arctic nearshore food
   webs operate. Tissue-dependent stable isotope analysis (SIA) offers an
   efficient and cost-effective approach to monitoring changes in food webs
   during ice-covered months but requires controlled laboratory experiments
   to determine isotopic turnover rates and trophic discrimination factors
   (TDFs) of different tissues. We propose that Arctic Sculpin
   (Myoxocephalus scorpioides) be used to investigate Arctic nearshore
   trophodynamics given its opportunistic feeding habits and consistent
   residence within nearshore Arctic habitats. We present the first
   tissue-dependent SIA experiment on an Arctic marine fish species and
   show that delta N-15 values of fin (or liver) and muscle of Arctic
   Sculpin may be used to identify shifts in low-trophic-level resource
   availability between 56 and 122 days before sacrifice. Furthermore, TDFs
   were determined for carbon isotopes (1.87 parts per thousand), but
   results for nitrogen (1.23 parts per thousand to 3.23 parts per
   thousand) suggest that TDFs in Arctic fish may be highly dependent on
   lipid content of their diet. We observed similar turnover rates between
   liver and fin tissues (56 and 58 days, respectively), and suggest it may
   not be necessary to sample both, making it possible to use Arctic
   Sculpin for tissue dependent analyses with potentially non-lethal
   sampling of fin and muscle tissues. The use of Arctic Sculpin as an
   indicator species can increase the understanding of food web structure
   and aid in monitoring changes to lower-trophic level prey availability

   watershed size",ECOSPHERE,2011,2,7,NA,JUL,"Consumers in aquatic food webs can be supported by terrestrial and
   aquatic primary production. However, we know little about how
   allochthony, i.e., the proportion of consumer biomass derived from
   terrestrial organic matter, varies along environmental gradients. Using
   hydrogen isotopes (deuterium), we quantified allochthony of an
   ecologically dominant detritivorous fish species (gizzard shad, Dorosoma
   cepedianum) in reservoir ecosystems, along a gradient of watershed land
   use (agriculture vs. forest). We predicted that allochthony would
   decline with an increase in the proportion of watershed land composed of
   agriculture (\% agriculture). This is based on the supposition that as
   \% agriculture increases, so does the export of dissolved inorganic
   nutrients to lakes, stimulating algal production and reducing the
   importance of terrestrial organic carbon subsidies. Allochthony
   accounted for similar to 34\% of gizzard shad production (mean of 11
   lakes), although this fraction varied greatly (0-68\%) among lakes and
   isotope mixing model assumptions. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found
   no relationship between allochthony and \% agriculture. However,
   allochthony was inversely related to total watershed area, as well as
   the absolute area of the watershed (rather than the percentage) composed
   of agriculture. We speculate that watershed area and allochthony are
   negatively correlated because watershed area exerts a strong control on
   the relative subsidies of dissolved inorganic nutrients vs. particulate
   organic carbon. Gizzard shad biomass was positively related to
   phytoplankton primary production but negatively related to allochthony,
   suggesting that phytodetritus is a higher quality resource than
   terrestrial detritus. Overall, our results show that both autochthonous
   and allochthonous carbon fuel the production of this ecologically
   important detritivore, the relative importance of allochthony decreases
   with increasing watershed size, and variation in gizzard shad production
   is closely tied to variation in autochthonous primary production.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Babler, AL (Corresponding Author), St Marys Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Winona, MN 55997 USA.

   stable CNS isotopes: State of the art, knowledge gaps, and
   community-scale perspectives",ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,2015,156,SI,195-204,APR 5,"In recent decades, the analysis of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur stable
   isotopes (SIA) has emerged as a powerful, viable methodology for
   examining food web structure and dynamics, as well as addressing a
   number of applied issues. Here, we provide a state-of-the-art review of
   the use of SIA for assessing anthropogenic pressures on natural
   ecosystems, in order to establish current knowledge gaps and identify
   promising applications for evaluating the ecological status of marine
   coastal waters. Specifically, the potential of SIA to provide food
   web-scale indicators for estimating cumulative anthropogenic pressures
   is addressed. The review indicates that the methodology has been used
   for virtually the whole spectrum of human pressures known to influence
   marine ecosystems. However, only the effects of chemical pollution,
   release of dissolved and particulate nutrients, and invasive species
   have been extensively investigated. For the first two pressures,
   substantial efforts have been made to implement isotopic quantitative
   approaches and metrics for inter-system comparisons; however, with the
   exception of nutrient release, the majority of aquatic studies have been
   carried out in freshwater systems, and only limited information is
   available on marine environments. In particular, the effects of invasive
   species on coastal habitats have received scant attention. Trophic
   position of indicator species emerges as the isotopic metric most
   ubiquitously adopted for measuring the impact of anthropogenic
   pressures. Conversely, the application of other recently implemented
   metrics, proven to be highly effective in integrating information on the
   spatial-temporal dynamics of aquatic food webs, is to date still
   limited. The potential of stable isotope analysis to provide a unifying
   methodological-theoretical framework for effective, inter-ecosystem
   comparisons of both single and multiple anthropogenic pressures is
   emphasised. Additionally, a plea for the implementation and
   intercalibration of community-scale isotopic metrics is made, in order
   to provide useful tools and indicators for current and future
   environmental legislative initiatives. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   to estimate the FCL of fish in different reaches of the main stream in

   The results showed that FCL varied widely among the studied areas with a

   river sections in the upstream of the dam was greater than that in the
   downstream. Regression analysis and model selection results revealed
   that the FCL had a significant positive correlation with ecosystem size
   as well as resource availability, and FCL variation was largely
   explained by ecosystem size, which represented 72\% of the model weight.
   In summary, our results suggested that ecosystem size plays a key role

   subject to discarding activity using stable isotopes",PLOS ONE,2022,17,6,NA,NA,"Discarding practices have become a source of concern for the perennation
   of marine resources, prompting efforts of discard reduction around the
   globe. However, little is known about the fate of discards in marine
   environments. Discarding may provide food for various marine consumers,
   potentially affecting food web structure and stability. Yet, quantifying
   reliance upon discards is difficult because identity and frequency of
   discards may change according to multiple factors, and most previously
   used diet assessment techniques do not allow to assume consistency of
   feeding strategies over time. One currently untested hypothesis is that
   significant contribution of discards over time should reflect in
   increased trophic level (TL) of marine fauna, particularly in low TL
   consumers. Here, we explored this hypothesis by modeling the TL and
   assimilated diet of consumers living in fishing grounds subject to
   important discarding activity using stable isotope analysis. We found
   indications that benthic invertebrates and Chondrichthyes may depict a
   higher than expected TL, while other fish tend to depict similar to
   lower TL compared to global averages from the literature. Based on prior
   knowledge of discard consumption in the same area, stable isotope mixing
   models congruently revealed that discards may represent substantial
   portions of the assimilated diet of most benthic invertebrate
   macrofauna, cephalopods and Chondrichthyes. We highlight limitations and
   challenges of currently used diet assessment techniques to study discard
   consumption and stress that understanding their reintegration in marine
   food webs is crucial in the context of an ecosystem approach to
   fisheries management and to better understand the functioning of marine

   species are shifting their ranges to colder regions, which may lead to
   altered community composition, but it remains largely unknown how it
   will affect ecosystem functioning. Here, stable isotope analysis was
   used to study benthic OM utilization and food-web structure and to
   assess whether their spatial patterns reflect today's community
   differentiation among biogeographic regions and depth zones. Benthic
   fauna and OM mixtures were collected from two depth zones (100-150 m vs.
   200-250 m) within a temperate, two sub-Arctic, and an Arctic fjord along
   a latitudinal gradient (59-78 degrees N) that was used as a
   space-for-time substitution to assess the impact of climate change. Our
   results showed that Arctic and temperate communities are functionally
   different. Arctic communities were characterized by a strong resource
   partitioning among different feeding types, irrespective of depth zone.
   In contrast, all feeding types in temperate communities seemed to rely
   on sedimentary OM. The sub-Arctic presented a transition zone. In the
   sub-Arctic, shallower communities resembled Arctic communities,
   suggesting a functional transition between temperate and sub-Arctic
   regions. Deeper sub-Arctic communities resembled temperate communities,
   suggesting a functional transition between the sub-Arctic and Arctic
   regions. This implies that the regions north of the current transitions
   (deep Arctic and shallow sub-Arctic) are most likely to experience
   functional changes related to an altered OM utilization in benthic food
   webs in response to climate change.
   Arctic benthic communities show a strong resource partitioning among
   different feeding types, while all feeding types in temperate
   communities rely on sedimentary organic matter. The sub-Arctic presents
   a transition zone, with shallower communities resembling Arctic
   communities and deeper sub-Arctic communities resembling temperate
   communities. This implies that the regions north of the current
   transitions (deep Arctic and shallow sub-Arctic) are most likely to
   experience functional changes related to an altered organic matter
   utilization in benthic food webs in response to climate change.image",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Silberberger, MJ (Corresponding Author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Powstancow Warszawy 55, PL-81712 Sopot, Poland.

   of alien freshwater fishes",BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,2016,18,12,3495-3512,DEC,"Community level ecological traits are thought to affect invasibility as
   more diverse communities with complex trophic interactions may be
   associated with greater biotic resistance. Elucidation of the nature of
   this relationship is often hampered by difficulties in characterising
   food webs, particularly where field data are lacking. We attempted to
   overcome this by coupling food web modelling with information-theoretic
   analysis of the modelled webs. In addition, we also investigated the
   possibility that species level trends in trophic traits of established
   aliens might reflect exploitation of empty niches. We constructed
   hypothetical food webs of 26 natural and artificial lentic habitats from
   a data set consisting of 370 fish species representing 71 families.
   Using these food webs, we investigated associations at the community
   level between food web traits and network topology and number of alien
   fish species using an information-theoretic approach based on a set of
   competing a priori hypotheses. At the species level, we similarly tested
   for trends in trophic traits of established alien fishes using the
   information-theoretic approach in addition to nMDS of diet data. We
   found that native species richness in a community was the most important
   determinant of the number of alien fish taxa, displaying an inverse
   relationship. Our data also show that alien fish generally feed lower
   down the food web. Our findings suggest that the biotic resistance
   hypothesis, though scale dependent, can result in observable effects in
   animal communities. Moreover, we also found that the ability to exploit
   low energy yield food sources could favour the establishment of alien
   species via avoidance of resistive forces from native taxa.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Yeo, DCJ (Corresponding Author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, 14 Sci Dr 4, Singapore 117543, Singapore.

   eelgrass Zostera noltii",MARINE BIOLOGY,2009,156,10,2107-2120,SEP,"In estuaries, eelgrass meadows contribute to fundamental ecosystem
   functions of estuaries, providing food to several predators and
   buffering the negative effects of eutrophication. We asked whether the
   presence of the eelgrass Zostera noltii decreased the nitrogen
   concentration in the overlying water, affected the sources of nitrogen
   sequestrated by primary producers and changed the benthic and pelagic
   food web structures. We also studied the importance of these food webs
   in providing food to fish. We compared bare sediment to sediment covered
   by a Z. noltii meadow, and examined nutrient concentrations in the water
   column and delta N-15 in primary producers as indicators of
   anthropogenic inputs of nutrients. We then measured both delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 in the tissues of plants and consumers to establish food web
   structures. There were no differences in the concentrations and sources
   of nitrogen between sites. Rather, delta N-15 values indicated
   anthropogenic inputs of N (e.g. sewage discharges, agriculture) in both
   sites. There were no major differences in the structure of the
   planktonic food web, which was in part sustained by particulate organic
   matter and supported most predator fish, and in the structure of the
   benthic food web. Nonetheless, there were differences in the sources of
   food for omnivore consumers and for the detritivore Scrobicularia plana.
   Overall, the benthic food web did not use food derived from the eelgrass
   or macroalgae deposited on the substratum. Suspension feeders used
   particulate and sediment organic matter, whereas the delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 values of the other consumers indicated a likely contribution
   of benthic microalgae. Furthermore, in both habitats we found large
   variability in the isotope signatures of benthic macrofauna consumers,
   which did not allow distinguishing clearly different trophic groups and
   indicated a high level of omnivory and a mixed diet opportunistically

   response to habitat degradation",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2017,7,8,2626-2635,APR,"Diet specificity is likely to be the key predictor of a predator's
   vulnerability to changing habitat and prey conditions. Understanding the
   degree to which predatory coral reef fishes adjust or maintain prey
   choice, in response to declines in coral cover and changes in prey
   availability, is critical for predicting how they may respond to reef
   habitat degradation. Here, we use stable isotope analyses to
   characterize the trophic structure of predator-prey interactions on
   coral reefs of the Keppel Island Group on the southern Great Barrier
   Reef, Australia. These reefs, previously typified by exceptionally high
   coral cover, have recently lost much of their coral cover due to coral
   bleaching and frequent inundation by sediment-laden, freshwater flood
   plumes associated with increased rainfall patterns. Long-term monitoring
   of these reefs demonstrates that, as coral cover declined, there has
   been a decrease in prey biomass, and a shift in dominant prey species
   from pelagic plankton-feeding damselfishes to territorial benthic
   algal-feeding damselfishes, resulting in differences in the principal
   carbon pathways in the food web. Using isotopes, we tested whether this
   changing prey availability could be detected in the diet of a
   mesopredator (coral grouper, Plectropomus maculatus). The delta C-13
   signature in grouper tissue in the Keppel Islands shifted from a more
   pelagic to a more benthic signal, demonstrating a change in carbon
   sources aligning with the change in prey availability due to habitat
   degradation. Grouper with a more benthic carbon signature were also
   feeding at a lower trophic level, indicating a shortening in food
   chains. Further, we found a decline in the coral grouper population
   accompanying a decrease in total available prey biomass. Thus, while the
   ability to adapt diets could ameliorate the short-term impacts of
   habitat degradation on mesopredators, long-term effects may negatively
   impact mesopredator populations and alter the trophic structure of coral
   reef food webs.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Hempson, TN (Corresponding Author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia.

Article,Jessica L. East and Christopher Wilcut and Allison A. Pease,Aquatic food-web structure along a salinized dryland river,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2017,62,4,681-694,APR,"1. Very little is known about the ecosystem impacts of river
   salinization despite expectations for global increases in salinization
   with growing water demand and climate change. In some rivers in the
   southwestern United States, salinization has occurred as a result of
   natural saline inputs exacerbated by flow alteration and other
   anthropogenic impacts. Salinization in the Pecos River has been linked
   to declines in fish diversity, but impacts on the structure of aquatic
   food webs have not been investigated.
   2. We assessed variation in local food webs along the longitudinal
   gradient of the main stem Pecos River by estimating carbon sources,
   trophic positions and assemblage-wide trophic structure for aquatic
   consumers at 12 sites using stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and
   delta N-15). Temporal variation across seasons was also examined for
   common fish species at a subset of sites.
   3. Consumer richness, food-chain length and assemblage-wide niche
   breadth were inversely related to specific conductivity. Mixing models
   revealed differences in sources of dietary carbon supporting fish
   production along the longitudinal fluvial gradient, with a shift towards
   reliance on algal production in the salinized reaches of the river.
   Trophic niche breadth was greatest for assemblages in less degraded
   sites with higher fish species richness. Local food webs in salinized
   sites were dominated by euryhaline species and had shorter food chains
   and narrower assemblage-wide niche breadths. Across seasons, delta C-13
   and delta N-15 signatures remained fairly constant for five common fish
   species.
   4. Our results suggest that salinization in portions of the Pecos River
   constrains the diversity of consumers and trophic resources in local
   food webs. Characterising changes in food-web structure in relation to
   salinization and other environmental changes is important for habitat
   assessment, stream restoration and other conservation strategies.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Pease, AA (Corresponding Author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Nat Resources Management, Box 42125, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.

   Cumulative Effects of Forest Management",ECOSYSTEMS,2022,25,6,1311-1327,SEP,"The river continuum concept (RCC) predicts a downstream shift in the
   reliance of aquatic consumers from terrestrial to aquatic carbon
   sources, but this concept has rarely been assessed with longitudinal
   studies. Similarly, there are no studies addressing how forestry related
   disturbances to the structure of headwater food webs manifest
   (accumulate/dissipate) downstream and/or whether forest management
   alters natural longitudinal trends predicted by the RCC. Using stable
   isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen, we investigated how: 1)
   autochthony in macroinvertebrates and fish change from small streams to
   larger downstream sites within a basin with minimal forest management
   (New Brunswick, Canada); 2) longitudinal trends in autochthony and food
   web length compare among three basins with different forest management
   intensity {[}intensive (harvest and replanting), extensive (harvest
   only), minimal] to detect potential cumulative/dissipative effects; and
   3) forest management intensity and other catchment variables are
   influencing food web dynamics. We showed that, as predicted, the
   reliance of some macroinvertebrate taxa (especially collector feeders)
   on algae increased from small streams to downstream waters in the
   minimally managed basin, but that autochthony in the smallest shaded
   stream was higher than expected based on the RCC (as high as 90\% for
   some taxa). However, this longitudinal increase in autochthony was not
   observed within the extensively managed basin and was weaker within the
   intensively managed one, suggesting that forest management can alter
   food web dynamics along the river continuum. The dampening of downstream
   autochthony indicates that the increased allochthony observed in small
   streams in response to forest harvesting cumulates downstream through
   the river continuum.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Article,English,"Erdozain, M (Corresponding Author), Univ New Brunswick, Canadian Rivers Inst, 100 Tucker Pk Rd, St John, NB E2L 4L5, Canada.

   achieving optimal nitrogen management in urban estuaries and
   gate-controlled rivers. However, in plains river networks, gate and/or
   dam construction make the nitrogen sources difficult to trace. In this
   study, seasonal water samples from typical urban estuaries and
   gate-controlled rivers in northern Taihu Lake were analyzed using
   statistical analysis and stable isotope analysis in R (SIAR). The
   results show that the concentrations of various nitrogen forms showed
   obvious spatial-temporal distribution characteristics by multiple
   sources. Specifically, the nitrogen concentration was lower during the
   wet season than the dry season (T = 6.02, p < 0.01). Gate construction
   had a dual effect on the water environment, because it changed both the
   nitrogen transport processes and the nitrogen enrichment risk between

   According to the SIAR model, sewage/manure, fertilizer, and sediment
   nitrogen (sediment N) were the main nitrate sources, accounting for
   42.68\%, 23.79\%, and 23.71\%, respectively. The proportion of urban
   nitrogen discharge has surpassed that of agricultural sources, becoming
   the largest nitrogen source in the waterbody. Under the coupling of
   meteorological conditions and estuary shape, the endogenous nitrogen
   released from sediment became the second largest contributor in some
   estuaries. These findings suggest that it is necessary to strengthen the
   control of urban exogenous nitrogen input and sediment nitrogen
   endogenous release to enable future estuarine nitrogen management and

   little is known of the trophodynamics, or of its faunal communities.
   Carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition was used to assess its trophic
   pathways and the food web structure {[}food sources and trophic levels
   (TL)]. Basal food sources were distinguishable based on their delta C-13
   values, ranging from -27.2 to -15.2aEuro degrees. Consumers were also
   well separated in delta C-13 (-26.9 to -17.9aEuro degrees for
   invertebrates and -25.7 to -18.1aEuro degrees for fishes), which allowed
   for an effective discrimination of carbon sources between these fauna.
   An average trophic enrichment factor of 3.4aEuro degrees was used to
   calculate the TLs based on delta N-15 of zooplankton, with results
   indicating a food web having four TLs. Although delta N-15 values
   overlap and cover a large range within trophic compartments, the
   isotopic signatures of the species assessed revealed a general trend of
   N-15 enrichment with increasing TL. Stable isotope signatures were also

Article,Marie C. Nordstroem and Amanda W. J. Demopoulos and Christine R. Whitcraft and Andrea Rismondo and Patricia McMillan and Jennifer P. Gonzalez and Lisa A. Levin,Food web heterogeneity and succession in created saltmarshes,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2015,52,5,1343-1354,OCT,"Ecological restoration must achieve functional as well as structural
   recovery. Functional metrics for re-establishment of trophic
   interactions can be used to complement traditional monitoring of
   structural attributes. In addition, topographic effects on food web
   structure provide added information within a restoration context; often,
   created sites may require spatial heterogeneity to effectively match
   structure and function of natural habitats. We addressed both of these
   issues in our study of successional development of benthic food web
   structure, with focus on bottom-up-driven changes in macroinvertebrate
   consumer assemblages in the saltmarshes of the Venice Lagoon, Italy. We
   combined quantified estimates of the changing community composition with
   stable isotope data (C-13:C-12 and N-15:N-14) to compare the general
   trophic structure between created (2-14years) marshes and reference
   sites and along topographic elevation gradients within saltmarshes.
   Macrofaunal invertebrate consumers exhibited local, habitat-specific
   trophic patterns. Stable isotope-based trophic structure changed with
   increasing marsh age, in particular with regard to mid-elevation
   (Salicornia) habitats. In young marshes, the mid-elevation consumer
   signatures resembled those of unvegetated ponds. The mid-elevation of
   older and natural marshes had a more distinct Salicornia zone food web,
   occasionally resembling that of the highest (Sarcocornia-dominated)
   elevation. In summary, this indicates that primary producers and
   availability of vascular plant detritus structure consumer trophic
   interactions and the flow of carbon. Functionally different consumers,
   subsurface-feeding detritivores (Oligochaeta) and surface grazers
   (Hydrobia sp.), showed distinct but converging trajectories of isotopic
   change over time, indicating that successional development may be
   asymmetric between brown' (detrital) guilds and green' (grazing) guilds
   in the food web.Synthesis and applications. Created marsh food webs
   converged into a natural state over about a decade, with successional
   shifts seen in both consumer community composition and stable isotope
   space. Strong spatial effects were noted, highlighting the utility of
   stable isotopes to evaluate functional equivalence in spatially
   heterogeneous systems. Understanding the recovery of functional
   properties such as food web support, and their inherent spatial
   variability, is key to planning and managing successful habitat
   restoration.

   introduction to a sub-Arctic watershed using stable isotopes",FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY,2013,20,4,302-314,AUG,"Anadromous Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (L.), was introduced to a
   sub-Arctic river-lake system near the village of Kujjuuaq, Nunavik, and
   the stable isotope values and diets of key resident fish species were
   used to assess changes in feeding patterns. Stable isotope values for
   most species did not differ significantly between the pre- and
   post-introduction periods, with observed shifts being within the bounds
   of expected natural variation. Lake chub, Couesius plumbeus (Agassiz),
   were the single species to show a difference between study periods, with
   a small but significant increase in N-15. No significant
   post-introduction changes were seen in lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush
   (Walbaum), omnivory or in any of the assessed quantitative food web
   metrics. Gut contents of major fish species similarly showed significant
   temporal overlap between the pre- and post-introduction periods, and
   there was no significant change in species' weight-length relationships.
   The minor ecological impact was interpreted in relation to the
   availability of open niches exploitable by ecological generalists such
   as Arctic charr. The explanation accords with the known habitat and
   feeding flexibility of Arctic charr and the ecological immaturity of
   sub-Arctic lakes known to have driven adaptive variation among Arctic
   charr. Findings suggest that anadromous Arctic charr may be introduced

   deep coastal ocean",ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,2019,89,3,NA,AUG,"Macroalgae drive the largest CO2 flux fixed globally by marine
   macrophytes. Most of the resulting biomass is exported through the
   coastal ocean as detritus and yet almost no field measurements have
   verified its potential net sequestration in marine sediments. This gap
   limits the scope for the inclusion of macroalgae within blue carbon
   schemes that support ocean carbon sequestration globally, and the
   understanding of the role their carbon plays within distal food webs.
   Here, we pursued three lines of evidence (eDNA sequencing, Bayesian
   Stable Isotope Mixing Modeling, and benthic-pelagic process
   measurements) to generate needed, novel data addressing this gap. To
   this end, a 13-month study was undertaken at a deep coastal sedimentary
   site in the English Channel, and the surrounding shoreline of Plymouth,
   UK. The eDNA sequencing indicated that detritus from most macroalgae in
   surrounding shores occurs within deep, coastal sediments, with detritus
   supply reflecting the seasonal ecology of individual species. Bayesian
   stable isotope mixing modeling {[}C and N] highlighted its vital role in
   supporting the deep coastal benthic food web (22-36\% of diets),
   especially when other resources are seasonally low. The magnitude of
   detritus uptake within the food web and sediments varies seasonally,
   with an average net sedimentary organic macroalgal carbon sequestration
   of 8.75 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1). The average net
   sequestration of particulate organic carbon in sediments is 58.74 g C
   center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), the two rates corresponding to 4-5\%
   and 26-37\% of those associated with mangroves, salt marshes, and
   seagrass beds, systems more readily identified as blue carbon habitats.
   These novel data provide important first estimates that help to
   contextualize the importance of macroalgal-sedimentary connectivity for
   deep coastal food webs, and measured fluxes help constrain its role
   within global blue carbon that can support policy development. At a time
   when climate change mitigation is at the foreground of environmental
   policy development, embracing the full potential of the ocean in
   supporting climate regulation via CO2 sequestration is a necessity.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Queirós, AM (Corresponding Author), Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England.

   of ecological and evolutionary outcomes, including local extirpations.
   In the Laurentian Great Lakes, competition for food may explain the
   dramatic decline of Diporeia spp. amphipods following the introduction
   of dreissenid mussels. This hypothesis has not been confirmed, in part
   because dreissenids and Diporeia appear to co-exist and flourish in
   other systems, including the Finger Lakes of New York. We used carbon,
   nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen stable isotope ratios to examine resource
   use by Diporeia from three spatially distinct populations (Lake
   Michigan, Lake Superior, and Cayuga Lake), dreissenids from areas where
   they co-occur with Diporeia (Lake Michigan and Cayuga Lake), and
   Diporeia from Lake Michigan collected before and after dreissenid
   invasion (1986-2009). Our results suggest that dreissenids may affect
   resource use by Diporeia in areas of co-occurrence, but the extent to
   which those effects are positive or negative is unclear. Terrestrial
   inputs may provide an important subsidy for Diporeia populations in
   small systems but may not be substantial enough in the Great Lakes to
   ensure that both taxa thrive.","CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS","65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",Article,English,"Foley, CJ (Corresponding Author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry \& Nat Resources, Illinois Indiana Sea Grant Coll Program, 195 Marsteller St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.

   scales for retrospective study of shallow lake responses to nutrient
   reduction",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2009,54,8,1663-1670,AUG,"1. There is increasing interest in the use of stable isotope analysis of
   archived materials to study the long-term impacts of lake perturbations,
   including nutrient manipulation or species invasion. We tested the
   utility of this approach in a shallow productive lake using the
   zooplanktivorous early life stages of roach ( Rutilus rutilus), a fish
   species that is widespread throughout Eurasian lakes.
   2. Barton Broad is a shallow lake with a well-documented history of
   earlier eutrophication followed by nutrient reduction, including
   sediment removal from 1997 to 2000. Using scale samples collected pre-
   and post-sediment removal, we demonstrated a strong, positive
   relationship between roach scale delta(13)C and total phosphorus. We
   argue that this reflects a decrease in the phytoplankton production
   which had dominated dissolved inorganic carbon dynamics, and a relative
   increase in the contribution of respired carbon in the food web.
   3. We also derived a scale : muscle isotope relationship for roach which
   allowed us to model changes in fish muscle against putative prey.
   Concomitant isotopic shifts in preserved zooplankton samples indicated
   that the phosphorus reduction measures had an ecosystem-wide impact and
   that changes in roach scale isotope values were not a result of fish
   switching diet.
   4. Roach scale delta(15)N increased after sediment removal. Since this
   was not due to a switch in fish diet, we suggest that it probably
   reflects the loss of nitrogen-fixing, heterocystous cyanobacteria from
   the plankton.","WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC","COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",Article,English,"Grey, J (Corresponding Author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol \& Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England.

   variations of the food web structure in a large eutrophic lake ecosystem
   (Lake Taihu, China). Basal food sources, invertebrates and fish were
   sampled in two lake regions with different environmental conditions and
   spatial variations in the isotopic composition of lake food webs were
   found. Overall, more depleted delta C-13 and enriched delta N-15 isotope
   values of organic matter sources and consumers were found in the
   phytoplankton-dominated lake region than in the macrophyte-dominated
   region. Wide seasonal variations in the isotopic ratios were also
   observed in the lake biota, with a general trend towards enriched delta
   C-13 and delta N-15 values in summer and depleted values in winter. This
   pattern could be explained by a combination of environmental (e.g.,
   irradiance and nutrient inputs) and biotic (e.g., availability of food
   sources and plasticity in prey item choice) features. Results of isotope
   mass balance suggest that macrophytes provide some trophic support in
   the macrophyte-dominated area, but in both lake regions it is more
   likely that aquatic food webs are phytoplankton based rather than

   family) have biological traits that make them successful invaders.
   Widespread herbivory has been observed across tilapia species, however
   knowledge on habitat preferences and tilapia interactions with native
   fish food webs is limited. This study was conducted three years after
   spotted (Pelmatolapia mariae) and Mozambique (Oreochromis mossambicus)
   tilapia were detected in the Mitchell River catchment, northern
   Australia. Tilapia diet and habitat preferences and their trophic
   position in native fish food webs was determined using a combination of
   stomach content, stable isotope, and habitat assessment analyses. Plant
   material was the most abundant item in tilapia stomachs, and some
   stomachs also contained other items in small quantities, such as fish
   eggs, small shrimp, and bivalves. Some niche overlap occurred between P.
   mariae and native omnivore or herbivore fish species. Macrohabitat type
   (in-channel (no tilapia), floodplain (no tilapia), weir (tilapia
   present)) was related to native fish food web structure, with weir food
   webs showing similarities to floodplain food webs. Floodplain habitats
   including creeks and wetlands were also most similar to weir habitats
   and may therefore be most at risk of colonization as tilapia spread
   throughout the catchment. This study clearly demonstrated that the
   successful rapid invasion of these two tilapia species is linked to
   suitable habitat with abundant food that fuels growth and reproduction.
   These findings increase understanding of diet related habitat use during
   new tilapia invasions and trophic interactions with native species.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Article; Early Access,English,"O'Mara, K (Corresponding Author), Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Nathan, Qld, Australia.

   can influence interpretation of trophic relationships in ecosystems, and
   significant variation in delta N-15 signatures has been reported in
   streams and rivers. However, a comprehensive understanding of the main
   factors driving delta N-15 variability is lacking, and this variability
   confounds the consumer's trophic-level position during delta N-15
   analysis. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the variability in
   delta N-15 natural abundance of basal resources and dissolved inorganic
   N (DIN) in streams and rivers in relation to the environmental factors
   that may drive this variability. The meta-analysis was based on a
   literature review over the last 20 y (1989-2009) and contained
   signatures of delta N-15-DIN (delta N-15-NO3 and delta N-15-NH4) and
   delta N-15-basal resources (delta N-15-detrital compartments, delta
   N-15-biofilm, delta N-15-algae, and delta N-15-macrophytes) from >100

   delta N-15-NO3, even though NH4+ is assimilated rapidly by basal
   resources. The range of delta N-15-basal resources was also broad (-4-16
   parts per thousand) within and among compartments. Human land use was
   the most significant factor explaining variability in delta N-15-DIN and
   delta N-15-basal resource signatures. We found significant differences
   between delta N-15 signatures of photoautotrophic (i.e., autochthonous)
   and detrital (i.e., allochthonous) basal resources. Our results point
   out the difficulty in defining a baseline delta N-15 signature of the

   miles) from the Indo-Pacific have invaded the northwest Atlantic Ocean,
   Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. As generalist predators with a
   broad diet, they could pose a major threat to economically and
   ecologically important species and, therefore, the overall health of
   coral reef ecosystems and the communities that rely on them. In Bermuda,
   the lionfish invasion appears to be progressing at a slower rate than
   elsewhere in the invaded range, providing an opportunity to study their
   ecological impact at an early stage. This study used stable isotope
   analysis of lionfish, their major prey, and their competitors to
   investigate the feeding ecology of lionfish in Bermuda and provide a
   more complete evaluation of their potential impacts on community
   structure and trophic interactions. Results suggest that lionfish in
   Bermuda primarily derive resources from the plankton-based food web,
   with only a small contribution from food chains supported by macroalgae.
   Further, it appears that lionfish resource use overlaps substantially
   with other similarly sized sympatric mesopredators, in particular the
   coney grouper (Cephalopholis fulva), a species commonly targeted by
   local commercial fisheries. This visualization of Bermuda's demersal
   ecosystem in two-dimensional isotope space, the first of its kind, will
   help track the ecological impact of lionfish over time, predict
   potential changes in community structure, and better inform developing

   subsistence strategies after its fall. The present study explores the
   dietary changes at the Roman to post-Roman (Germanic) transition in the
   Northwest Iberian Peninsula, in order to improve our understanding of
   the changes that occurred at end of the Roman Empire in different
   regions across Europe and to also consider the influence of climate had
   on them. The carbon and nitrogen stable isotope investigation in bone
   collagen from A Lanzada, NW Spain (100-700 AD), which was an important
   commercial, coastal settlement has been presented. A human sample of 59
   individuals, 6 of them subadults, is compared with 31 faunal specimens,
   which include a number of marine fish. Isotope data for the terrestrial
   fauna reveal the influence of the sea on the local isotope baseline.
   Analysis of the human samples indicates a mixed marine-terrestrial diet.
   A shift in mean human C-13 values from -16.7 parts per thousand to -14.3
   parts per thousand provides clear evidence for a significant change in
   diet in the post-Roman period, probably through the intensification of
   both marine resources exploitation and C-4-plant consumption (presumably
   millet). A deterioration of paleoenvironmental conditions, together with
   a poor socioeconomic situation and the arrival of new people, the
   Sueves, who brought a new political and socioeconomic system have been
   discussed as the main causes for the dietary modification in post-Roman
   times.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"López-Costas, O (Corresponding Author), Stockholm Univ, AFL, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.

   controlling the spatial distribution and ecology of estuarine fish",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,2019,630,NA,197-214,NOV 7,"Estuaries are among the most productive ecosystems per unit area, but
   this productivity is unevenly distributed across a complex mosaic of
   habitats. Identifying the qualities of different habitats that influence
   the composition and productivity of biotic communities is fundamental to
   understanding the dynamics of these ecosystems. We combined field
   surveys, hydrological modelling and stable isotope analysis to
   understand the roles of habitat, hydrological connectivity, salinity and
   temperature in determining assemblage composition, species abundance and
   trophic ecology of an estuarine fish community. Hydrodynamics,
   vegetation matrices of macroalgae and seagrass and the presence of
   epiphytes on vegetation explained spatial patterns in taxonomic
   biodiversity, multivariate assemblage structure and the occurrence of
   juvenile black bream Acanthopagrus butcheri, a species that possesses
   ecological traits common to many demersal estuarine fish species.
   Juvenile bream abundance was related to vegetation composition
   (particularly epiphyte presence), supporting the hypothesis that
   juvenile habitats that provided resources or conditions that extended
   beyond just structure conferred more ecological advantages. This was
   further evidenced by stable isotope-based estimates of basal resource
   contributions of epiphytes. Our findings suggest that hydrodynamic
   connectivity with riverine water masses acts as a coarse determinant for
   estuarine fish communities at large spatial scales. At smaller scales,
   habitat-level associations influence local abundances and the identity
   and importance of specific trophic resources. Coupling hydrodynamic
   modelling with natural biomarkers provides a powerful approach for
   assessing the spatial context of habitat use that can help resource
   managers prioritize monitoring and habitat preservation efforts for
   coastal fish communities in a changing global environment.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",Article,English,"Woodland, RJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USA.

   headwater food webs in seven headwater streams in the Upper
   Chattahoochee basin, GA, U.S.A where percentage forest in catchments
   ranged from 82 to 96\%. We measured terrestrial organic matter standing
   crop and determined consumer (crayfish and insectivorous fish)
   dependence on terrestrial versus aquatic energy sources via gut content
   and stable isotope analyses.
   2. Standing crop of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) declined
   with deforestation at large scales (i.e. catchment deforestation and
   riparian deforestation at the entire stream network scale). Terrestrial
   plant matter, the dominant component of crayfish guts, declined in
   crayfish guts with reductions in CPOM standing crop and with
   deforestation.
   3. Crayfish and insectivorous fish delta(13)C showed enrichment trends
   with deforestation, indicating isotopic divergence from CPOM, the most
   C-13-depleted basal resource, with reductions in catchment and riparian
   forest cover. Crayfish delta(13)C also exhibited enrichment with
   decreased instream CPOM standing crop.
   4. A concentration-dependent mixing model was used to calculate the
   relative dependence of crayfish and fish on terrestrial versus aquatic
   basal resources. Results suggested that both allochthonous CPOM and
   autochthonous production were important basal resources. Consumer
   dependence on CPOM decreased with reductions in canopy cover.
   5. Our data suggest the importance of forest cover to headwater food
   webs at multiple scales, and that relatively low levels of riparian

   Our results showed that stable isotope signatures among different sorts

   that the food chain consisted of four trophic levels, indicating the
   multiple trophic pathways and long food chain length here. The trophic
   guilds of fish were classified into four categories, in which
   herbivorous and carnivorous fish showed greater trophic diversity and
   omnivorous fish had higher trophic redundancy, which meant that there
   was a stable trophic niche structure in the study area. Phytoplankton
   and periphyton presented the largest contributions to consumers,
   indicating that autochthonous productivity was the dominant carbon
   source in the midstream of the Chishui River. Since the Chishui River is
   still in a natural condition without any dam constructions, the
   autochthonous productivity, stable trophic niche structure, multiple

   lake",FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,2022,10,NA,NA,SEP 9,"Assessing food web structural properties and energy fluxes under
   changing hydrological regimes and water quality reveals the temporal
   patterns of ecosystem dynamics in shallow lakes. Here, we studied
   northern China's largest shallow lake (Lake Baiyangdian) using
   quantitative food web models for five representative years (1958, 1980,
   1993, 2009, and 2019). We analyzed the temporal patterns of food web
   structure and function by combining a Bayesian isotope mixing model with
   a food web energetics model. We further examined the temporal changes of
   unweighted and weighted food web topological attributes. Lake
   Baiyangdian changed from a detritus-based into a phytoplankton-based
   food web based on the relative contributions of basal food sources and
   energy flux distributions. The trophic position of fingerlings, large
   omnivorous fish, and carnivorous fish decreased with increasing
   eutrophication. The highest energy fluxes were from detritus to
   zooplankton and mollusks in 1958, from detritus and phytoplankton to
   zooplankton in 1980, 1993, and 2009, and from phytoplankton to
   zooplankton and detritus to mollusks in 2019. The highest total energy
   flux was in 1993, followed by 2019, with the lowest value in 1958.
   Unweighted food web metrics showed similar patterns. We observed more
   pronounced temporal variability in the node- and link-weighted food web
   metrics than in the unweighted metrics. In addition, hydrological
   factors (threshold, duration, reversals between high, and low water
   levels), eutrophication, and some water quality factors (chemical oxygen
   demand, dissolved oxygen, and pH) played important roles in the temporal
   changes of food web dynamics in Lake Baiyangdian. Our findings
   demonstrate the importance of integrating unweighted and weighted
   indicators to holistically comprehend how highly aggregated food webs
   respond to changing hydrological regimes and water quality, thereby

   Feeding Ecology in Arctic Beluga (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>)
   Populations",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY,2022,56,1,271-281,JAN 4,"We assessed long-term changes in the feeding ecology and mercury (Hg)
   accumulation in Eastern High Arctic-Baffin Bay beluga (Delphinapterus
   leucas) using total Hg and stable isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15)
   assays in teeth samples from historical (1854-1905) and modern
   (1985-2000) populations. Mean delta C-13 values in teeth declined
   significantly over time, from -13.01 +/- 0.55 parts per thousand
   historically to -14.41 +/- 0.28 parts per thousand in 2000, while no
   consistent pattern was evident for delta N-15 due to high individual
   variability within each period. The temporal shift in isotopic niche is
   consistent with beluga feeding ecology changing in recent decades to a
   more pelagic and less isotopically diverse diet or an ecosystem wide
   change in isotope profiles. Mercury concentrations in modern beluga
   teeth were 3-5 times higher on average than those in historical beluga.
   These results are similar to the long-term trends of Hg and feeding
   ecology reported in other beluga populations and in other Arctic marine
   predators. Similar feeding ecology shifts across regions and species
   indicate a consistent increased pelagic diet response to climate change
   as the Arctic Ocean progressively warmed and lost sea ice. Previously,
   significant temporal Hg increase in beluga and other Arctic animals was
   attributed solely to direct inputs of anthropogenic Hg from long-range
   sources. Recent advances in understanding the Arctic marine Hg cycle
   suggest an additional, complementary possibility-increased inputs of
   terrestrial Hg of mixed anthropogenic-natural origin, mobilized from
   permafrost and other Arctic soils by climate warming. At present, it is
   not possible to assign relative importance to the two processes in
   explaining the rise of Hg concentrations in modern Arctic marine

   Commaa, are a low-impact and culturally important aquaculture system
   that historically produced significant fish yields. To better understand
   the structure of the contemporary food web of the restored HeModified
   Letter Turned Commaeia fishpond, a mark-recapture experiment was
   conducted to estimate the population abundance of the three dominant
   predatory fishes, and gut content, genetic barcoding, and stable isotope
   analyses were used to assess their diets. Great barracuda Sphyraena
   barracuda had the largest estimated population at 190 individuals,
   followed by 89 giant trevally Caranx ignobilis and 19 bluefin trevally
   Caranx melampygus. The three species were caught throughout the pond,
   with C. ignobilis concentrated in the deeper northwest area near a
   mangrove island. Diets of the three species consisted mainly of
   nearshore, estuarine fishes, and crustaceans. Prey taxonomic resolution
   was greatly improved with the use of genetic barcoding since most fish
   were too degraded to be visually identified. Trophic level calculations
   and isotopic niche breadth comparisons indicated that C. ignobilis and
   S. barracuda occupied similar ecological niches in the fishpond, and
   stable isotope mixing models revealed that their long-term diets were
   mostly comprised glass shrimp (Palaemon sp.), mangrove swimming crab
   (Thalamita crenata), and an invasive Australian mullet (Osteomugil
   engeli). The native mullet (Mugil cephalus), a primary food fish species
   from the fishpond, was not identified in the diets of the predatory
   fishes in this study nor in a previous diet study decades ago prior to
   the introduction of Australian mullet. The inclusion of the invasive
   Australian mullet in the contemporary diets of the predatory fishes
   demonstrates a shift towards the newly available prey which may benefit
   the native mullet populations. These findings improve the understanding
   of food web dynamics in contemporary Hawaiian fishponds and provide an
   example of native predatory fishes consuming an invasive species as part
   of their diets.
   Traditional Hawaiian fishponds are an important aquaculture resource,
   yet the fish populations within them remain woefully understudied. The
   results of our research show that the dominant predatory fish species do
   not prey upon the herbivorous fish typically raised in these systems,
   but have added an invasive fish species to their diets. This work
   furthers the scientific understanding of traditional aquaculture
   fishpond systems in Hawai?i and other tropical coastal ecosystems.image",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Franklin, EC (Corresponding Author), Univ Hawaii, Sch Ocean \& Earth Sci \& Technol, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.

   artificial tidal flat in inner Tokyo Bay, Japan, using carbon and
   nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15).
   Microphytobenthos were the most important food sources of
   macrozoobenthos, due to high microphytobenthic biomass on the tidal
   flat, while phytoplankton in canal water (canal POMPP), terrestrial
   materials from urban surface runoff (canal POMTM), and marsh plants were
   less important. Dietary contribution of microphytobenthos was highest in
   April to June, while decreased towards December owing to the supply of
   canal POMPP and canal POMTM following red tides and heavy rainfall
   events in summer to fall. Temporal changes in delta N-15 (Delta delta
   N-15) of consumer corresponded well to the N-15-enrichment in canal
   POMPP in summer. A meta-analysis showed that the consumer-Delta delta
   N-15 was considerably larger in inner Tokyo Bay than those in other
   estuaries, which may be a specific characteristic of benthic food web in
   highly urbanized estuaries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Kanaya, G (Corresponding Author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.

   and reproductive phenology is predicted to strongly influence freshwater
   fish community structure in some systems. Despite its potential
   importance, few long-term studies of reproductive phenology in river
   fishes have been conducted in a community context. Here, we evaluated
   timing and sequence of reproduction of fishes in the Rio Grande, New
   Mexico over 9 years. Dates and rank order of first appearance of larvae
   varied among species and years, but three consistent spawning guilds
   were evident: early season, late season, and species that were
   intermediate in rank order of spawning. We hypothesized that appropriate
   reproductive timing enhanced recruitment to the extent that spawning
   cues predicted future availability of critical resources for larvae.
   Analysis of historical discharge records indicated that present and
   future discharge exhibited positive auto correlation for up to 90 d.
   Likewise, larval fish densities were highest at moderate flows and
   coincident with high food resource abundance. However, stable isotope
   data for larval and adult fishes indicated considerable overlap in food
   resource use among larvae and adult fishes. There maybe pressure for
   spawning time to converge among species to match the appearance of
   seasonal resources, but to diverge to lessen competition among
   young-of-year fishes in a classical trade-off scenario. More long-term
   studies are needed, and we propose that an integrated research program
   that combines detailed analysis of reproductive phenology, food web
   dynamics, and comparative genomic analyses could forge connections
   between environmental variation in spawning cues, recruitment success,
   and community assembly in river fishes. Such an integrated program could
   lead to better predictions about fish community responses to global
   warming, especially in vulnerable arid-land systems like the Rio Grande.",AMER FISHERIES SOC,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE, STE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Turner, TF (Corresponding Author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, MSC 03-2020, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.

   archeological excavations at the Wasden Site in southeastern Idaho
   suggests that changing frequency distributions through time represent a
   shift in climate during the early Holocene from a cooler, wetter regime
   to a warmer, drier one. This conclusion was re-evaluated using stable
   carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of bone collagen from the three
   species of small mammals examined in the earlier studies: pocket gophers
   (Thomomys talpoides), pygmy rabbits (Brachylagus idahoensis), and ground
   squirrels (Spermophilus townsendii). Resulting carbon and nitrogen
   isotopic values are consistent with known differences in feeding
   ecology, suggesting high fidelity as proxies for past vegetation (and
   thus climate) regimes. Patterns of N-15 enrichment and increased
   representation of C-4-CAM vegetation observed in the pocket gophers, and
   to a lesser extent ground squirrels, suggests increasing warmth and/or
   aridity from the early Holocene until similar to 7000 cal yr BP, thus
   supporting previous hypotheses of climate change on the eastern Snake
   River Plain. The results highlight the potential contribution of such
   studies for archeological research by providing additional proxies for
   environmental conditions that bear on paleoecological adaptations to
   climatic change, including past human use and occupation of the region.

   eutrophication",JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH,2008,60,4,287-298,NOV,"The food web structure and functioning of two north-western
   Mediterranean lagoons exhibiting contrasting degrees of eutrophication
   and marine influences were compared through delta C-13 and delta N-15
   analysis of major potential food sources and consumers. The Lapalme
   Lagoon is well preserved and has kept a natural and temporary connection
   with the open sea. Conversely, the Canet Lagoon is heavily eutrophicated
   and its water exchange with the open sea has been artificially reduced.
   In Lapalme, all potential food sources and consumers exhibited delta
   N-15 values indicative of pristine coastal areas. Suspended particulate
   organic matter (POM) and sediment organic matter (SOM) pools seemed to
   constitute the main food sources of most primary consumers. Both primary
   producers and all consumers were much more N-15-enriched (by similar to
   10 parts per thousand) and more C-13-depleted in Canet than in Lapalme.
   This reflected: (1) the assimilation of important amounts of
   anthropogenic nitrogen in the food web, and (2) a marked and uniform
   influence of C-13-depleted allochtonous sources of carbon. Based on the
   mean delta N-15 of primary consumers, we found rather similar food web
   lengths in both lagoons with top consumers at trophic levels 3.6 and 4.0
   in Canet and Lapalme, respectively. However, the eutrophication of the
   Canet Lagoon resulted in a simplification of the food web structure
   (i.e., a single trophic pathway from a N-15-enriched fraction of the SOM
   pool to top predators) compared to what was observed in Lapalme Lagoon
   where additional C-13-enriched food sources played a significant trophic
   role. Moreover, some consumers of Canet tended to exploit primary
   producers to a larger extent (and thus to exhibit lower trophic levels)
   than in Lapalme. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

   unprecedented change in the coming decades. The identification of food
   web structures that confer stability to these systems is, therefore, a
   priority. Here, we use stable isotopes and fatty acids to resolve the
   food web structure of a seasonally ice-covered fjord (Cumberland Sound,
   Baffin Island, Canada) sampled in late summer. We show that the food web
   is structured such that upper trophic levels couple separate energy
   channels (based on phytoplankton or macroalgae), a previously documented
   food web structure that has been linked with stability in temperate
   ecosystems, but never established in a seasonally dynamic, ice-covered
   ecosystem. Herbivorous zooplankton (e.g. Calanus hyperboreus) relied
   exclusively on phytoplankton, whereas herbivorous benthos used either
   phytodetritus (e.g. Hiatella arctica) or macroalgae (e.g. Tectura
   testudinalis), supporting the existence of separate energy channels.
   Upper trophic level fishes and marine mammals relied more heavily on
   phytoplankton-than macroalgal-derived carbon (58 to 100\% reliance on
   phytoplankton), but 6 out of 8 species sampled derived energy from both
   carbon sources. Since benthic invertebrate predators used both
   phytodetrital- and macrolgal-based resources, the coupling of separate
   energy channels was also iterated within the benthos. The temporally
   pulsed nature of phytoplankton production, characteristic of Arctic
   seas, indicates that Arctic consumers also act as couplers of resources
   in time because phytoplankton-and detrital-based carbon would likely
   reach upper trophic levels earlier and later in the season,
   respectively. Potential changes in the relative production of macroalgae
   and phytoplankton under climate change scenarios could impact the
   stability-promoting food web structure reported here.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",Article,English,"McMeans, BC (Corresponding Author), Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.

   oceanographic transitions",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,2018,593,NA,29-45,APR 12,"Antarctic marine ecosystems are spatially and temporally dynamic.
   Regional climate change is significantly altering the patterns and
   magnitudes of this dynamism with cascading impacts on biogeochemistry,
   productivity, and food web architecture. Isoscapes (or isotopic maps)
   provide a valuable analytical framework to characterize ecosystem
   processes and address questions about trophic dynamics, animal movement,
   and elemental cycling. Applications of stable isotope methods to
   Antarctic ecosystems are currently limited by a paucity of information
   on geospatial isotope characteristics within the Southern Ocean. In
   response, we have created the first empirically derived zooplankton
   isoscapes for West Antarctica based on analysis of bulk nitrogen and
   carbon isotope values (delta N-15 and delta C-13) in 94 zooplankton
   specimens from the Drake Passage, West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), and
   Amundsen and Ross Seas. The zooplankton delta N-15 values increased by
   3\% from north of the Polar Front (3.3 +/- 0.6\%, mean +/- SD) to the
   Ross Sea (6.2 +/- 0.8\%), reflecting a productivity gradient across this
   region. Abundant open water polynyas in the Amundsen and Ross Seas
   exhibit strong nitrate drawdown, resulting in more N-15-enriched
   phytoplankton and zooplankton relative to those from the generally less
   productive WAP and Drake Passage. Zooplankton delta C-13 values
   decreased by 3\% from north of the Polar Front (-24.2 +/- 0.9\%) to the
   Ross Sea (-27.5 +/- 1.6\%), likely driven by decreasing sea surface
   temperatures with increasing latitude. Our isoscapes are a valuable
   first step in establishing isotopic spatial patterns in West Antarctica
   and are critical for addressing numerous ecosystem questions.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",Article,English,"Brault, EK (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.

   and nitrogen stable isotope signatures of Alaskan sockeye salmon",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,2012,460,NA,155-167,NA,"Broad-scale shifts in climate during the 20th century had large effects
   on the ecology of the North Pacific Ocean, including a substantial
   change in the composition of the dominant food web. Salmon production in
   Alaskan stocks increased with a concurrent shift of the Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation in 1977. Salmon production has since been persistently high
   through 2010, yet the biological mechanisms for this increase in
   production remain unclear. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of
   sockeye salmon scales collected from 8 rivers in Bristol Bay between
   1964 and 2003 were analyzed to assess whether the trophic ecology of
   these fish changed systematically over this period, during which there
   were substantial changes in oceanographic conditions. Isotope values
   were remarkably stable over the study despite substantial changes in
   salmon production and oceanographic conditions in this region. Our
   results also suggest river-specific patterns in the variation of stable
   isotopes through time; stable isotope changes were related to stock
   identity and showed some geographic organization. Larger salmon tended
   to have depleted delta N-15 and delta C-13. Isotopic characteristics
   among rivers became more variable during the period of high ocean
   productivity (after the 1977 regime shift and before the 1989 regime
   shift). Some of the dominant signals of variation in stable isotope
   variation were related to important environmental physical processes,
   but they appear to have unique effects on the isotopic characteristics
   of stocks from different rivers, suggesting important connections
   between the ecology of sockeye salmon in freshwater and in the ocean.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",Article,English,"Johnson, SP (Corresponding Author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat \& Fisheries Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.

   a benthic prey assemblage",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,2014,514,NA,163-174,NOV 6,"Invasive organisms can have significant impacts on native species, and
   the San Francisco Estuary (SFE), California, USA, is one of the world's
   most invaded estuaries. Decline of native white sturgeon Acipenser
   transmontanus abundance in the SFE has been acknowledged, but underlying
   mechanisms are poorly understood. Invasion by the overbite clam
   Potamocorbula amurensis has drastically altered the SFE benthic prey
   community, yet little is known about how this change has affected
   sturgeon diets. We investigated changes in the diet of white sturgeon
   following the overbite clam invasion and subsequent shift in the SFE
   benthic prey assemblage. Gut content analysis was used to compare white
   sturgeon prey composition and importance between the pre- and
   post-invasion periods. Additionally, stable isotope analysis was
   employed to estimate the assimilation of prey items to sturgeon biomass.
   Overbite clams dominated diets in the post-invasion period, accounting
   for 82 to 93\% of total volume. Stable isotope analysis confirmed the
   importance of this prey item, although their assimilated contribution to
   sturgeon biomass was estimated to be less (70 to 83\%) than gut contents
   indicated. The frequency of fish in white sturgeon guts increased in the
   post-invasion period, and isotope analysis indicated relatively large
   contributions of fish to sturgeon biomass (3.7 to 19\%). The trophic
   adaptability of white sturgeon has allowed them to exploit this new prey
   source (overbite clam). Future conservation and restoration efforts must
   consider a potentially destabilized food web given the large importance

   developed as a proxy for reconstructing terrestrial paleoenvironments.
   However, our understanding of exactly how accurately these isotope
   compositions reflect seasonal variations remains limited. Here, we
   present a study of modern guano of phytophagous bats collected monthly
   over a one-year period at two roosting sites in Guadeloupe. The aim is
   to assess the degree to which seasonal climate and environmental
   variations are reflected in carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions
   from bat guano, as well as to evaluate the potential use of guano from
   phytophagous bats as a paleoenvironmental record. Our results show that
   stable isotope compositions vary locally, suggesting that guano of
   phytophagous bats accurately records local environmental conditions.
   Additionally, stable isotope compositions reflect seasonal variations
   influencing bat diet that lead to modifications of up to 2\%, of the
   carbon isotope compositions from feces. However, these variations are
   not correlated solely with climate variables as there is no
   straightforward relationship between climate, vegetation and bat diet
   over a one-year period. Moreover, these seasonal variations drive one of
   the bat colonies to occasionally consume insects, which can be traced as
   a seasonal shift in \%N (up to 4.5\%) and carbon isotope compositions
   (up to 5.6 parts per thousand). Seasonal changes in isotope compositions
   are still lower than expected variations from fossil feces, confirming
   the potential use of feces from phytophagous bats as a reliable
   paleoenvironmental proxy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Royer, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Bordeaux, PACEA UMR CNRS 5199, Allee Geoffroy St Hilaire,CS 50 023, F-33615 Pessac, France.

   South Africa",AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,2022,47,7,1480-1494,NOV,"Trophic niche analysis can be used to assess ecological opportunities
   available to alien species in areas of introduction that might aid their
   establishment, define their functional role and inform on their
   potential impacts. This study assessed the trophic niche utilized by an
   invasive population of the Australian redclaw crayfish, Cherax
   quadricarinatus, in the Inkomati River Basin, South Africa. It evaluated
   the hypothesis that the euryphagous feeding strategy of redclaw crayfish
   may allow it to shift its niche width and niche position by altering its
   feeding strategy in response to fluctuations in resource availability.
   Gut content and stable isotope analyses were used to determine trophic
   niche and trophic interactions. Redclaw crayfish were shown to be
   omnivores and their diet consisted mainly of algae, plant material and
   invertebrates. Small-sized individuals had a constricted niche width and
   fed primarily on invertebrates, whereas larger individuals expanded
   their niche width to include larger proportions of plant material.
   Crayfish caught from lotic environments had a higher proportion of
   invertebrates in their diet than crayfish from lentic environments, and
   the species exploited a wider niche in summer than in winter. These
   differences are likely related to differences in productivity amongst
   habitats and fluctuations in resource availability. There was
   significant niche overlap (>60\%) between redclaw crayfish and Sidney's
   river crab (Potamonautes sidneyi), but not with other native
   invertebrates. Both species are omnivores and have similar functional
   roles, possibly making redclaw crayfish functionally redundant in this
   ecosystem. Even though both species mainly feed on resources (plant
   material and invertebrates) that are not normally limiting, the redclaw
   crayfish invasion might be an accelerator of ecosystem processes such as
   shredding and decomposition rates of plant material. There is,
   therefore, a need for further studies to examine potentially altered
   ecosystem functions caused by redclaw crayfish invasion in the Inkomati

   both ancient and modern marine species from the Beagle Channel were used
   to compare the structure of Late Holocene and modern food webs, and
   predict potential changes as a result of a Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
   increase in the region. Complementary, ancient and modern shells of
   limpets and mussels were isotopically analysed to explore changes in the
   isotopic baseline and compare marine food webs through time after an
   appropriate correction for baseline shifts. Results confirmed a
   declining pattern of marine primary productivity during the Late
   Holocene in the Beagle Channel. In general, the isotopic niches
   overlapped largely in the ancient food web in comparison to the current
   marine one, with the exception of that of cormorants (Phalacrocorax
   sp.). Our data suggest that all the species that have undergone intense
   human exploitation (Arctocephalus australis, Otaria flavescens and
   Merluccius sp.) significantly increased their trophic levels. The most
   important finding of this work was the very high isotopic overlap
   between snoek (Thyrsites atun) and hake (Merluccius sp.) during the Late
   Holocene. Increasing SST as a result of global warming could favour the
   recolonization of the southern South-Western Atlantic Ocean by snoek
   from the South-Eastern Pacific Ocean, with a potential impact on the

   Front in the Danube River",PLOS ONE,2013,8,9,NA,SEP 9,"Few studies have systematically investigated differences in performance,
   morphology and parasitic load of invaders at different stages of an
   invasion. This study analyzed phenotype-environment correlations in a
   fish invasion from initial absence until establishment in the headwater
   reach of the second largest European river, the Danube. Here, the round
   goby (Neogobius melanostomus) formed 73\% of the fish abundance and 58\%
   of the fish biomass in rip-rap bank habitats after establishment. The
   time from invasion until establishment was only about two years,
   indicating rapid expansion. Founder populations from the invasion front
   were different from longer established round goby populations in
   demography, morphology, feeding behaviour, sex ratio and parasitic load,
   indicating that plasticity in these traits determines invasion success.
   Competitive ability was mostly dependent on growth/size-related traits
   rather than on fecundity. As revealed by stable isotope analyses,
   specimens at the invasion front had a higher trophic position in the
   food web and seem to benefit from lower food competition. Somatic
   performance seems to be more important than investment in reproduction
   during the early stages of the invasion process and upstream-directed
   range expansion is not caused by out-migrating weak or juvenile
   individuals that were forced to leave high density areas due to high
   competition. This mechanism might be true for downstream introductions
   via drift. Greater abundance and densities of acanthocephalan
   endoparasites were observed at the invasion front, which contradicts the
   expectation that invasion success is determined by lower parasitic
   pressure in newly invaded areas. Overall, the pronounced changes in fish
   and invertebrate communities with a dominance of alien species suggest
   invasional meltdown and a shift of the upper Danube River towards a
   novel ecosystem with species that have greater resistance to goby
   predation. This seems to contribute to overcoming biological resistance

   Europe during the Holocene",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,2019,25,9,2915-2930,SEP,"Climate warming and human landscape transformation during the Holocene
   resulted in environmental changes for wild animals. The last remnants of
   the European Pleistocene megafauna that survived into the Holocene were
   particularly vulnerable to changes in habitat. To track the response of
   habitat use and foraging of large herbivores to natural and
   anthropogenic changes in environmental conditions during the Holocene,
   we investigated carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable
   isotope composition in bone collagen of moose (Alces alces), European
   bison (Bison bonasus) and aurochs (Bos primigenius) in Central and
   Eastern Europe. We found strong variations in isotope compositions in
   the studied species throughout the Holocene and diverse responses to
   changing environmental conditions. All three species showed significant
   changes in their delta C-13 values reflecting a shift of foraging
   habitats from more open in the Early and pre-Neolithic Holocene to more
   forest during the Neolithic and Late Holocene. This shift was strongest
   in European bison, suggesting higher plasticity, more limited in moose,
   and the least in aurochs. Significant increases of delta N-15 values in
   European bison and moose are evidence of a diet change towards more
   grazing, but may also reflect increased nitrogen in soils following
   deglaciation and global temperature increases. Among the factors
   explaining the observed isotope variations were time (age of samples),
   longitude and elevation in European bison, and time, longitude and
   forest cover in aurochs. None of the analysed factors explained isotope
   variations in moose. Our results demonstrate the strong influence of
   natural (forest expansion) and anthropogenic (deforestation and human
   pressure) changes on the foraging ecology of large herbivores, with
   forests playing a major role as a refugial habitat since the Neolithic,
   particularly for European bison and aurochs. We propose that high
   flexibility in foraging strategy was the key for survival of large
   herbivores in the changing environmental conditions of the Holocene.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Hofman-Kaminska, E (Corresponding Author), Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, Stoczek 1, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland.

   stability of a shallow benthic food web from a high-Arctic fjord exposed
   to freshwater inputs",LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,2021,66,"1, SI",S259-S272,JAN,"Under climate change, many Arctic coastal ecosystems receive increasing
   amounts of freshwater, with ecological consequences that remain poorly
   understood. In this study, we investigated how freshwater inputs may
   affect the small-scale structure of benthic food webs in a
   low-production high-Arctic fjord (Young Sound, NE Greenland). We
   seasonally sampled benthic invertebrates from two stations receiving
   contrasting freshwater inputs: an inner station exposed to turbid and
   nutrient-depleted freshwater flows and an outer station exposed to lower
   terrestrial influences. Benthic food web structure was described using a
   stable isotope approach (delta C-13 and delta N-15), Bayesian models,
   and community-wide metrics. The results revealed the spatially and
   temporally homogeneous structure of the benthic food web, characterized
   by high trophic diversity (i.e., a wide community isotopic niche). Such
   temporal stability and spatial homogeneity mirrors the high degree of
   trophic plasticity and omnivory of benthic consumers that allows the
   maintenance of several carbon pathways through the food web despite
   different food availability. Furthermore, potential large inputs of
   shelf organic matter together with local benthic primary production
   (i.e., macroalgae and presumably microphytobenthos) may considerably
   increase the stability of the benthic food web by providing alternative
   food sources to locally runoff-impacted pelagic primary production.
   Future studies should assess beyond which threshold limit a larger
   increase in freshwater inputs might cancel out these stability factors
   and lead to marked changes in Arctic benthic ecosystems.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Bridier, G (Corresponding Author), CNRS, Lab Sci Environm Marin LEMAR, UMR 6539, UBO,IRD,Ifremer, Plouzane, France.

   by large terrestrial herbivores: A stable isotope approach",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2018,63,11,1365-1380,NOV,"1. Knowledge of trophic structure is important to understand sources and
   pathways of energy resources in community ecology and to identify
   determinants of ecosystem changes. Yet, little is known from rivers of
   African savanna receiving large inputs of terrestrial organic matter and
   nutrients by large mammalian herbivores.
   2. We used Stable Isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) Bayesian Ellipses
   in R (SIBER) and Layman's community-wide metrics to describe seasonal
   variation in trophic niches and trophic structures in midorder river
   reaches in the Mara River (Kenya) that differed in environmental
   conditions (agricultural vs. forested) and amounts of organic matter and
   nutrients (low vs. high inputs by livestock and hippopotami,
   Hippopotamus amphibius). These analyses were supplemented with data on
   the trophic diversity of macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups
   (FFGs) and fish trophic guilds.
   3. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 of basal resources and consumers
   differed between sites and changed with seasons. Sites in agricultural
   areas that were utilised by livestock and a site with hippopotami had
   higher delta C-13 than the forested site due to the presence of C4
   carbon from egestion and excretion by the grazers.
   4. The forested site recorded the most taxon-rich and trophic-diverse
   invertebrate community, suggesting both autochthonous and allochthonous
   sources of energy were available. Agricultural sites and the site with
   hippopotami recorded high abundances of collector taxa in response to
   large inputs of organic matter. Fish trophic guilds were less diverse
   and were dominated by insectivores.
   5. The food web at the forested site had the widest trophic niche size
   and highest isotopic trophic diversity compared to sites in areas with
   large mammalian herbivores. Invertebrate and fish trophic niche sizes
   changed according to food resources varying with space and time.
   Invertebrates had higher delta C-13 values during the dry season. In
   contrast, fish showed higher delta C-13 values during the wet season,
   and trophic niche sizes were constricted and considerably overlapping,
   suggesting feeding on a narrow range of food sources with high trophic
   redundancy.
   6. This study showed that increased terrestrial organic matter by large
   mammalian herbivores affected trophic diversity and niche sizes for
   aquatic consumers in rivers draining the African savanna. Linking the
   density of terrestrial large mammalian herbivores to aquatic ecosystem
   structure and function could help manage their populations sustainably.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Masese, FO (Corresponding Author), Univ Eldoret, Dept Fisheries \& Aquat Sci, POB 1125, Eldoret 30100, Kenya.

   are known to impair the structure and functioning of both pelagic and
   benthic compartments. However, the manner in which eutrophication
   triggers a series of cascade effects in the whole food web in coastal
   lagoons has received little attention. Using stable isotope (SI)
   analyses, we investigated the food web structure in the hypertrophic
   lagoon of Yundang (Xiamen, China) in two periods of the year
   characterized by the recurrent alternation of Ulva lactuca and
   phytoplankton blooms in the cool (March) and warm (September) seasons,
   respectively. Large temporal fluctuations in the dominance of primary
   producers (i.e. macroalgae vs. phytoplankton) and, thus, in the
   available food items, were reflected in major changes in the diet and SI
   signals of several primary consumers, such as the amphipod
   Grandidierella japonica, the polychaetes Neanthes japonica and Capitella
   capitata, and omnivorous fishes (i.e. Mugil cephalus, Oreochromis
   niloticus, and Sardinella zunasi), while these changes were limited in
   top carnivorous fishes, such as Lateolabrax japonicas. Furthermore,
   reduced macrozoobenthic abundance available for omnivores in September
   was found to force omnivores to switch their feeding habits to those of
   herbivores. The present study provides evidence that the periodical
   alternation of macroalgal and phytoplankton blooms throughout the year
   strongly affect the relations among different trophic levels leading to
   a cascading effect across the whole food web and to major changes in the
   lagoon's food web structure. Importantly, our study shows that the
   lagoon's food web structure under persistent eutrophic conditions can
   still cope with seasonal changes in primary energy source type from
   macroalgae to microalgae due to the ability of omnivorous fishes to
   conduit different food sources up to the highest trophic levels. Thus,
   this study suggests that in such a highly variable eutrophic system,
   omnivores play a central role in the lagoon's functioning, and help to
   sustain the biological resources and the ecosystem services provided by
   the lagoon.",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Huang, LF (Corresponding Author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Environm \& Ecol, Minist Educ Coastal \& Wetland Ecosyst, Key Lab, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China.

   through alterations in the structure and function of its food webs.
   Insights into the nature of food web change and its ecological
   ramifications can be obtained through the monitoring of high trophic
   level predators such as aquatic birds. Often, food web change involves
   alterations in the relative abundance of constituent species and/or the
   introduction of new species (exotic invaders). Diet composition of
   aquatic birds is influenced, in part, by relative prey availability and
   therefore is a sensitive measure of food web structure. Using bird diet
   data to make inferences regarding food web change requires consistent
   measures of diet composition through time. This can be accomplished by
   measuring stable chemical and/or biochemical ecological tracers in
   archived avian samples. Such tracers provide insights into pathways of
   energy and nutrient transfer. In this study, we examine the utility of
   two groups of naturally-occurring intrinsic tracers (stable isotopes and
   fatty acids) to provide such information in a predatory seabird, the
   herring gull (Larus argentatus). Retrospective stable nitrogen and
   carbon isotope analysis of archived herring gull eggs identified
   declines in gull trophic position and shifts in food sources in Lake
   Huron over the last 25 years and changes in gull diet composition were
   inferred from egg fatty acid patterns. These independent groups of
   ecological tracers provided corroborating evidence of dietary change in
   this high trophic level predator. Gull dietary shifts were related to
   declines in prey fish abundance which suggests large-scale alterations
   to the Lake Huron ecosystem. Dietary shifts in herring gulls may be
   contributing to reductions in resources available for egg formation.
   Further research is required to evaluate how changes in resource
   availability may affect population sustainability in herring gulls and
   other waterbird species. Long-term biological monitoring programs are

   which the top predator consumes both a competitor (consumer) and a
   second prey that it shares with the competitor. This omnivorous
   configuration occurs frequently in food webs, but theory suggests that
   it is unstable unless stabilizing mechanisms exist that can decrease the
   strength of the omnivore and consumer interaction. Although these
   mechanisms have been documented in native food webs, little is known
   about whether they operate in the context of an introduced species.
   Here, we study a marine mussel aquaculture system where the introduction
   of omnivorous mussels should generate an unstable food web that favors
   the extinction of the consumer, yet it persists. Using field and
   laboratory approaches, we searched for stabilizing mechanisms that could
   reduce interaction strengths in the food web. While field zooplankton
   counts suggested that mussels influence the composition and abundance of
   copepods, stable isotope results indicated that life-history omnivory
   and cannibalism facilitated the availability of prey refugia, and
   reduced competition and the interaction strength between the mussel
   omnivore and zooplankton consumers. In laboratory experiments, however,
   we found no evidence of adaptive feeding which could weaken
   predator-consumer interactions. Our food web study suggests that the
   impact of an introduced omnivore may not only depend on its interaction
   with native species but also on the availability of stabilizing

   focusing on the restoration and rehabilitation of self-sustaining native
   fish communities. Such efforts have not traditionally adopted an
   ecosystem-based perspective, which considers species as embedded within
   a broader food web context. In this study, we quantify food web changes
   in Lake Tahoe (California-Nevada) over the last century based on stable
   isotope analysis of museum-archived, preserved fish specimens collected
   during 4 historical periods and under present conditions. We also
   examine the contemporary food web of nearby Cascade Lake, which is free
   from most exotic species and contains a species assemblage resembling
   that of Lake Tahoe prior to historical species introductions. During the
   last century, the freshwater shrimp Mysis relicta and lake trout
   (Salvelinus namay-cush) have been introduced and established in Lake
   Tahoe, and the native top predator, Lahontan cutthroat trout
   (Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi; hereafter LCT), has been extirpated.
   Isotope analysis indicates that lake trout now occupy a trophic niche
   similar to that of historical LCT. Fish production has shifted from
   benthic to pelagic, corresponding with the eutrophication of Lake Tahoe
   during recent decades. The current Cascade Lake food web resembles that
   of the historical Lake Tahoe food web. Our isotope-based food web
   reconstructions reveal long-term food web changes in Lake Tahoe and can
   serve as the basis for setting historically relevant restoration
   targets. Unfortunately, the presence of normative species, particularly
   Mysis and lake trout, have dramatically altered the pelagic food web
   structure; as such, they are barriers to native fish community
   restoration. Fish community restoration efforts should focus on adjacent
   ecosystems, such as Cascade Lake, which have a high likelihood of
   success because they have not been heavily affected by normative
   introductions.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Article,English,"Vander Zanden, MJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Limnol, 680 N Pk St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

   and trophic position in eutrophic coastal ecosystems",ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE,2022,79,8,2311-2323,OCT 26,"In coastal marine food webs, food chain length and the distribution of
   trophic levels mediate the impacts of emerging threats such as
   overfishing, pollution, and climate change, through their effect on
   essential properties such as productivity, connectivity, and energy
   transfer efficiency. These two components of food web structure are
   therefore an essential element of ecosystem-based management; however,
   what drives them remains poorly understood. It has been hypothesized
   that high primary production drives lower trophic levels and shorter
   food chain length in coastal regions. Here, we evaluate this hypothesis
   on the British Columbia (BC) coast as this coastal marine ecosystem is
   comprised of regions with contrasting levels of primary production. We
   measured nitrogen stable isotopes from zooplankton, micronekton, and
   nekton collected from four of the main water bodies of southern BC
   during a survey completed in August of 2019. We used Sentinel-3
   satellite data to determine overall production in each region across a
   5-year climatology and during the 2019 season. Results showed that
   primary production varied significantly between the four regions and
   that increases in phytoplankton biomass were driven by increases in
   microphytoplankton. Nitrogen isotope data demonstrated a significant
   inverse relationship between a region's primary production and both
   total food chain length and trophic level in species sampled in multiple
   regions, but no change in the trophic structure of the zooplankton
   community across regions. Changes in species' trophic levels were
   therefore driven by shifts in the level of zooplanktivory. These results
   support a model of bottom-up omnivory driving coastal food web
   structure, where levels of primary production, specifically biomass of
   microphytoplankton, determine food chain length and the distribution of
   trophic levels. High microphytoplankton biomass supports a large biomass
   of large grazing zooplankton, which drive increases in omnivorous
   feeding behaviour among the micronekton and nekton.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Lerner, JE (Corresponding Author), Univ British Columbia, Inst Oceans \& Fisheries, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.

   in human-modified landscapes for many vertebrate species. Such resources
   can alter individual foraging behavior of animals, and induce
   population-wide changes. Yet, little consensus exists about the relative
   influence of the availabilities of native and human food subsidies to
   wildlife foraging throughout altered landscapes. We explored this
   unresolved question by analyzing the effects of landscape factors on
   American black bear (Ursus americanus) diet across the state of
   Colorado, USA. We estimated assimilated diet using stable isotope
   analysis of harvested black bear tissues to determine the contribution
   of human-derived foods to bear diets throughout Colorado, as well as how
   increasing reliance on human-derived food subsidies increases the risk
   of conflict. We found that bears (n = 296) showed strong regional diet
   variability, but substantial use of human-derived food subsidies in
   eastern Colorado (>30\% assimilated diet). The age-sex class of the bear
   and housing density of its harvest location were the most influential
   predictors of C-13 enrichment (a tracer of human food subsidies).
   Furthermore, foraging on subsidies increased risk of conflict; the odds
   of being a nuisance bear increased by 60\% for each similar to 1 parts
   per thousand increase in delta C-13. Our study confirms the efficacy of
   delta C-13 as a proxy for human activity, and indicates that while
   demographic differences play a clear role in the foraging ecology of
   bears, availability of subsidies coincident with varying levels of human
   activity appears to be a major driver in predicting black bear diet

   trophic interactions and the flow of energy through food webs in the

   function to specific anthropogenic stressors in the alpine stream
   systems remain unclear. Here, we studied the stream food webs in the

   ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of macroinvertebrate and fish
   functional feeding groups (FFGs) and their basal resources in the
   streams. Dietary contributions of basal resources to consumers and food
   web metrics including trophic length, diversity, and redundancy were
   used to quantify changes in stream food webs in response to
   anthropogenic disturbance. Dietary analysis showed that allochthonous
   resources contributed more than autochthonous resources to
   macroinvertebrate primary consumers regardless of the disturbance
   intensity in the adjacent land areas. Anthropogenic activities increased
   the delta N-15 values in epilithic algae and isotopic variation in basal
   resources and fish but reduced the trophic length and redundancy (i.e.,
   fewer species or taxon at each trophic level) in food webs.
   Additionally, the total nitrogen concentration in waters was the most

   expected with climate change will influence the fate of organic matter
   within northern peatlands. The goals of this study were to (1) document
   spatial and temporal variability in the contribution of periphyton to
   peatland food webs using isotope analysis (C-13 and N-15), and (2)
   quantify the influence of increased nutrient availability on primary and
   secondary production across a gradient of rich, moderate, and poor fen
   peatlands common to the northern boreal biome. We established replicate
   m(2) plots within each fen located in interior Alaska to quantify
   periphyton (algae and bacteria) and macroinvertebrate biomass with and
   without nutrient addition throughout a growing season (May-August).
   Stable isotope analysis showed that periphyton contributed x = 65\% of
   organic matter to the food web over time and across fens compared to x =
   7\% from plants or detritus. The transfer of basal resources was
   reflected in an increase in herbivore biomass as algal biomass increased
   over time in all fens, followed by an increase in predatory
   macroinvertebrates during the latter part of the growing season.
   Furthermore, all measures of periphyton and macroinvertebrate biomass
   were enhanced by nutrient addition. These data provide insight into
   patterns of natural variation within the aquatic food web of boreal
   peatlands and show that basal resources within this ecosystem, which are
   generally considered to be ``detritus-based,{''} are actually driven by

   a case study from the Vestfold Hills",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,2013,478,NA,27+,NA,"Shallow-water benthic communities throughout coastal Antarctica share
   many species and are governed by similar physico-oceanographic
   processes. This suggests community structure and function may be similar
   among communities despite being geographically separated by up to 15
   degrees of latitude and 18 000 km of coastline. To test this theory, we
   developed a food web model using stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta
   N-15) for the high-latitude Vestfold Hills shallow-water benthic
   community and compared it to the isotopic food web model developed for
   the Windmill Islands, located over 1000 km away. For the Vestfold Hills
   food web, carbon sources were generally well separated by delta C-13,
   and lower-order consumers could be grouped according to their feeding
   guild and main dietary sources as determined by delta C-13 and delta
   N-15. Higher-order consumers occupied the full range of delta C-13
   ratios and had similar delta N-15 values, although predators were
   weakly, but significantly, enriched in delta N-15 compared to
   scavenger/predators and omnivores. When comparing with the Windmill
   Islands food web, we found similar delta C-13 ratios for several
   co-occurring carbon sources and consumers, whilst the delta N-15 ratios
   in consumers from the Vestfold Hills were consistently enriched compared
   to those from the Windmill Islands by 1 to 2 parts per thousand. The
   relative positions of feeding guilds on the delta C-13 and delta N-15
   planes were similar for both food webs. These results suggest there is
   considerable merit in developing a representative food web model for
   Antarctic shallow-water communities. Such a model would provide a

   Greenland subarctic streams",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2014,59,9,1830-1842,SEP,"1. Climate warming in (sub) arctic regions is expected to increase
   freshwater fish overwinter survival and dispersal, potentially with
   strong implications for macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and
   ecosystem processes. Several studies worldwide have shown large effects
   of top predators (usually fish) on macroinvertebrates in streams.
   However, the influence of top predators on trophic diversity, the range
   of food resources exploited and trophic niche redundancy is less well
   studied, particularly in cold regions.
   2. Using stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15) and fish gut content analysis,
   we investigated the effect of top predators on macroinvertebrate food
   webs in streams in Greenland by comparing adjacent sites with and
   without fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus).
   3. Food-web metrics estimated from stable isotope data showed that the
   presence of fish reduced the diversity of food sources exploited by
   macroinvertebrates as well as their trophic diversity. In addition, fish
   presence increased packing and trophic redundancy of macroinvertebrate
   taxa in the food web, possibly due to behavioural changes in foraging
   activity. Furthermore, predatory macroinvertebrate taxa were unable to
   attain the trophic position of fish so that food webs were one trophic
   level longer in streams with fish. Focusing on macroinvertebrate food
   webs alone, predatory macroinvertebrates did not change their trophic
   position in the presence of fish.
   4. Filter feeders dominated the macroinvertebrate assemblage when fish
   were present, while the relative abundance of collector-gatherers was
   marginally higher in the fishless streams. This pattern was consistent
   with stronger selectivity for collector-gatherers by fish.
   5. Climate-driven fish colonisation in currently fishless Greenland
   streams may induce a shift in macroinvertebrate food webs, with a
   reduction in both trophic diversity and the variety of food sources
   consumed. To some extent, this might counteract a change towards a
   broader use of food resources by macroinvertebrates that might otherwise
   be expected at higher temperatures. In addition, a shift in the
   macroinvertebrate assemblage towards dominance of filter feeders can be
   expected to promote an increase in periphyton biomass in streams with
   fish.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"González-Bergonzoni, I (Corresponding Author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Vejlsovej 25, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark.

   facilitate major changes in the ecology of lakes. In Lake Wanaka, a
   large alpine New Zealand lake, the macrophytes Lagarosiphon major and
   Elodea canadensis (Hydrocharitaceae) have invaded parts of the lake
   where they form tall dense plant beds throughout mid-depths (2-7 m) of
   the littoral zone. We investigated differences in plants, benthic
   invertebrates, fish, and food webs characterizing native and exotic
   plant beds in mid-depths of the littoral zone. The 3X higher plant
   biomass and 2X higher plant surface area in exotic than in native plant
   beds (quillworts, milfoils, and charophytes) contributed to greater
   standing stocks and productivity of epiphyton in the exotic plant beds.
   Invertebrate communities were less dense (1890/m(2) vs 4030/m(2)) and
   less diverse (richness = 9 vs 12) in native than in exotic plant beds
   because of differences in biomass, productivity, and physical structure
   of native and exotic plant communities. Invertebrate communities in
   native beds were dominated by snails, oligochaetes, and nematodes,
   whereas chironomids, snails, and caddisflies were dominant in exotic
   beds. Stable isotope signatures (C-13 and N-15) and dietary analyses
   indicated that Potamopyrgus antipodarum, the dominant invertebrate taxon
   in both bed types, consumed mostly epiphyton. In native beds,
   consumption of sedimentary fine benthic organic matter by oligochaetes
   and nematodes made significant contributions to C flow, whereas, in
   exotic beds, consumption of epiphyton by grazers (e.g., snails,
   caddisflies, and chironomids) was an important pathway for C flow.
   Macrophytes made only small contributions to C flow in either bed type.
   The dominant native fish in Lake Wanaka, the bully Gobiomorphus
   cotidianus, was more abundant in exotic than in native beds, but bully
   predation rates on snails were significantly lower in exotic than in
   native beds. Invasion by adventive macrophyte species can cause

   impact Arctic food webs remains a challenge in forecasting ecological
   responses to climate change. One top-down approach to this challenge is
   to elucidate trophic roles of consumers as either specialists (i.e.,
   consumers of predominantly one food resource) or generalists (i.e.,
   consumers of multiple food resources) to categorize the dependence of
   consumers on each primary producer. At Hanna Shoal in the Chukchi Sea,
   Alaska, we used stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data to quantify
   trophic redundancy with standard ellipse areas at both the species and
   trophic guild levels. We also investigated species-level trophic
   plasticity by analyzing the varying extents that three end-members were
   assimilated by the food web using the mixing model simmr (Stable Isotope
   Mixing Model in R). Our results showed that ice algae, a combined
   phytoplankton and sediment organic matter composite (PSOM), and a
   hypothesized microphytobenthos (MPB) component were incorporated by
   consumers in the benthic food web, but their importance varied by
   species. Some primary consumers relied heavily on PSOM (e.g, the
   amphipods Ampelisca sp. and Byblis sp.; the copepod Calanus sp.), while
   others exhibited generalist feeding and obtained nutrition from multiple
   sources (e.g., the holothuroidean Ocnus glacialis, the gastropod
   Tachyrhynchus sp., the sipunculid Golfingia margaritacea, and the
   bivalves Ennucula tenths, Nuculana pernula, Macoma sp., and Yoldia
   hyperborea). Most higher trophic level benthic predators, including the
   gastropods Buccinum sp., Cryptonatica affinis, and Neptunea sp, the
   seastar Leptasterias groenlandica, and the amphipod Anonyx sp. also
   exhibited trophic plasticity by coupling energy pathways from multiple
   primary producers including PSOM, ice algae, and MPB. Our stable isotope
   data indicate that consumers in the Hanna Shoal food web exhibit
   considerable trophic redundancy, while few species were specialists and
   assimilated only one end-member. Although most consumers were capable of
   obtaining nutrition from multiple food sources, the timing, quantity,
   and quality of ice-mediated primary production may still have pronounced

   isotopes: Current progress and future challenges",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,2023,904,NA,NA,DEC 15,"Dams have disrupted natural river systems worldwide and although
   population and community level effects on aquatic biota have been well
   documented, food web responses remain poorly understood and difficult to
   char-acterize. The application of stable isotope analysis (SIA) provides
   a means to assess the effect of dams on food webs. Here we review the
   effect of dams on aquatic food webs using SIA, aiming to detect
   knowledge gaps in the field of dam impacts on aquatic food webs and
   propose a conceptual framework to help formulate hypotheses about dam
   impacts on food webs guided by food web theory. Dams can affect aquatic
   food webs via two pathways: a bottom-up pathway with altered basal food
   sources and their transfer to consumers through changes in flow,
   nutrients, temperature and sediment, and a top-down pathway with
   consumer species composition altered mainly through habitat
   fragmentation and related physiochemical changes. Taking these
   mechanisms into consideration, the impact of dams on food web attributes
   derived from SIA was evaluated. These studies generally apply mixing
   models to determine how dams alter the dominant carbon sources
   supporting food webs, use delta 15N to examine how dams alter food-chain
   length, or use Layman metrics of isotope variability to assess niche
   changes for invertebrate and fish assemblages. Most studies compare the
   patterns of SIA metrics spatially (e.g. upstream vs reservoir vs
   downstream of dams; regulated vs unregulated rivers) and temporally
   (before vs after dam construction), without explicit hypotheses and/or
   links to theoretical concepts of food webs. We propose several steps to
   make SIA studies of dam impacts more rigorous and enhance their
   potential for pro-ducing novel insights. Future studies should quantify
   the shape and strength of the effect of dams on SIA-measured food web
   response, be conducted at larger temporal and spatial scales
   (particularly along the river longitudinal continuum and the lateral
   connected ecosystems (e.g., floodplains)), and consider effects of dams
   on food web resilience and tipping points.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Guo, F (Corresponding Author), Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Ecol Environm \& Resources, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Water Qual Improvement \& Ec, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.

   residues by the soil micro-food web",PLANT AND SOIL,2018,429,"1-2, SI",335-348,AUG,"Background and aims Crop residue decomposition is a major component of
   carbon (C) cycling and provides energy and nutrients to the soil
   micro-food web. An in-situ field experiment was conducted to examine how
   exogenous organic C is incorporated into the soil micro-food web and how
   this is influenced by four different fertilization treatments: organic
   manure (M), urea fertilizer (U), the combined application of organic and
   urea fertilizer (MU) and unfertilized control.
   Methods The amount of C-13-enriched maize remained was traced in
   microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and in different trophic
   groups of the soil nematode community after a 183-day decomposition
   period.
   Results The fertilization type influenced the incorporation of residue
   into the microbial community. Soil bacterial and fungal PLFAs utilized
   the least C-13-labeled crop residues in the U treatment. Both the
   nematode bacterial and the fungal pathways utilized more crop residues
   in the M treatment than in other treatments.
   Conclusions Given the ecological services provided by the soil
   organisms, our results suggest that long-term manure application
   increases the soil C pool directly. This also leads to more C from crop
   residues utilized by the soil food web, which in turn, can benefit crop
   growth or C accumulation in agroecosystems.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Liang, WJ; Li, Q (Corresponding Author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China.

   trophic structure of the subtidal food web around the Mingan Islands,
   northern Gulf of St. Lawrence, eastern Canada. All benthic consumers
   were enriched in (13)C (mean delta(13)C of -17.1 parts per thousand)
   compared to particulate organic matter (POM: -23.3 parts per thousand).
   Nitrogen stable isotope ratios ranged from 6 parts per thousand to 14
   parts per thousand and the organisms studied fell into three distinct
   trophic groups, primary producers, primary consumers (herbivores), and
   predators. The sea star Crossaster papposus and the sculpin
   Myoxocephalus scorpius, known to be top level predators, had slightly
   higher delta(15)N than other predators. Although the average isotope
   signature of the sea star Solaster endeca placed it among regular
   predators, the delta(15)N increased with sea star size and large
   individuals could be considered as top predators. The relatively small
   number of organisms located at intermediate trophic levels suggests a
   low level of omnivory in the Mingan Islands' system, which contrasts
   with previously described benthic systems that exhibit a continuum
   between herbivores and predators. Low omnivory, in addition to low
   diversity, suggests that this ecosystem may be relatively unstable if
   exposed to natural and/or anthropogenic disturbances such as
   exploitation and climate change.",EDP SCIENCES S A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A,

   HABITAT-SPECIFIC FORAGING",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,2008,18,"8, SI",A196-A212,DEC,"Mercury (Hg) trophic transfer and bioaccumulation in fish from a
   mine-impacted, eutrophic lake were examined in relation to foraging
   habitat, trophic position, and size. Diet analysis indicated that there
   were clear ontogenetic shifts in foraging habitats and trophic position.
   Pelagic diet decreased and benthic diet increased with increasing fish
   length in bluegill, black crappie, inland silverside, and largemouth
   bass, whereas there was no shift for prickly sculpin or threadfin shad.
   Stable carbon isotope values (delta C-13) were inversely related to the
   proportion of pelagic prey items in the diet, but there was no clear
   relationship with benthic foraging. There were distinct differences
   between pelagic and benthic prey basal delta C-13 values, with a range
   of approximately -28 parts per thousand in pelagic zooplankton to
   approximately -20 parts per thousand in benthic caddisflies. Profundal
   prey such as chironomid larvae had intermediate delta C-13 values of
   approximately -24 parts per thousand, reflecting the influence of
   pelagic detrital subsidies and suppressing the propagation of the
   benthic carbon isotope signal up the food chain. Fish total mercury
   (TotHg) concentrations varied with habitat-specific foraging, trophic
   position, and size; however, the relationships differed among species
   and ages. When controlling for the effects of species, length, and
   trophic position, TotHg and delta C-13 were positively correlated,
   indicating that Hg trophic transfer is linked to benthic foraging. When
   examined on a species-specific basis, TotHg was positively correlated
   with delta C-13 only for bluegill, largemouth bass, and threadfin shad.
   However, diet-based multiple regression analyses suggested that TotHg
   also increased with benthic foraging for inland silverside and black
   crappie. In both species, benthic prey items were dominated by
   chironomid larvae, explaining the discrepancy with delta C-13. These
   results illustrate the importance of foraging habitat to Hg
   bioaccumulation and indicate that pelagic carbon can strongly subsidize
   the basal energy sources of benthic organisms.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Eagles-Smith, CA (Corresponding Author), US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Davis Field Stn, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.

   isotope approach",INLAND WATERS,2021,11,"4, SI",476-491,OCT 2,"In arid and semiarid regions, extreme temperature events and the
   frequency and duration of drought will increase toward 2050, leading to
   increased salinisation of inland waters, aggravated by catchment erosion
   and human activities (e.g., crop irrigation). With salinisation, a
   decline in biodiversity is expected, with potential negative effects on
   food web structure and ecosystem dynamics. Our objective was to assess
   the changes in community and food web structure in 24 lakes along a wide
   salinity gradient (i.e., subsaline to hypersaline) in a semiarid region
   in northwest China. Fish, zooplankton, and macroinvertebrate communities
   were sampled for taxonomic determination, size structure, and stable
   isotope analysis (SIA; delta C-13 and delta N-15). Based on SIA, we
   calculated the Layman metrics: nitrogen range, carbon range, total area,
   standard ellipses area, and the trophic position, for each community and
   for the entire food web. We found a reduced number of taxa of all
   analysed communities, and the complexity of the entire food web
   decreased in most saline lakes. In addition, the trophic diversity and
   trophic position declined, less so in the larger lakes, but these
   effects were not significant when studying the community food webs
   separately. Our results suggest that increasing salinisation with
   ongoing climate warming will have negative effects on lake ecosystems in
   arid and semiarid regions, emphasising the need to implement management
   measures at the watershed level to prevent or mitigate future changes in
   food web structure and biodiversity due to salinisation.",TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Vidal, N (Corresponding Author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Vejlsovej 25, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark.

   winter wheat fields. Evaluating the flux of the maize-borne carbon into
   the food web after 9 months via stable isotope analysis allowed
   differentiating between prey in predator diets originating from the
   above- and belowground subsystems. Furthermore, we recorded aphid
   populations in predator-reduced and control plots of no-mulch and mulch
   addition treatments. All analyzed soil dwelling species incorporated
   maize-borne carbon. In contrast, only 2 out of 13 aboveground predator
   species incorporated maize carbon, suggesting that these 2 predators
   forage on prey from the above- and belowground systems. Supporting this
   conclusion, densities of these two predator species were increased in
   the mulch addition fields. Nitrogen isotope signatures suggested that
   these generalist predators in part fed on Collembola thereby benefiting
   indirectly from detrital resources. Increased density of these two
   predator species was associated by increased aphid control but the
   identity of predators responsible for aphid control varied in space. One
   of the three wheat fields studied even lacked aphid control despite of
   mulch-mediated increased density of generalist predators. The results
   suggest that detrital subsidies quickly enter belowground food webs but
   only a few aboveground predator species include prey out of the
   decomposer system into their diet. Variation in the identity of predator
   species benefiting from detrital resources between sites suggest that,
   depending on locality, different predator species are subsidised by prey
   out of the decomposer system and that these predators contribute to
   aphid control. Therefore, by engineering the decomposer subsystem via
   detrital subsidies, biological control by generalist predators may be
   strengthened.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Article,English,"Scheu, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Gottingen, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach Inst Zool \& Anthropol, Berliner Str 28, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.

   fluviatilis</i>) introductions to a biodiversity-rich lake using stable
   isotope analysis",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2023,13,1,NA,OCT 17,"Biological invasions, particularly of fish species, significantly
   threaten aquatic ecosystems. Among these invaders, the introduction of
   the European perch (Perca fluviatilis) can have particularly detrimental
   effects on native communities, affecting both ecosystem functioning and
   human well-being. In this study, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope
   analysis was employed, using perch originating from five different
   ecosystems, to model the effects of their hypothetical introduction into
   znik Lake, an economically and ecologically important, biodiversity-rich
   lake in northern Turkey, to ultimately assess their potential predation
   impact and competition with native predators. The results revealed that
   if perch were introduced to the community, they would - considering gape
   size limitations - primarily prey upon Vimba vimba and Rutilus rutilus,
   indicating a significant feeding pressure on these species. Furthermore,
   the study identified a potential overlap and competition for resources
   between commonly mesopredator perch and the European catfish Silurus
   glanis, the current top predator in the ecosystem. Both species would
   occupy top predatory positions, emphasizing the potential disruption of
   predator-prey dynamics. Our findings underscore the potential ecological
   repercussions of perch invasions. The selective predation on V. vimba
   and R. rutilus, with the latter being consumed to a lesser extent by
   perch, could lead to cascading effects throughout the food web, altering
   the community structure, and ecosystem dynamics. Additionally, the
   competition between perch and S. glanis raises concerns about effects on
   the stability and functioning of the fish community. These results
   highlight the need for proactive management strategies to mitigate the
   risk of perch introductions. Strict regulations on the movement and
   introduction of invasive species, along with comprehensive monitoring,
   are crucial for preserving native communities and maintaining the
   ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems. Our study demonstrates
   the potential predation impact of perch on vulnerable fish species and
   the competition with the established apex predator, emphasizing the
   importance of considering the ecological consequences of perch invasions
   and informing management decisions to ensure the conservation and
   sustainability of aquatic ecosystems.",NATURE PORTFOLIO,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Article,English,"Tarkan, AS (Corresponding Author), Mula Stk Kocman Univ, Dept Basic Sci, Fac Fisheries, Mentee, Mula, Turkiye.

   benefited from the development of stable isotope analyses (SIA) as
   dietary tracers. SIA are particularly useful in elucidating the
   structure of deep sea food webs given the constraints involved in
   obtaining gut-content data from deep trawling. We used carbon and

   R (SIBER) and Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR) routines, to determine
   the trophic ecology of five deep-sea fishes from the upper continental
   slope of the Celtic Sea. SIA made it possible to deduce some general
   tendencies in food-web structure and species trophic interactions and
   confirmed diet determined by gut-content analysis for the same species,
   in other ecoregions. More specifically, mixing models revealed that the
   deep sea species considered are omnivorous and are able to feed on all
   the sampled taxa. Based on isotopic ratio, no clear differences in fish
   diet could be detected from one species to another except for rabbit
   fish, which has benthic affinities. Three species, blackbelly rosefish,
   greater forkbeard and softhead grenadier showed overlapping isotopic
   niches. This study is the first attempt to describe the trophic ecology
   of deep sea species on the Celtic Sea upper continental slope. In the
   context of the development of ecosystem integrated modeling approaches

   coyotes (<i>Canis latrans</i>) in southern California",PLOS ONE,2020,15,2,NA,FEB 5,"Urban environments are unique because fragments of natural or
   semi-natural habitat are embedded within a potentially permeable matrix
   of human-dominated areas, creating increased landscape and, potentially,
   habitat heterogeneity. In addition, urban areas can provide diet
   subsidies for wildlife species in the form of fruiting ornamental
   plants, trash, and domestic animals. Ecological opportunity in the forms
   of habitat and food heterogeneity are thought to be important mechanisms
   in maintaining individual specialization. Identifying which contexts,
   traits, and mechanisms determine the success or failure of individuals
   within an urban wildlife population could potentially provide
   predictions about which populations may succeed in human-dominated
   landscapes and which may experience local extinction. We used both scat
   and stable isotope analysis of whiskers to investigate the degree to
   which coyotes (Canis latrans) utilized anthropogenic subsidies and
   exhibited individual diet specialization across the urban-rural gradient
   in southern California. Land use surrounding scat and isotope sample
   locations was also evaluated to determine the effect of land cover on
   diet. Human food constituted a significant portion of urban coyote diet
   (22\% of scats, 38\% of diet estimated by stable isotope analysis).
   Domestic cats (Felis catus) and ornamental fruit and seeds were also
   important items in urban coyote diets. Consumption of anthropogenic
   items decreased with decreasing urbanization. In suburban areas,
   seasonality influenced the frequency of occurrence of anthropogenic
   subsidies with increased consumption in the dry season. The amount of
   altered open space (areas such as golf courses, cemeteries, and
   landscaped parks) nearby had a negative effect on the consumption of
   anthropogenic items in both urban and suburban areas. Contrary to our
   hypothesis, urban coyotes displayed reduced between-individual variation
   compared to suburban and rural coyotes. It is possible that the core
   urban areas of cities are so densely developed and subsidized that
   wildlife inhabiting these areas actually have reduced ecological
   opportunity. Suburban animals had the broadest isotopic niches and
   maintained similar individual specialization to rural coyotes. Wildlife
   in suburban areas still have access to relatively undisturbed natural
   areas while being able to take advantage of anthropogenic subsidies in
   neighboring residential areas. Therefore, areas with intermediate urban
   development may be associated with increased ecological opportunity and
   specialization.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Article,English,"Larson, RN (Corresponding Author), Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.

   Linnaeus, 1758?",REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE,2020,36,NA,NA,APR,"The current scenario of global change and the increase of human
   population in coastal areas is leading to the introduction of numerous
   man-made structures into the coastal environment. Those artificial
   structures provide different services at the expenses of habitat loss
   and a range of widely documented ecological impacts. Limpets are
   keystone species that are worldwide established in these artificial
   habitats. However, little is known about the impact of artificial
   coastal defence structures on the diet of limpets. Therefore, the aim of
   this study was to evaluate if different kinds of artificial structures
   (cubes, rip-raps, seawalls and tetrapods) across a geographical gradient
   (western to eastern Alboran Sea), could affect the food consumption of
   the limpet Patella caerulea by using carbon and nitrogen isotopes
   analysis. Our results suggested that for certain localities, there was a
   shift in the trophic niche of P. caerulea inhabiting artificial
   substrates in comparison with the nearest natural rocky shore. However,
   patterns were not consistent for all localities and different types of
   artificial structures, which reinforces the importance of considering
   local scales for conservation and management purposes. Finally, delta
   N-15 ratio in P. caerulea is a good indicator of eutrophication at
   regional scales, by showing a gradient of enrichment in the limpet
   tissues from oligotrophic to eutrophic waters within the Alboran Sea.

   analysis of delta C-13 and delta N-15 to determine the complex
   relationships between taxonomic diversity and food web structure of fish
   assemblages among sites in the free-flowing and impounded reaches of the

   non-metric multi-dimensional scaling revealed longitudinal differences
   in Bray-Curtis similarity between assemblages from impounded and those
   from free-flowing sites. Finally, using stable isotope analysis, we
   showed that fishes in the free-flowing section derived nutrients
   primarily from benthic sources while fishes in the impounded section had
   a stronger reliance on pelagic nutrients. Our findings reveal that dams

   on modern and archaeological polar bear bone collagen from the Canadian
   Arctic Archipelago to investigate potential changes in polar bear
   foraging ecology over four-millennia. Polar bear 613C values showed a
   significant decline in the modern samples relative to all archaeological
   time-bins, indicating a disruption in the sources of production that
   support the food web, occurring after the Industrial Revolution. The
   trophic structure, indicated through 615N, remained unaltered throughout
   all time periods. The lower 613C observed in the modern samples
   indicates a change in the relative importance of pelagic (supported by
   open-water phytoplankton) over sympagic (supported by sea ice-associated
   algae) primary production. The consistency in polar bear 613C through
   the late Holocene includes climatic shifts such as the Medieval Warm
   Period (MWP, A.D. 950-1250) and the early stages of the Little Ice Age
   (LIA, A.D. 1300-1850). These findings suggest that polar bears inhabit a

   study was to compare the diet of the sea urchin Arbacia dufresnii, among
   different scenarios of invasion of Undaria in two northern Patagonian
   gulfs. To this end, we determined the relative contribution of kelp to
   the diet of the sea urchin by comparing the gut content and stable
   isotopes in different tissues of A. dufresnii from sites where the
   invasion of Undaria was advanced, relatively recent, or not recorded.
   Because A. dufresnii has a plastic feeding habit and Undaria represents
   a high input of algal biomass, our hypothesis was that A. dufresnii
   feeds on Undaria and that the contribution of the invasive kelp to the
   diet of the sea urchin will be greater according to the time elapsed
   since invasion. Our results confirmed that A. dufresnii fed on Undaria
   and assimilated in gonads and muscle. The contribution of Undaria to the
   sea urchin diet was related to the stage of invasion. In the site with
   an advanced stage of invasion, A. dufresnii consumed the kelp both in
   spring and summer, when sporophytes were mature and senescent,
   respectively. However, in the recently invaded site, A. dufresnii
   consumed Undaria only in summer, when the kelp was senescent. Arbacia
   dufresnii is an omnivore species with the plasticity to adapt its diet
   to a variety of resources depending on the availability in the
   environment, prioritizing faunal items. This work reinforces the
   importance of complementing gut analysis with stable isotope analysis to
   determine the contribution of items in the diet. Although the impacts of
   an invasive alga on food webs and ecosystem structure are difficult to
   evaluate, performing these analyses in different scenarios may allow
   better understanding the local food web structure and assessing the
   possible ecological consequences over the invaded habitat.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Epherra, L (Corresponding Author), Ctr Estudio Sistemas Marinos CESIMAR CONICET, Blvd Brown 2915, Puerto Madryn, Argentina.

   Bouvetoya",POLAR RESEARCH,2016,35,NA,NA,NA,"The Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) is a key marine predator
   in the Southern Ocean, a region that has recently started to show
   changes as a result of global climate change. Here, carbon (delta C-13)
   and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope analyses on whole blood and
   plasma samples were used to examine the isotopic niche of lactating
   female Antarctic fur seals. Using recently developed Bayesian approaches
   to determine changes in isotopic niche, a significant increase in delta
   C-13 and delta N-15 was found between 1997 and 2015; this change
   occurred at an average rate of 0.067\%0 (delta C-13) and 0.072\%0 (delta
   N-15) per year over this period. This suggests that a marked isotopic
   niche shift has occurred over this period, which very likely corresponds
   to a shift in diet towards prey at a higher trophic level, such as fish
   (replacing krill). Although our sampling design prevented us from
   exploring a seasonal trend in a conclusive manner, our data suggest that
   concurrent increases in delta C-13 and delta N-15 might occur as the
   breeding season progresses. At a seasonal scale, an average decrease of
   0.7 parts per thousand per month (95\% confidence interval = {[}0.9;
   0.6]) in delta C-13 might have occurred, concurrently with an average
   increase of 1.1\% per month in delta N-15. The results of this study
   constitute the first isotopic assessment for female Antarctic fur seals
   from Bouvetoya and provide a baseline for the use of this predator
   species as a sentinel of the marine trophic system in one of the least

   seasonal environments, such as the Arctic, and is driven by changes in
   resource availability. Variation in resource availability can lead to
   species differences in diet composition, isotopic niche width, and
   trophic position (TP) across seasons. Here, we used tissue samples that
   represent two distinct turnover rates for diet (liver = shorter term,
   muscle = longer term) from 18 fish and three marine mammal species to
   investigate seasonal (i) variation in TPs within the Southampton Island
   marine ecosystem of Hudson Bay, (ii) variation in consumer isotopic
   niche width within this part of the food web, and (iii) variation in
   community niche dynamics among a fish and marine mammal community using
   stable carbon (313C) and nitrogen (315N) isotope analyses. Many
   zooplanktivores and piscivores increased in TP in summer (i.e.,
   shorter-term turnover period), whereas benthic feeders dependent on
   ice-obligate prey decreased in TP. Most isotopic niche widths and
   community metrics (315N range, total ellipse area, mean centroid
   distance) were higher in liver than muscle. Our findings demonstrate

   of the tradition millets agriculture in North China. However, when and
   how wheat came to be a staple crop in China is still unclear. Stable
   isotope data from some archaeological sites suggested that the dietary
   change from C-4 based diet to C-3/C-4 mixed diet occurred during the
   Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770-221 BC) on the Central Plains of China.
   However, the role of each C-3 crop (wheat, rice and soybean) in human
   diet is not well understood in this key period. Some scholars have
   argued that wheat made the biggest contribution to human diet among the
   C-3 crops. To further investigate the dietary role of wheat and
   agricultural economy in the Eastern Zhou on the Central Plains of China,
   combined methods of stable isotope analysis on human bones and starch
   grain analysis on human dental calculus were conducted at Laodaojing
   cemetery during the Warring States period.
   The mean delta C-13 values (-14.7 +/- 2 parts per thousand, n = 24) and
   mean delta N-15 values (9.1 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand, n = 24) of
   individuals from Laodaojing cemetery suggest that Laodaojing humans had
   a reliance on the mixture of C-3/C-4 foods and a certain proportion of
   animal protein was consumed. Given that the small elevation of delta
   N-15 values (<3 parts per thousand) of Laodaojing humans, the
   contribution of domesticated animals to the mixed C-3/C-4 diet of
   Laodaojing population is relatively limited. Combined with starch grains
   extracted from human dental calculus, we argue that C-3 and C-4 foods at
   Laodaojing were mainly derived from wheat and millets respectively.
   Temporal investigations of stable isotope data and archaeobotanical
   evidences from the late Longshan period to Eastern Zhou Dynasty show the
   importance of wheat increased in agricultural economy slowly since its
   introduction into the Central Plains of China. Until the Eastern Zhou
   Dynasty, wheat as a C-3 crop played an important dietary role in human
   diet of the Central Plains. A transformation from millet-based to
   millets/wheat-based agricultural economy occurred along with the shift

   role in the stability of communities. In river systems, fragmentation of
   natural habitats and environmental changes alters the energy basis and
   community composition, consequently leading to variations in the
   community's trophic structure and niche space. However, our
   understanding of how the trophic structure responds to environmental
   changes is still very limited. Here, based on stable isotope data, we
   explored and compared trophic positions (TPs), community-wide trophic
   metrics, and isotope niche space of fish communities in three reaches
   with different hydrogeomorphic conditions along a highly regulated
   subtropical river over three seasons. The community trophic structure
   and niche space showed notable spatiotemporal variations. Overall, the
   downstream reach had lower TPs, trophic diversity but higher trophic
   redundancy. The middle reach occupied a wider isotope niche space than
   other reaches, with the largest niche size during autumn. Furthermore,
   the niche overlap was relatively high in winter between reaches and in
   the downstream between seasons. The results implied a homogenization of
   feeding functional groups and energy flow pathways of species in the
   downstream community associated with the change of energy source and
   stability of hydrological conditions. The relationship between trophic
   structure and environmental factors suggested that the dam-induced
   alteration in hydrological-related aspects may drive the changes in the
   functional group composition, together with changes in energy basis,
   resulting in differences in the trophic structure of the community. The
   results of the present study deepen our understanding of how ecosystem
   functions respond to disturbance, thus contributing to improved ability

   fish?",BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,2010,101,1-3,311-322,DEC,"Climate change is projected to increase mean temperature of northern
   lakes by the end of the twenty-first century. To simulate this scenario,
   during 2004-2007 we imposed artificial mixing in Halsjarvi, a small,
   polyhumic, boreal lake in southern Finland, to increase the depth of the
   thermocline by similar to 1.5 m. The aims of the experiment were to
   evaluate potential effects of climate change on biogeochemical cycles,
   especially of mercury, and on food web structure, productivity and
   biodiversity in dystrophic lake ecosystems. Following the initial
   depression of the thermocline in the experimental lake, the methyl
   mercury (MeHg) concentration in small European perch (Perca fluviatlis
   L.) decreased and remained lower throughout the study. In contrast,
   perch in a nearby reference lake exhibited increased MeHg during the
   same period. The delta(15)N values of the muscle tissue of perch were
   similar in both lakes over the study period, suggesting that the trophic
   position of perch remained unchanged. However, delta(13)C values of
   perch became clearly more negative in Halsjarvi, probably due to the
   greater mixing of the water column that resulted in changes in the
   carbon sources for the food web. A marked decrease of epilimnetic MeHg
   concentrations recorded during the experiment was considered to be the
   main reason for the decreased MeHg concentrations in perch. The results
   suggest that oxygen-related changes induced by climate change will be
   more important than direct temperature changes for MeHg accumulation in
   fish in small humic lakes with persistent oxygen deficiency in the
   hypolimnion.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Article; Proceedings Paper,English,"Rask, M (Corresponding Author), Finnish Game \& Fisheries Res Inst, Evo 16970, Finland.

   marine environment, which may impact higher trophic level predators such
   as the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) and the structure of their
   food webs. We used bulk stable isotope analysis and compound-specific
   isotope analysis (CSIA) of individual amino acids (AA) to examine
   bowhead whale trophic position and the biogeochemistry of one of their
   feeding grounds, Disko Bay, West Greenland, over a period of 7 years
   (2007-2013). We also examined whether environmental conditions such as
   sea ice concentration and sea surface temperature were causing any
   interannual variation in isotope data. Bulk delta N-15 values were
   consistent across the 7 years of sampling and were similar between sex
   classes. Bulk delta C-13 and essential-AAs delta C-13 values displayed
   an overall temporal decline of 1.0 and 1.4\%, respectively. A
   significant positive linear relationship was found between delta C-13 of
   bulk skin and essential-AAs suggesting that some of the observed
   isotopic variation in bowhead whales between years reflect changes in
   the carbon at the base of the food web. There were no correlations
   between the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of isotopic tracers with
   sea ice concentrations or sea surface temperatures. The trophic level of
   bowhead whales remained stable over time despite large interannual
   variability in ice and temperature regimes. Our results indicate that
   the recent environmental changes in West Greenland resulted in no
   trophic perturbation being transferred to bowhead whales during that
   time period. Our study shows that the novel approach of CSIA-AA can be
   used effectively to study the combined temporal variation of bowhead
   whale food web structure and ecosystem isotopic baseline values and
   detect changes at the species and ecosystem levels.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Article,English,"Pomerleau, C (Corresponding Author), Univ Manitoba, Ctr Earth \& Observat Sci, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.

   challenge for understanding the ecology of invasions and prioritising
   conservation and research efforts in marine ecosystems. Marenzelleria
   spp. are amongst the most successful non-native benthic species in the
   Baltic Sea during recent decades. We used stable isotope analysis (SIA)
   to test the hypothesis that the dominance of polychaete worm
   Marenzelleria arctia in the zoobenthos of the Neva Estuary after its
   invasion in the late 2000s is related to the position of this species in
   the benthic food webs. The trend towards a gradual decrease in the
   biomass of Marenzelleria worms was observed during 2014-2020, probably
   due to significant negative relationships between the biomass of
   oligochaetes and polychaetes, both of which, according to SIA, primarily
   use allochthonous organic carbon for their production. The biomass of
   benthic crustaceans practically did not change and remained very low.
   The SIA showed that, in contrast to the native crustacean Monoporeia
   affinis, polychates are practically not consumed either by the main
   invertebrate predator Saduria entomon, which preys on M. affinis,
   oligochaetes and larvae of chironomids or by benthivorous fish that
   prefer native benthic crustaceans. A hypothetical model for the position
   and functional role of M. arctia in the bottom food web is presented and
   discussed. According the model, the invasion of M. arctia has created an
   offshoot food chain in the Estuary food webs. The former dominant food
   webs, associated with native crustaceans, are now poorly developed. The
   lack of top-down control obviously contributes to the significant
   development of the Marenzelleria food chain, which, unlike native food
   chains, does not provide energy transfer from autochthonous and
   allochthonous organic matter to the upper trophic levels. The study
   showed that an alien species, without displacing native species, can
   significantly change the structure of food webs, creating blind
   offshoots of the food chain.",PENSOFT PUBLISHERS,"12 PROF GEORGI ZLATARSKI ST, SOFIA, 1700, BULGARIA",Article,English,"Golubkov, S (Corresponding Author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Univ Skaya Emb 1, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.

   boreal peatland",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2017,62,8,1377-1388,AUG,"Compared to other temporary aquatic ecosystems, we know relatively
   little about how inundation frequency and duration (i.e. hydrologic
   regime) influences the structure of aquatic communities in northern
   peatlands. In this study, we examined patterns in nutrient availability
   and aquatic community structure during a natural flooding event in an
   Alaskan fen where water-table position had been manipulated in three
   large-scale experimental plots during previous years to simulate both
   drought (lowered water-table treatment) and flooding (raised water-table
   treatment) conditions relative to a control without manipulation.
   Although the natural flood disrupted the long-term experimental
   manipulation, it provided an opportunity to evaluate how variation in
   past hydrologic regime influences nutrient dynamics and aquatic food web
   structure during periods of inundation in a northern boreal peatland.
   Despite similar water depth among experimental plots during the time of
   sampling (i.e. water was above the peat surface in all plots),
   water-column nutrient concentrations were significantly greater in the
   drought treatment (where water table had been lowered during the
   previous growing season) compared to the raised water-table treatment
   and the control. Algal production increased with enhanced nutrient
   availability across all water-table treatments and was most elevated
   following the rewetting of dry sediments in the drought treatment.
   Consumer biomass (heterotrophic bacteria and macroinvertebrates)
   increased with algal production and was significantly greater in the
   drought treatment compared to the raised water-table treatment and the
   control. Consumer biomass decreased into the second year of constant
   inundation as algal production was constrained by reduced nutrient
   availability. Stable isotope analysis (C-13 and N-15) showed that
   elevated levels of periphyton (i.e. the intact biofilm) associated with
   enhanced nutrient availability promoted energy transfer to higher
   trophic levels (grazers and predators) rather than living or dead mosses
   or vascular plant material. Consumption of algal material by grazers
   altered the size and composition of the algal community. The algal
   community shifted from coccoid (edible) to filamentous (inedible) growth
   forms with increased grazer abundance in the drought treatment, possibly
   owing to selective grazing. Conversely, there was a similar proportion
   of edible and inedible taxa in the control and raised treatments where
   grazers were lower in abundance. Our results show that the legacy
   effects of drought can regulate aquatic community structure in northern
   peatlands. Within a predictive context, our findings suggest that
   conditions of more variable hydrology expected with climate change (i.e.
   increased frequency of drought) occurring across northern latitudes will
   promote energy flow to higher trophic levels by releasing nutrient
   constraints on microalgae during periods of inundation.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Wyatt, KH (Corresponding Author), Ball State Univ, Dept Biol, Muncie, IN 47306 USA.

   size-structured, with top predators coupling across different energy
   sources. However, evidence supporting this hypothesis is still scarce,
   especially in highly diverse tropical rivers. In the present study, we
   explored the association between body size, trophic position, and the
   use of allochthonous and autochthonous basal production sources in the
   Volta Grande rapids of the Xingu River, a major clearwater tributary of
   the Amazon River, during the period prior to operation of the Belo Monte
   Hydropower Plant (BMHP). This section of the river contains a maze of
   channels with rocky shoals that support dozens of endemic fishes,
   mollusks and other aquatic taxa that may be impacted by flow regulation
   by the Pimental Dam located upstream. During the low-water season, we
   surveyed fish, crustaceans, mollusks, sponges, aquatic and terrestrial
   insects, zooplankton, and basal production sources to obtain tissue
   samples for analysis of stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta C-13) and
   nitrogen (delta N-15). The results indicated that the biomass of most
   aquatic organisms appears to be largely supported by riparian
   vegetation, highlighting the importance of the lateral connectivity
   between aquatic and terrestrial habitats. In contrast to expectation, we
   did not observe a gradual increase in the coupling of energy pathways
   with increasing body size and trophic position. These findings provide a
   baseline for the trophic ecology of this river under the natural flow
   regime that can be used for future impact assessments, and they also
   indicate that more complex food web models, potentially including
   additional functional traits (e.g., gut length) are needed to describe

   Tanganyika assessed using stable isotope analysis",JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH,2019,45,6,1205-1214,DEC,"The pelagic fishery of Lake Tanganyika, which is largely made up of the
   three species Lates stappersii, Limnothrissa miodon, and Stolothrissa
   tanganicae, has been in decline, and there is no clear understanding of
   the primary underlying causes. It has been suggested that climate change
   has altered the primary productivity of the system, but detailed
   knowledge of the system's food web is required to elucidate the effect
   on higher trophic levels. The aim of this study is to determine the diet
   of the three commercially important fish species. Muscle tissue samples
   for stable isotope analysis were taken from February through April 2017,
   supplemented with stomach samples from L stappersii for use in stomach
   content analysis. The stomach analysis showed an ontogenetic change in
   the diet composition of L stappersii, shifting from copepods to fish
   larvae, supplemented with shrimp, to whole fish prey as the fish grew
   larger. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values from fish muscle were
   consistent with this observation, and also seemed to indicate that fish
   of similar sizes had similar diets, irrespective of species. This
   suggests that the diet of the pelagic fish species might be better
   explained by size, rather than species. The isotope data revealed a
   short range of delta N-15 values from primary consumers to fish, which
   may help explain the high fisheries productivity of Lake Tanganyika, and
   the strong impact of primary productivity changes on fisheries yield.

   signatures of the bottom-dwelling caridean shrimp Nauticaris marionis
   were measured during April and May between 1984 and 2000 in the vicinity
   of Marion Island (the Prince Edward Islands, Southern Ocean). There was
   one trophic-level enrichment in bulk delta(15)N and delta(13)C

   N. marionis, suggesting distinct trophic differentiation among major
   shrimp size groups. Both delta(15)N and delta(13)C values of N. marionis

   However, compound-specific delta(15)N measurements of amino acids
   indicated that N. marionis from the inter-island realm occupied the
   trophic level of second order carnivores, while similarly sized shrimps
   in the near-shore realm were at the trophic level of first order
   carnivores. Compound-specific measurements also identified a change in

   Valley, Syria",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2018,166,4,861-874,AUG,"ObjectivesStable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (C-13 and N-15) were
   used to reconstruct the history of subsistence strategies in the middle
   Euphrates valley, NE Syria, in six temporal subsets dating from the
   Early Bronze Age (c. 2300 BCE) to the Modern period (19th/20th century
   CE). The study aims to demonstrate that changes in political and social
   organization over time, for which the archaeological record suggests
   different goals of land use and modes of production, register through
   dietary patterns that are reflected in isotopic data.
   Materials and methods173 dentin samples were taken from human
   individuals buried at three sites (Tell Ashara, Tell Masaikh and Gebel
   Mashtale) together with 15 animal bone samples. Distribution of the C-13
   and N-15 values in collagen was interpreted in diachronic perspective,
   and with regard to lifetime shifts between childhood and adolescence.
   ResultsDiachronically, isotope signatures indicate a clear decrease in
   N-15 values accompanied by a small shift in C-13 values between the Old
   Babylonian (c. 1800-1600 BCE) and the Neo-Assyrian (c. 850-600 BCE)
   subsets. A major shift in C-13 values occurred between the Early Islamic
   (c. 600-1200 CE) and Modern (c. 1800-1950) periods. Ontogenetic changes
   only occur in a few individuals, but these suggest change of residence
   between childhood and adolescence.
   DiscussionThe depletion in N-15 from the Neo-Assyrian period onwards is
   best explained in terms of a shift from intensive to extensive farming,
   triggered by the fall of regional city-states after the Old Babylonian
   period and the formation of large supra-regional polities in the
   Neo-Assyrian period and later. The enrichment in C-13 during the Modern

   stream food webs",ECOLOGY,2024,105,1,NA,JAN,"Food webs are complex ecological networks that reveal species
   interactions and energy flow in ecosystems. Prevailing ecological
   knowledge on forested streams suggests that their food webs are based on
   allochthonous carbon, driven by a constant supply of organic matter from
   adjacent vegetation and limited primary production due to low light
   conditions. Extreme climatic disturbances can disrupt these natural
   ecosystem dynamics by altering resource availability, which leads to
   changes in food web structure and functioning. Here, we quantify the
   response of stream food webs to two major hurricanes (Irma and Maria,
   Category 5 and 4, respectively) that struck Puerto Rico in September
   2017. Within two tropical forested streams (first and second order), we
   collected ecosystem and food web data 6 months prior to the hurricanes
   and 2, 9, and 18 months afterward. We assessed the structural (e.g.,
   canopy) and hydrological (e.g., discharge) characteristics of the
   ecosystem and monitored changes in basal resources (i.e., algae,
   biofilm, and leaf litter), consumers (e.g., aquatic invertebrates,
   riparian consumers), and applied Layman's community-wide metrics using
   the isotopic composition of C-13 and N-15. Continuous stream discharge
   measurements indicated that the hurricanes did not cause an extreme
   hydrological event. However, the sixfold increase in canopy openness and
   associated changes in litter input appeared to trigger an increase in
   primary production. These food webs were primarily based on
   terrestrially derived carbon before the hurricanes, but most taxa
   (including Atya and Xiphocaris shrimp, the consumers with highest
   biomass) shifted their food source to autochthonous carbon within 2
   months of the hurricanes. We also found evidence that the hurricanes
   dramatically altered the structure of the food web, resulting in shorter
   (i.e., smaller food-chain length), narrower (i.e., lower diversity of
   carbon sources) food webs, as well as increased trophic species packing.
   This study demonstrates how hurricane disturbance can alter stream food
   webs, changing the trophic base from allochthonous to autochthonous
   resources via changes in the physical environment (i.e., canopy
   defoliation). As hurricanes become more frequent and severe due to
   climate change, our findings greatly contribute to our understanding of
   the mechanisms that maintain forested stream trophic interactions amidst
   global change.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Gutiérrez-Fonseca, PE (Corresponding Author), Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm \& Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.

   locations), and those where F. serratus is still dominant (central
   locations). Comparisons were made among locations situated at the same
   latitude and sharing a recent history of F. serratus dominance. Trophic
   relationships were analyzed using natural abundances of carbon and
   nitrogen stable isotopes. We report clear changes in the structure of
   benthic assemblages and lower trophic positioning of some consumers,
   suggesting an overall shrinkage of the food web length at the
   contracting range edge of F. serratus, which will transfer to higher
   trophic levels. Under present and future climatic scenarios, shifts in
   the distribution of coastal ecosystem engineers could entail a

   community with seasonal shifts in food sources",MARINE BIOLOGY,2018,165,1,NA,JAN,"Stable isotopes are widely used to better understand dietary
   contributions and trophic interactions in benthic ecosystems. However,
   the traditional delta C-13-delta N-15 bi-plots can only depict food-web
   structure for a single time period or space location. Various
   statistical approaches have now been developed to identify food-web
   changes in temporal or spatial scale. In the present study, three
   community-level statistical methods, including circular statistics,
   Layman et al.' s metrics and Bayesian Ellipses, were applied to compare
   natural abundance stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data from primary
   producers, meiofauna (nematodes and copepods), and macrofauna
   (polychaetes) in an intertidal area between summer and winter. Bayesian
   mixing model was also used to determine the food source contributions of
   consumers. In summer, data suggested that benthic microalgae were a
   dominant food source for most consumers, except for nematode
   Spilophorella sp. which mainly relied on seagrass detritus. While in
   winter, there was a significant increase in reliance on seagrass-based
   carbon for the consumers. The trophic positions of polychaete Eunice sp.
   and nematode Ditlevsenella sp. also differed between summer and winter,
   suggesting that they could change their feeding habits and behaviour
   according to time and availability of food. Using community-based
   statistics to quantitatively analyze stable isotope data can thus
   elucidate changes in food-web structure. In addition, considerable
   variations in food source utilization and trophic level for the same
   genus or species may imply that the feeding ecology of benthic infauna
   should be interpreted with caution and cannot be relied on buccal
   morphology alone.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",Article,English,"Shin, PKS (Corresponding Author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Biol \& Chem, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

   non-native bloody red shrimp (<i>Hemimysis anomala</i>) increase
   biomagnification risk in nearshore food webs",JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH,2022,48,1,252-259,FEB,"The establishment of non-native species can result in complex shifts in
   food-web structure and ecosystem function that alter the
   bioaccumulation, transfer, and biomagnification of contaminants.
   Hemimysis anomala (the bloody red shrimp), a mysid native to the
   Ponto-Caspian region that is now established throughout the Laurentian
   Great Lakes region (North America) and Europe, is characterized by high
   densities and a trophic ecology that may be consequential to mercury
   fluxes and bioaccumulation. We combined methylmercury (MeHg) and stable
   isotope (delta N-15 and delta C-13) analyses of invertebrates from
   Seneca Lake (NY, USA) to test the hypotheses that mercury concentrations
   differ among (1) H. anomala and native or naturalized analogs due to
   food-web position and (2) stages of H. anomala due to ontogenetic diet
   shifts. The MeHg concentration and delta N-15 of H. anomala exceeded
   other littoral invertebrates (such as amphipods, dreissenid mussels, and
   zooplankton >153 mu m) and were as high as the pelagic, native Mysis
   diluviana. These taxa-specific patterns indicate intensified
   biomagnification of MeHg is possible in near-shore and reef-spawning
   fish following the establishment of H. anomala, an energy-dense prey
   item for economically and ecologically important fish. Larger, adult H.
   anomala had higher MeHg concentrations and more enriched delta N-15 than
   juveniles, and H. anomala collected at a littoral site had higher MeHg
   than a canal site. These intraspecies contrasts are consistent with the
   shift toward zooplanktivory in adult H. anomala. As both putative prey
   for fish and competitors for shared zooplankton resources, H. anomala
   may impact fish in compounding ways. (C) 2021 International Association

   trophic pathways from soil microorganisms to microbial consumers to
   predators in conventional versus organic farming systems planted for the
   first time with maize. Organic farming led to an increase in microbial
   biomass in particular that of fungi as indicated by phospholipid fatty
   acids (PLFAs). Microbial PLFAs reflected the conversion from C(3) to
   C(4) plants by a shift in delta 13C of 2 parts per thousand, whereas the
   isotopic signal in fatty acids (FAs) of Collembola was much more
   pronounced. In the euedaphic Protaphorura fimata the delta 13C values in
   maize fields exceeded that in C(3) (soybean) fields by up to 10 parts
   per thousand, indicating a close relationship between diet and
   vegetation cover. In the epedaphic Orchesella villosa delta 13C values
   shifted by 4 parts per thousand, suggesting a wider food spectrum
   including carbon of former C(3) crop residues. Differences in delta 13C
   of corresponding FAs in consumers and resources were assessed to assign
   food web links. P. fimata was suggested as root and fungal feeder in
   soybean fields, fungal feeder in conventional and leaf consumer in
   organically managed maize fields. O. villosa likely fed on root and
   bacteria under soybean, and bacteria and fungi under maize. Comparison
   of delta 13C values in FAs of the cursorial spider Pardosa agrestis and
   O. villosa implied the latter as important prey species in soybean
   fields. In contrast, the web-building spider Mangora acalypha showed no
   predator-prey relationship with Collembola. The determination of delta
   13C values in trophic biomarker FAs allowed detailed insight into the
   structure of the decomposer food web and identified diet-shifts in both
   consumers at the base of the food web and in top predators in organic
   versus conventional agricultural systems. The results indicate changes
   in major trophic links and therefore carbon flux through the food web by
   conversion of conventional into organic farming systems.","WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC","COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",Article,English,"Haubert, D (Corresponding Author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Zool, Schnittspahnstr 3, DE-64287 Darmstadt, Germany.

   from primary producers. In the Arctic, declines in sea ice due to
   warming climate could lead to changes in this food supply with as yet
   unknown effects on benthic trophic dynamics. Benthic consumer diets and
   food web structure were studied in a seasonally ice-covered region of
   Baffin Bay during spring 2016 at stations ranging in depth from 199 to
   2,111 m. We used a novel combination of highly branched isoprenoid (HBI)
   lipid biomarkers and stable isotope ratios (delta C-13, delta N-15) to
   better understand the relationship between the availability of carbon
   sources in spring on the seafloor and their assimilation and transfer
   within the benthic food web. Organic carbon from sea ice (sympagic
   carbon {[}SC]) was an important food source for benthic consumers. The
   lipid biomarker analyses revealed a high relative contribution of SC in
   sediments (mean SC\% + standard deviation {[} SD] = 86\%+ 16.0, n = 17)
   and in benthic consumer tissues (mean SC\%+ SD = 78\%+ 19.7, n = 159).
   We also detected an effect of sea-ice concentration on the relative
   contribution of SC in sediment and in benthic consumers. Cluster
   analysis separated the study region into three different zones according
   to the relative proportions of SC assimilated by benthic macrofauna. We
   observed variation of the benthic food web between zones, with increases
   in the width of the ecological niche in zones with less sea-ice
   concentration, indicating greater diversity of carbon sources
   assimilated by consumers. In zones with greater sea-ice concentration,
   the higher availability of SC increased the ecological role that primary
   consumers play in driving a stronger transfer of nutrients to higher
   trophic levels. Based on our results, SC is an important energy source
   for Arctic deep-sea benthos in Baffin Bay, such that changes in spring

   suggests a sea ice-driven pelagic ecosystem during winter",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,2018,24,10,4667-4681,OCT,"How the abundant pelagic life of the Southern Ocean survives winter
   darkness, when the sea is covered by pack ice and phytoplankton
   production is nearly zero, is poorly understood. Ice-associated
   (sympagic) microalgae could serve as a high-quality carbon source during
   winter, but their significance in the food web is so far unquantified.
   To better understand the importance of ice algae-produced carbon for the
   overwintering of Antarctic organisms, we investigated fatty acid (FA)
   and stable isotope compositions of 10 zooplankton species, and their
   potential sympagic and pelagic carbon sources. FA-specific carbon stable
   isotope compositions were used in stable isotope mixing models to
   quantify the contribution of ice algae-produced carbon ((Ice)) to the
   body carbon of each species. Mean (Ice) estimates ranged from 4\% to
   67\%, with large variations between species and depending on the FA used
   for the modelling. Integrating the (Ice) estimates from all models, the
   sympagic amphipod Eusirus laticarpus was the most dependent on ice algal
   carbon ((Ice): 54\%-67\%), and the salp Salpa thompsoni showed the least
   dependency on ice algal carbon ((Ice): 8\%-40\%). Differences in (Ice)
   estimates between FAs associated with short-term vs. long-term lipid
   pools suggested an increasing importance of ice algal carbon for many
   species as the winter season progressed. In the abundant winter-active
   copepod Calanus propinquus, mean (Ice) reached more than 50\% in late
   winter. The trophic carbon flux from ice algae into this copepod was
   between 3 and 5mgCm(-2)day(-1). This indicates that copepods and other
   ice-dependent zooplankton species transfer significant amounts of carbon
   from ice algae into the pelagic system, where it fuels the food web, the
   biological carbon pump and elemental cycling. Understanding the role of
   ice algae-produced carbon in these processes will be the key to

   strongly influenced by anthropogenic inputs of nutrients as well as
   contaminants. This study characterizes food web structure, mercury
   concentrations, and biomagnification of mercury in two embayments in
   northern Lake Victoria that differ in their connectivity to the open
   lake, trophic status, and the influence of local anthropogenic
   pollution. Murchison Bay is a semi-confined hypereutrophic bay in a
   densely populated region, while Napoleon Gulf is mesotrophic and is well
   flushed with water from the open lake. Based on stable carbon and
   nitrogen isotope analysis, food web structure was similar at both sites,
   with short food chains and conspecific fish occupying similar trophic
   positions. However, there were strong differences in net phytoplankton
   delta N-15 and delta C-13 between sites: net phytoplankton delta C-13
   was largely related to trophic status, while delta N-15 values appeared
   to be influenced by inputs of human waste and the prevalence of
   biological nitrogen fixation. Total mercury (THg) concentrations in fish
   were consistently below 200 ng/g wet weight, and despite elevated THg
   concentrations in water in Murchison Bay, THg concentrations in net
   phytoplankton and fish from both embayments did not differ, highlighting
   that THg in water is not always a good predictor of concentrations in
   fish. We also observed that biomagnification of mercury was occurring at
   a lower rate in Murchison Bay than in Napoleon Gulf, and we propose that
   the hypereutrophic state of Murchison Bay may be acting to reduce

   large lake system",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2012,57,11,2342-2355,NOV,"1. Declining abundances of forage fish and the introduction and
   establishment of non-indigenous species have the potential to
   substantially alter resource and habitat exploitation by top predators
   in large lakes. 2. We measured stable isotopes of carbon (d13C) and
   nitrogen (d15N) in field-collected and archived samples of Lake Ontario
   lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and five species of prey fish and
   compared current trophic relationships of this top predator with
   historical samples. 3. Relationships between d15N and lake trout age
   were temporally consistent throughout Lake Ontario and confirmed the
   role of lake trout as a top predator in this food web. However, d13C
   values for age classes of lake trout collected in 2008 ranged from 1.0
   to 3.9 parts per thousand higher than those reported for the population
   sampled in 1992. 4. Isotope mixing models predicted that these changes
   in resource assimilation were owing to the replacement of rainbow smelt
   (Osmerus mordax) by round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in lake trout
   diet and increased reliance on carbon resources derived from nearshore
   production. This contrasts with the historical situation in Lake Ontario
   where d13C values of the lake trout population were dominated by a
   reliance on offshore carbon production. 5. These results indicate a
   reduced capacity of the Lake Ontario offshore food web to support the
   energetic requirements of lake trout and that this top predator has
   become increasingly reliant on prey resources that are derived from
   nearshore carbon pathways.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Rush, SA (Corresponding Author), Mississippi State Univ, Dept Wildlife Fisheries \& Aquaculture, Box 9690, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.

   These are gradually colonised and become more productive as vegetation
   develops in their catchments, creating more complex food webs. Near the
   Jakobshavn Isbr AE in West Greenland, we studied trophic structure and
   food web complexity using stable isotopes in 26 lakes belonging to two
   different age groups (19 new lakes and 7 nearby older (> 150 years)
   ones). The older lakes had significantly higher total nitrogen and
   pelagic chlorophyll-a concentrations, as well as a higher organic matter
   content in the surface sediment. The biomass and richness of
   cladocerans, copepods and rotifers were higher in the older lakes and so
   was the zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio. Multivariate analyses
   showed a marked difference between the zooplankton communities of new
   and older lakes. Layman food web metrics indicated higher food chain
   length and width of invertebrates (zooplankton and benthic
   macroinvertebrates) in the older lakes, being significantly higher in
   lakes with fish. Our findings highlight a potential sequence of
   succession occurring in lakes created by glacial retreat in the Arctic,
   implying an increase in food web complexity and higher taxonomic (and
   likely also functional) diversity following ageing and increased

   trophic transfer efficiencies and predator-prey body mass ratios in food
   webs",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,2002,240,NA,11-20,NA,"Methods of assessing the structure and function of food webs are needed
   to provide a basis for assessing large-scale direct (e.g. fisheries) and
   indirect (e.g. climate change) effects of human activities on marine
   ecosystems. We present a simple synthesis of the complex structure and
   function of a real marine food web, based on analyses of body size
   distributions, production-body size relationships and trophic level-body
   size relationships. We show how size-based estimates of production,
   species richness and trophic level (from nitrogen stable isotope
   analysis) can be used to quantify trophic transfer efficiency, mean
   predator-prey body-mass ratios and the mean ratio of the number of
   predator to prey species in marine food webs. We applied these methods
   to the central North Sea, and estimated transfer efficiencies of 3.7 to
   12.4\%, a mean predator-prey body-mass ratio of 109:1 and a mean ratio
   of the number of predator to prey species of 0.34. We conducted
   sensitivity analyses to show how differences in the fractionation of
   delta(15)N and changes in the slope of the relationship between
   production and delta(15)N affected our predictions. Our estimates of
   transfer efficiency and mean predator-prey body-mass ratios are similar
   to those obtained by costly and labour-intensive diet- and

   riparian ecosystem",OIKOS,2018,127,7,960-969,JUL,"Aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are linked by fluxes of carbon and
   nutrients in riparian areas. Processes that alter these fluxes may
   therefore change the diet and composition of consumer communities. We
   used stable carbon isotope (C-13) analyses to test whether the increased
   abundance of aquatic prey observed in a previous study led to a dietary
   shift in riparian consumers in areas illuminated by artificial light at
   night (ALAN). We measured the contribution of aquatic-derived carbon to
   diets in riparian arthropods in experimentally lit and unlit sites along
   an agricultural drainage ditch in northern Germany. The C-13 signature
   of the spider Pachygnatha clercki (Tetragnathidae) was 0.7 parts per
   thousand lower in the ALAN-illuminated site in summer, indicating a
   greater assimilation of aquatic prey. Bayesian mixing models also
   supported higher intake of aquatic prey under ALAN in spring (34\%
   versus 21\%). In contrast, isotopic signatures for P. clercki (0.3 parts
   per thousand) and Pardosa prativaga (0.7 parts per thousand) indicated a
   preference for terrestrial prey in the illuminated site in spring.
   Terrestrial prey intake increased in spring for P. clercki under ALAN
   (from 70\% to 74\%) and in spring and autumn for P. prativaga (from 68\%
   to 77\% and from 67\% to 72\%) and Opiliones (from 68\% to 72\%; 68\% to
   75\%). This was despite most of the available prey (up to 80\%) being
   aquatic in origin. We conclude that ALAN changed the diet of riparian
   secondary consumers by increasing the density of both aquatic and
   terrestrial prey. Dietary changes were species- and season-specific,
   indicating that the effects of ALAN may interact with phenology and
   feeding strategy. Because streetlights can occur in high density near
   freshwaters, ALAN may have widespread effects on aquatic-terrestrial
   ecosystem linkages.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Manfrin, A (Corresponding Author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol \& Inland Fisheries I, Berlin, Germany.

   properties: A functional perspective for sentinel lakes",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2023,111,1,45-61,JAN,"Climate change is altering both dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   properties and phytoplankton dynamics in lakes. High-altitude lakes are
   good sentinels of global change. However, their value as sentinels
   depends on how well we understand their functioning. This study analysed
   physical, chemical and biological data during three pre-defined periods
   running from complete ice-cover right to the end of the ice-free season,
   in a high-altitude oligotrophic lake. A functional approach was used to
   assess how relationships between DOM and the planktonic community vary
   over time. Phytoplankton functional change was found to occur with
   shifts in DOM. During the ice-influenced period, from February to the
   end of the thaw, the phytoplankton community was dominated by small
   autotrophs and mixotrophic flagellates and DOM from sediment and
   terrestrial origin dominated the DOM pool of the lake. Phytoplankton
   diversity and richness increased during the post-snowmelt overturn
   period, when terrestrial DOM dominated the DOM pool. Finally, large
   siliceous autotrophs, competitive under low nitrogen concentrations and
   high temperature, dominated almost exclusively during the late summer
   period (LSP). Increased phytoplankton biomass meant that
   phytoplankton-derived DOM was dominant during the LSP. These
   phenological changes in the phytoplankton community resulted in
   functional shifts at the base of the food web. Based on the
   relationships between the variables in the study, it can be deduced that
   the nature of the relationship between phytoplankton and bacteria
   progressively shifted from strong top-down control exerted by
   phytoplankton over bacteria towards predominantly bottom-up control at
   the end of the ice-free season. Synthesis. Using a field survey starting
   from complete ice-cover and lasting right to the end of the ice-free
   season in a sentinel lake, we show seasonal shifts in the link between
   DOM properties and plankton community traits. Differences in
   environmental conditions and DOM origin explained variation in
   phytoplankton community structure and function, pointing to seasonal
   shifts in microbial food web interactions. Our research suggests that,
   under climate change, the balance between mixotrophy and autotrophy and
   the control exerted by phytoplankton over bacterioplankton will change
   in oligotrophic high-altitude lakes with large, vegetated catchments.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Dory, F (Corresponding Author), Aix Marseille Univ, Avignon Univ, IMBE, CNRS,IRD, Marseille, France.

   suggests that while phytoplankton likely remains an important life-long

   higher trophic food sources as body size increases. The broader dietary

   contrasting high-latitude environments",DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY,2022,198,NA,NA,APR,"Coastal ecosystems in high latitudes are increasingly impacted by
   glacial melt and river discharge due to climate change. One way to
   understand ecosystem responses to these stressors is assessing trophic
   relationships. The goal of this study was to better understand how
   hydrography influences trophic structure in high-latitude rocky
   intertidal systems. Our working hypothesis was that food web structure
   differs based on hydrographic conditions. We compared the trophic
   structure of key taxa in two rocky intertidal assemblages in the
   northwestern Gulf of Alaska with a similar regional species pool, but
   differing hydrological inputs: one glacially influenced and one
   primarily marine influenced. Common macroalgal and invertebrate taxa, as
   well as particulate organic matter (POM) were sampled at three rocky
   intertidal sites in each region in 2017 and 2018. Food web structure was
   compared using trophic metrics based on the distribution of shared taxa
   in isotopically-derived (813C and 815N) trophic niche space. The trophic
   niche space of the select taxa in the glacially-influenced rocky
   intertidal system was larger, driven by larger ranges in both carbon and
   nitrogen stable isotope values. Lower 813C and 815N values in POM in
   this system suggest that diverse glacially-influenced allochthonous
   organic material was incorporated into the food web. Macroalgae were a
   more important food source than POM in both regions, and even more so in
   the glacially-influenced region, where macroalgae may be an
   energetically preferable food source compared to silt-laden glacial
   inputs. This study suggests that common intertidal taxa have high
   trophic flexibility enabling them to respond to variable food sources
   under differing environmental conditions, especially by broadening
   resource use in more stressful (glacial) conditions. This supported
   another of our hypotheses, i.e. that taxa in food webs occupying a
   larger trophic niche space engaged in more heterogeneous trophic
   pathways and used more diverse resources, which tends to make such
   systems more stable to perturbations that could affect a single
   resource. The common taxa of high-latitude rocky intertidal systems
   studied here seem to be able to respond to the current stress levels of
   glacial input by using more diverse resources. However, it remains to be
   seen how well these systems are suited to maintain trophic stability
   with an expected increase in glacial stress from climate warming.",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Siegert, D (Corresponding Author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries \& Ocean Sci, 2150 North Koyukuk Dr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.

   exposure to Type E Botulism",JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH,2014,40,1,64-70,MAR,"Dreissenid mussels have become important components of the Great Lakes
   biological community since their introduction in the 1980s, but much
   remains to be understood regarding their effect on energy and nutrient
   flows in pelagic systems. Here, we report a new method that tracks
   incorporation of resources of molluskan origin into food webs used by
   aquatic birds. Biochemical tracers (fatty acids and stable carbon
   isotopes) are used to characterize species associated with pelagic and
   benthic food webs in Lake Ontario. Our focus is on the
   polymethylene-interrupted fatty acids (PMI-FAs) because previous
   research identified mollusks as their primary source. We found that
   PMI-FA mass fractions were greater in organisms associated with benthic
   (e.g. round goby) versus pelagic (e.g. alewife) food webs.
   Double-crested cormorants that had recently consumed benthic prey fish,
   i.e. goby, had greater proportions of PMI-FAs in their blood plasma than
   birds which showed no signs of recent goby ingestion. We did not detect
   an increase in mass fractions of PMI-FAs in cryogenically archived
   cormorant eggs following expansion of dreissenid mussels in Lake
   Ontario. However, following the introduction and expansion of round goby
   in the lake, PMI-FAs were detected at greater levels in cormorant eggs.
   These results illustrate how only after dreissenid mussel-facilitated
   establishment of round goby was the full extent of exotic species
   disruption of food webs manifested in fish-eating birds. These food web
   changes may be contributing to negative impacts on aquatic birds
   exemplified by the emergence of Botulism Type E as a significant
   mortality factor in this ecosystem. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published

   releases of freshwater into the Breton Sound estuary, Louisiana (USA)",ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,2005,65,1-2,319-336,OCT,"We examined the effect of freshwater inflows on the aquatic environment
   and macrofauna in the intermediate and brackish zones of the Breton
   Sound estuary. Following water releases from the Caernarvon Freshwater
   Diversion Structure in winter 2000 and spring 2001, we compared
   environmental conditions and the abundance and distribution of nekton in
   May 2001 between the inflow area, which receives freshwater directly
   from the structure, and a nearby reference area. We used these data and
   stable isotope analyses for C, N, and S in brown shrimp Farfantepenaeus
   aztecus and two species of grass shrimp (Palaemonetes paludosus and
   Palaemonetes intermedius) to test four null hypotheses: (1) water
   quality and SAV (submerged aquatic vegetation) coverage were similar
   between the inflow and reference areas, (2) macrofaunal abundance and
   biomass were similar between the two areas, (3) stable isotopic values
   of brown shrimp and grass shrimp were similar between areas, habitat
   types, and species, and (4) brown shrimp distributions were unaffected
   by river inputs. Freshwater from the structure clearly influenced the
   estuarine environment within the inflow area. Releases from the
   Caernarvon structure freshened the inflow area as intended and increased
   SAV and daytime dissolved oxygen concentrations. The response by
   macrofauna to these increased freshwater flows and habitat changes
   involved mostly changes in density and biomass rather than shifts in
   species composition. Although we detected no strong effect of the
   freshwater diversion on brown shrimp abundance or size in the inflow
   area, results of the sulfur stable isotope analysis indicated that brown
   shrimp collected in the inflow area had been growing in higher salinity
   waters, possibly following downstream displacement by the diversion.
   Species that would benefit most from continued freshwater diversions are
   likely to be those species that both use SAV as nursery habitat and
   thrive in a low-salinity environment. Nutrients carried by water from
   the structure were incorporated into the estuarine food web, and these
   nutrient inputs, together with an increase in SAV habitat, may enhance
   overall secondary productivity in the inflow area. (c) 2005 Elsevier

   N-15 of the organic matter sources of epilithic microalgae, macroalgae
   and suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) were readily
   distinguishable to discern their relative contribution to the limpet
   diets, with the most depleted values being found in SPOM and the most
   enriched in macroalgae. The limpets exhibited a spatial trend in
   distribution due to their seasonal migration, with smaller individuals
   in the subtidal zone compared with larger ones on the intertidal sites.
   The limpet isotopes had relatively broad ranges of delta C-13 and delta
   N-15 (-26.6 to -12.8 parts per thousand and 2.6-7.1 parts per thousand,
   respectively), suggesting a dietary shift between habitats as well as
   size classes. The stable isotope ratios for each habitat seem likely to
   reflect the differing availabilities of the three potential food
   sources. Isotope mixing model results indicate a spatial shift in
   dietary mixture between habitats as well as limpet size classes.
   Epilithic microalgae and phytoplankton made great contributions to the
   diet of the subtidal limpets. Together with epilithic microalgae,
   macroalgae were significant contributors to the intertidal limpets where
   macroalgae were abundant. A higher contribution of macroalgae to the
   limpet diets was found in the tide pools. In contrast, while
   phytoplankton was an important food source for the limpet spat, a great
   dietary dependence on epilithic microalgae was found in the small-size
   limpets from the lower intertidal zone. Our results suggest that limpet
   grazing can determine microalgal and/or macroalgal abundance and
   coverage on the Antarctic rocky-shore ecosystem, and trophic structure
   of benthic food web can change along environmental gradients even at
   spatial scales of tens or hundreds of metres in the Antarctic. Crown

   Trophic position and isotopic niche overlap with native species",ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH,2023,32,4,926-937,OCT,"Non-native fish species may generate major ecological impacts on native
   assemblages. This study aims to assess the potential impact of the
   introduced Arapaima gigas on native fish assemblages in two oxbow lakes
   of the Bolivian Amazon. Stable isotope data were used to determine
   trophic position (TP) and isotopic niche overlap, to evaluate potential
   predation and competition interactions, respectively. Results suggest
   that A. gigas is more an omnivore than a top predator, as often claimed.
   Arapaima gigas occupied an intermediate TP between detritivore/herbivore
   and piscivore fish species and showed broader isotopic niche compared to
   most native species analysed. The isotopic niche of A. gigas
   significantly overlapped with most native fish species in one lake (i.e.
   Lake Mentiroso), while there was low niche overlap in the second (i.e.
   Lake Miraflores). Given its omnivorous tendencies, the predation impact
   of A. gigas on other fish species is likely less than currently claimed
   and likely varies with the food web structure of the ecosystem. More
   precise data on resource availability and use are necessary to infer
   whether niche overlap will have negative impacts on native fish species
   through potential competitive interactions. Increasing our understanding
   on the processes generating impact of these introductions on resident
   communities through food web ecology will pave the way for better

   structure of fish assemblages in the East (two sites) and the South (one
   site) Seas of Korea, and to compare the isotopic niche areas between the
   regions. To do this, we analyzed the community structures and the delta
   C-13 and delta N-15 values for fish assemblages, and their potential
   food sources collected during May and October 2020. There were spatial
   differences in the diversity and dominant species of fish assemblages
   between the two seas. The fish assemblages in the South Sea had
   relatively wide ranges of delta C-13 and delta N-15 (-22.4 parts per
   thousand to -15.3 parts per thousand and 7.4 parts per thousand to 13.8
   parts per thousand, respectively) compared to those (-22.1 parts per
   thousand to -18.0 parts per thousand and 9.8 parts per thousand to 13.6

   delta N-15 values of suspended particulate organic matter, zooplankton,
   and fish assemblages differed significantly among sites and between
   seasons (PERMANOVA, p < 0.05, in all cases). Moreover, isotopic niche
   indices were relatively higher in the South Sea compared to those in the
   East Sea. Such differences in food-web characteristics among sites are
   likely due to the specific environmental effects (especially, major
   currents) on the differences in the species compositions and, therefore,
   their trophic relationships. Overall, these results allow for a deeper

   difficult as a continuous record of their remains is difficult to
   obtain. Here we assess dietary change in seabirds from Guangjin Island,
   Xisha Archipelago, South China Sea, by using stable nitrogen isotopes in
   seabird bones and prey remains collected from a coral sand ornithogenic
   sediment profile. N-15 of seabird bone collagen varied from 11.7 parts
   per thousand to 14.1 parts per thousand (averaging 12.8 parts per
   thousand +/- 0.4 parts per thousand), but that of fish bones and scales
   showed minor variations. Flying fish and squid are two favorite foods of
   tropical seabirds, and the average values of muscle N-15 in typical
   flying fish and squid samples were 9.2 parts per thousand and 10.2 parts
   per thousand, respectively. Based on nitrogen isotope mass balance
   calculation, we conclude that flying fish accounts for 80\% +/- 40\% of
   seabird diet averaged over the past 1200 years, but this prey accounted
   for only about 37\% +/- 30\% during the Little Ice Age' (AD 1400-1850).
   Flying fish averaged up to 88\% +/- 2\% during the Medieval Warm Period'
   (AD 850-1200), close to modern observed value of 89.6\%. Thus, it
   appears that seabirds on Guangjin Island mainly preyed on flying fish
   during warm periods, and shift to squid during cooler periods. Our
   results suggest that recent global warming and human activities have
   likely caused a rapid decrease in tropical seabird population and

   we combined stomach content and stable isotope analyses to reconstruct

   Overall, our study showed that swordfish fed on a wide range of fish and
   cephalopod species from both pelagic and demersal habitats. A dietary
   shift towards increasing consumption of cephalopods and decreasing
   consumption of Gadiformes had been observed between 2012 and 2020.
   Stable isotope approaches revealed that gelatinous organisms were also
   important prey, particularly for smaller-sized swordfish. We underline

   Shells of the Bivalve Mollusk, <i>Arctica islandica</i>",FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,2021,8,NA,NA,NOV 2,"Bulk stable nitrogen isotope values of the carbonate-bound organic
   matrix in bivalve shells (delta N-15(CBOM)) are increasingly used to
   assess past food web dynamics, track anthropogenic nitrogen pollution
   and reconstruct hydrographic changes. However, it remains unresolved if
   the delta N-15(CBOM) values are also affected by directed ontogenetic
   trends which can bias ecological and environmental interpretations. This
   very aspect is tested here with modern and fossil specimens of the
   long-lived ocean quahog, Arctica islandica, collected from different
   sites and water depths in the NE Atlantic Ocean. As demonstrated, delta
   N-15(CBOM) values from the long chronologies show a general decrease
   through lifetime by -0.006 parts per thousand per year. The most likely
   reason for the observed delta N-15(CBOM) decline is a change in the type
   of proteins synthesized at different stages of life, i.e., a gradual
   shift from proteins rich in strongly fractionating, trophic amino acids
   during youth toward proteins rich in source amino acids during
   adulthood. Aside from this ontogenetic trend, distinct seasonal to
   multidecadal delta N-15(CBOM) variations (ca. 50 to 60 years; up to 2.90

   belowground food webs",ECOLOGY,2021,102,8,NA,AUG,"Size-structured food webs form integrated trophic systems where energy
   is channeled from small to large consumers. Empirical evidence suggests
   that size structure prevails in aquatic ecosystems, whereas in
   terrestrial food webs trophic position is largely independent of body
   size. Compartmentalization of energy channeling according to size
   classes of consumers was suggested as a mechanism that underpins
   functioning and stability of terrestrial food webs including those
   belowground, but their structure has not been empirically assessed
   across the whole size spectrum. Here we used stable isotope analysis and
   metabolic regressions to describe size structure and energy use in eight
   belowground communities with consumers spanning 12 orders of magnitude
   in living body mass, from protists to earthworms. We showed a negative
   correlation between trophic position and body mass in invertebrate
   communities and a remarkable nonlinearity in community metabolism and
   trophic positions across all size classes. Specifically, we found that
   the correlation between body mass and trophic level is positive in the
   small-sized (protists, nematodes, arthropods below 1 mu g in body mass),
   neutral in the medium-sized (arthropods of 1 mu g to 1 mg), and negative
   in the large-sized consumers (large arthropods, earthworms), suggesting
   that these groups form compartments with different trophic organization.
   Based on this pattern, we propose a concept of belowground food webs
   being composed of (1) size-structured micro-food web driving fast energy
   channeling and nutrient release, for example in microbial loop; (2)
   arthropod macro-food web with no clear correlation between body size and
   trophic level, hosting soil arthropod diversity and subsidizing
   aboveground predators; and (3) ``trophic whales,{''} sequestering energy
   in their large bodies and restricting its propagation to higher trophic
   levels in belowground food webs. The three size compartments are based
   on a similar set of basal resources, but contribute to different
   ecosystem-level functions and respond differently to variations in
   climate, soil characteristics and land use. We suggest that the widely
   used vision of resource-based energy channeling in belowground food webs
   can be complemented with size-based energy channeling, where ecosystem
   multifunctionality, biodiversity, and stability are supported by a
   balance across individual size compartments.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Potapov, AM (Corresponding Author), Russian Acad Sci, AN Severtsov Inst Ecol \& Evolut, Leninsky Prospect 33, Moscow 119071, Russia.

   and predator trophic dynamics",LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,2023,NA,NA,NA,2023 OCT 27,"Studies of Antarctic paleo-archives have produced conflicting hypotheses
   on the relative impact of long-term climate change and historic
   exploitation of marine mammals on Southern Ocean krill predator foraging
   ecology. We disentangle these hypotheses using amino acid stable isotope
   analysis on a 7000-yr Holocene archive of Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis
   adeliae) eggshells to differentiate variation in diet and trophic
   dynamics from baseline biogeochemical cycling as drivers of the rapid
   decline in krill predator bulk tissue delta 15N values in recent
   centuries. Contrary to previous hypotheses suggesting solely trophic
   dynamic mechanisms as drivers of this decline, we identified an abrupt
   decline in source amino acid delta 15N values, indicative of major
   changes in biogeochemical cycling at the base of the Southern Ocean food
   web that mirrored the decline in penguin bulk tissue delta 15N values.
   These abrupt shifts in penguin delta 15N values and associated
   biogeochemical cycling aligned with climatic events during the Little
   Ice Age that decreased surface delta 15NNO3-, likely connected to a
   proposed increase in Ekman upwelling via a southward migration of the
   Westerlies. This baseline shift was in addition to a long-term, gradual
   decline in penguin trophic position over the Holocene that began prior
   to both recent anthropogenic climate change and a proposed
   ``krill-surplus{''} following historic marine mammal exploitation in the
   19th and 20th centuries. In resolving these outstanding hypotheses about
   drivers of Southern Ocean food web dynamics, this study emphasizes the
   fundamental importance of climate-induced variability in biogeochemical
   cycling on ecological processes and improves the ability of
   paleo-archives to inform the ecological consequences of future

   fuel estuarine food webs. Here, we used stable carbon (C) and nitrogen
   (N) isotope analyses to compare how contributions of different POM
   sources (terrestrial, estuarine, and marine) to the diets of zooplankton
   and juvenile fishes differed between low and high river flow conditions,
   as well as spatially across a tropical estuary, Hilo Bay, Hawaii, USA.
   Diets of zooplankton and juvenile fishes were affected by river flow
   conditions, but the magnitude and the change in the basal resources
   depended on the location of the station in the estuary relative to the
   ocean and the river mouths. Consumers from the station most isolated
   from the ocean and with groundwater and overland flow inputs, utilized a
   combination of estuarine and terrestrial POM during both low and high
   river flow conditions and exhibited less variability in their basal
   resources than stations with direct ocean exchange. Consumers from
   stations in the Bay most affected by ocean exchange and river inputs
   utilized a combination of estuarine, terrestrial, and marine POM during
   low flow conditions, but shifted to marine and terrestrial POM during
   high river flow conditions. This shift to using terrestrial POM during
   high river flow conditions was substantial and up to 40\% higher than
   values measured in other estuaries. Factors suspected to be affecting
   which POM source(s) consumers use in Hilo Bay are gross primary
   production, biological availability of exported terrestrial OM, and
   estuarine bacteria biomass, all of which are affected by river flow.
   Overall, our results suggest that Hilo Bay's food web and possibly those
   from other tropical estuaries are vulnerable to changes in hydrology,

   based and one bacteria based, was studied in a mesocosm experiment using
   seawater from the northern Baltic Sea. Organisms included in the
   experiment were bacteria, phytoplankton, protozoa, and mesozooplankton
   (copepods). A phytoplankton-based food web was generated by incubating
   at a high light level with the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus (NP).
   A bacteria-based food web was created by adding carbon, nitrogen, and
   phosphorus (CNP) and incubating at a lower light level. In the CNP
   treatment bacteria dominated the productivity (91\%), while in the NP
   treatment phytoplankton were dominant producers (74\%). The
   phytoplankton community in the NP treatment was dominated by autotrophic
   nanoflagellates. The food web efficiency, defined as mesozooplankton
   productivity per basal productivity (phytoplankton + bacteria), was 22\%
   in the phytoplankton-based food web and 2\% in the bacteria-based food
   web. This discrepancy could be explained by 1-2 extra trophic levels in
   the bacteria-based food web where carbon passed through flagellates and
   ciliates before reaching mesozooplankton, while in the
   phytoplankton-based food web there was a direct pathway from
   phytoplankton to mesozooplankton. The results were supported by stable
   isotope analysis of mesozooplankton. We propose that climate change,

   <i>Limnomysis benedeni</i> from Lake Constance",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2017,7,12,4173-4178,JUN,"Understanding the ecological patterns of invasive species and their
   habitats require an understanding of the species' foraging ecology.
   Stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope values
   provide useful information into the study of animal ecology and
   evolution, since the isotope ratios of consumers reflect consumer's
   dietary patterns. Nevertheless, the lack of species- and
   element-specific laboratory-derived turnover rates could limit their
   application. Using a laboratory-based dual stable isotope tracer
   approach ((NaNO3)-N-15 and (NaHCO3)-C-13), we evaluated the delta N-15
   and delta C-13 isotope turnover rates in full-grown adult invasive
   Limnomysis benedeni from Lake Constance. We provide delta N-15 and delta
   C-13 turnover rates based on nonlinear least-squares regression and
   posterior linear regression models. Model precisions and fit were
   evaluated using Akaike's information criterion. Within a couple of days,
   the delta N-15 and delta C-13 of mysids began to change. Nevertheless,
   after about 14 days, L. benedeni did not reach equilibrium with their
   new isotope values. Since the experiment was conducted on adult
   subjects, it is evident that turnover was mainly influenced by
   metabolism (in contrast to growth). Unlike traditional dietary shifts,
   our laboratory-based dual stable isotope tracer approach does not shift
   the experimental organisms into a new diet and avoids dietary effects on
   isotope values. Results confirm the application of isotopic tracers to
   label mysid subpopulations and could be used to reflect assimilation and
   turnover from the labeled dietary sources. Field-based stable isotope
   studies often use isotopic mixing models commonly assuming diet-tissue
   steady state. Unfortunately, in cases where the isotopic composition of
   the animal is not in equilibrium with its diet, this can lead to highly
   misleading conclusions. Thus, our laboratory-based isotopic
   incorporation rates assist interpretation of the isotopic values from
   the field and provide a foundation for future research into using
   isotopic tracers to investigate invasion ecology.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Yohannes, E (Corresponding Author), Univ Konstanz, Limnol Inst, Constance, Germany.

   dietary differences in a generalist predator",ECOSPHERE,2022,13,9,NA,SEP,"Generalist species can exhibit individual specialization (IS), where
   individuals adopt specialized foraging behaviors not attributable to
   age, sex, or social dominance. While IS increases with the diversity of
   available foraging resources (ecological opportunity), the potential
   impact of human food subsidies on ecological opportunity is unknown. We
   quantified the isotopic niche width of Steller's Jays (Cyanocitta
   stelleri), a synanthropic predator and dietary generalist, across a
   gradient of human land-use categories ranging from subsidized (park
   campgrounds) to unsubsidized (forest interior) habitats in a protected
   area in California. We asked (1) if isotopic niche width was better
   predicted by individual foraging behavior than sex, social dominance, or
   habitat category (indicating IS) and (2) if degree of IS exhibited by
   jays increased with the availability of human food subsidies. We
   characterized the isotopic niche space occupied by individual jays
   relative to the population using carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta
   N-15) isotope values. Using linear models, we found that jay diet
   variation was best explained by individual behavior and habitat use
   rather than by sex or social dominance. While the degree of IS increased
   with the availability of human foods, individual jays exhibited a
   variety of foraging behaviors in all habitats that were segregated by
   foraging stratum and use of human foods. Individual diet also determined
   the degree of specialization, as jays that specialized on human foods
   had the narrowest niche width regardless of habitat. Management efforts
   targeted at generalist wildlife exhibiting large degrees of IS should
   therefore account for the impact of food subsidies on foraging behavior.
   Approaches that involve aversive conditioning may fail where highly
   specialized individuals are unlikely to encounter treatments; therefore,
   we recommend simultaneous efforts to limit human food subsidies (e.g.,
   information campaigns and improved containment of human food and food
   waste), and deployment across the largest possible extent of foraging
   microhabitats and substrates in order to ensure exposure of whole
   populations to emetic eggs.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"West, EH (Corresponding Author), Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Fisheries Wildlife \& Conservat Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.

   (stygofauna). Incorporation of sewage-derived organic matter (OM) into a
   shallow groundwater food web was studied using fluorescence and stable
   isotope signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-15). Organic pollution was
   hypothesised to limit sensitive species' abundances along the
   contamination gradient and isotope signatures of stygofauna consuming
   sewage-derived OM were expected to be enriched in delta N-15. Stygofauna
   communities near a sewage treatment plant in New Zealand were sampled
   over 4 months and microbial biofilms were incubated in situ on native
   gravel for 1 month. As anticipated, OM stress-subsidy gradients altered
   stygofauna composition: the biomass of oligochaetes and Paraleptamphopus
   amphipods increased in OM-enriched groundwater (higher dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) and tryptophan-like fluorescence), whereas other, probably
   less-tolerant taxa (e.g. ostracods, Dytiscidae) were absent. Isotopic
   signatures for stygofauna from polluted groundwater were consistent with
   assimilation of isotopically enriched sewage-N (delta N-15 values of
   7-16 parts per thousand), but highly depleted in delta C-13 relative to
   sewage. Negative C-13 discriminations probably occur in Paraleptamphopus
   amphipods, and may also occur in oligochaetes and Dytiscidae, a finding
   with implications for the application of delta C-13 for determining food

   contributed to the nutrition of all planktonic copepods and supported
   planktivorous nekton, but played a minor role in the benthic food web.
   Although phytoplankton could be utilized by all the consumers, low

   San Francisco Bay case study",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY,2004,38,17,4519-4526,SEP 1,"Chemical contaminants disrupt ecosystems, but specific effects may be
   under-appreciated when poorly known processes such as uptake mechanisms,
   uptake via diet, food preferences, and food web dynamics are
   influential. Here we show that a combination of food web structure and
   the physiology of trace element accumulation explain why some species in
   San Francisco Bay are threatened by a relatively low level of selenium
   contamination and some are not. Bivalves and crustacean zooplankton form
   the base of two dominant food webs in estuaries, The dominant bivalve
   Potamocorbula amurensis has a 10-fold slower rate constant of loss for
   selenium than do common crustaceans such as copepods and the mysid
   Neomysis mercedis (rate constant of loss, k(e) = 0.025, 0.155, and 0.25
   d(-1), respectively). The result is much higher selenium concentrations
   in the bivalve than in the crustaceans. Stable isotope analyses show
   that this difference is propagated up the respective food webs in San
   Francisco Bay. Several predators of bivalves have tissue concentrations
   of selenium that exceed thresholds thought to be associated with
   teratogenesis or reproductive failure (liver Se > 15 mug g(-1) dry
   weight). Deformities typical of selenium-induced teratogenesis were
   observed in one of these species. Concentrations of selenium in tissues
   of predators of zooplankton are less than the thresholds. Basic
   physiological and ecological processes can drive wide differences in
   exposure and effects among species, but such processes are rarely

   ALONG THE FLUVIAL GRADIENT OF A MESOAMERICAN COASTAL RIVER",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,2011,27,6,791-803,JUL,"Ecosystem processes and biological community structure are expected to
   change in a relatively predictable manner along fluvial gradients within
   river basins. Such predictions are heavily based on temperate rivers,
   and food web variation along fluvial gradients in Mesoamerican rivers
   has received limited attention. In this study, we analyzed carbon and
   nitrogen stable isotope ratios of basal carbon sources and dominant
   consumer species to examine aquatic food web structure along the fluvial
   gradient of the Monkey River Basin, Belize. Similar to previous studies
   in other regions, consumer species richness and functional diversity
   increased along the downstream fluvial gradient, due in part to the
   addition of estuarine species in lower reaches and increasing diversity
   of piscivorous species along the gradient. Aquatic food webs in upstream
   reaches were primarily supported by allochthonous production sources,
   and in-stream sources increased in importance along the downstream
   gradient. Our study system traversing the Maya Mountain Marine Area
   Transect also provided a unique opportunity to test the utility of
   primary consumer delta N-15 as an indicator of watershed impacts within
   a tropical basin with a diverse biota and a different type of
   agricultural impact than typically studied (i.e. banana plantations vs.
   tilled row cropping). As expected, primary consumer delta N-15 at sites
   draining impacted watersheds was enriched compared to values from
   forested reference sites. Assessment of primary consumer delta N-15 may
   be a feasible option for monitoring watershed impacts on aquatic food
   webs in service of the ridge-to-reef conservation strategy adopted for
   this watershed as well as in other tropical river basins. Copyright (C)

   food-web dynamics: A case study from the southwest sub-tropical Pacific",DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY,2015,113,SI,208-224,MAR,"This study investigated the food web structure of the oligotrophic
   picophytoplankton-dominated pelagic ecosystem in the vicinity of New
   Caledonia, within the Archipelagic Deep Basin (ARCH) province of the
   southwest sub-tropical Pacific. Nitrogen stable isotope (delta N-15)
   data were collected for mesozooplankton (0.2-2 mm), macrozooplankton
   (2-20 mm), micronelcton (20-200 mm) and nekton ( >200 mm) during
   2002-2004 and 2011. Using a coupled delta N-15 size-spectrum approach,
   we estimated (1) organism trophic level (TL); (2) food chain length
   (FCL); (3) predator prey mass ratio (PPMR); and (4) transfer efficiency
   (TE). The role of phytoplankton size structure in determining these
   parameters was investigated. Applying atrophic enrichment factor (TEF)
   of 3.4, maximum TL was calculated at similar to 5. The number of TLs
   spanned by each length class was 1.97 for mesozooplankton, 2.07 for
   macrozooplankton, 2.75 for micronekton, and 2.21 for nekton. Estimated
   PPMR was 10,099:1 for mesozooplankton, 3683:1 for
   macrozooplankton/micronekton, and 2.44 x 10(5):1 for nekton,
   corresponding to TEs of 6.3\%, 8.5\% and 2.4\%, respectively. PPMR and
   TE were strongly influenced by the TEF used, and TEF 3.4 likely over and
   underestimated PPMR and TE, respectively, for mesozooplankton and
   macrozooplankton/micronekton. Comparatively low PPMR for mesozooplankton
   and macrozooplankton/micronekton indicated longer food chains and higher
   connectivity within these groups than for the nekton. Conversely, the
   high PPMR yet high trophic niche width for the nekton indicated that
   they prey primarily on macrozooplankton/micronekton, with a relatively
   high degree of dietary specialisation. Our results are discussed in the
   context of other marine food webs. The ARCH food chain was found to be
   1-1.5 trophic levels longer than the eutrophic
   micro-/nanophytoplankton-dominated Californian upwelling system,
   providing empirical support for the role of phytoplankton size in
   determining FCL Group specific PPMR estimates demonstrated that it is
   changes in trophic pathways across the mesozooplankton/macrozooplankton/
   micronekton groups that are primarily responsible for higher FCL under
   oligotrophic conditions. Finally, we discuss consistently low delta N-15
   values to the east of New Caledonia, and implications for the
   contribution of diazotroph nitrogen to the pelagic food web in this
   region. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   matter (POM) and sympatric copepods within the epipelagic zone (similar
   to 200 m depth) in the East Sea during spring based on stable isotope
   analysis (SIA). The SIA indicated that interspecific differences in the
   prey size and vertical segregation of feeding migration range among
   copepods may promote niche partitioning among sympatric copepods in each
   region of the subpolar front (SPF). Additionally, our results showed
   remarkable differences in the copepod community structure and resource
   utilization across the SPF. The south region of the East Sea showed
   higher species richness of copepods than the north region, while
   copepods that fed mainly on POM in the surface and subsurface
   chlorophyll maximum layers showed smaller body sizes in the south
   region. These results revealed that the food chain between primary
   producers and higher trophic levels was longer in the south region than
   in the north region. Additionally, delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of
   copepods increased gradually with the body size increase whereas delta
   N-15 values in the north region showed the reverse trend. Latter results
   could be attributed to the consumption of deep-layer POM in small
   copepods. Therefore, we suggest that northward shifts in the
   distribution of copepods under global warming may decrease energy
   efficiency in the pelagic ecosystem of the East Sea.",MDPI,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Suh, HL (Corresponding Author), Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Oceanog, Gwangju 61186, South Korea.

Article,Geraldine C. Taylor and Olaf L. F. Weyl and Jaclyn M. Hill and Richard A. Peel and Clinton J. Hay,"Comparing the fish assemblages and food-web structures of large
   floodplain rivers",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2017,62,11,1891-1907,NOV,"1. The Upper Zambezi, Kavango and Kwando are large floodplain rivers
   with substantial biodiversity, providing water and ecosystem services to
   a large tract of southern Africa. These rivers differ in hydrological
   regime. The Upper Zambezi and Kavango rivers are in flood for 4months
   (March, April, May, June) while, in the Kwando River, floods are later
   and last for 1-2months in July and August. The Upper Zambezi River has
   the largest annual flood pulse, followed by the Kavango River, while the
   Kwando River experiences small and unreliable floods. During years of
   exceptional flooding of the Upper Zambezi and Kavango rivers, the rivers
   are interconnected at peak flows and therefore share a common
   ichthyofauna. This provided a natural experiment to investigate the
   responses of fish communities comprised of the same species to differing
   flood regimes by comparing the fish assemblages and food-web structures
   between rivers.
   2. Fish assemblage structure was characterised by analysing biomass
   catch per unit effort data collected using gillnets in all water-level
   seasons for all three rivers. Whole ecosystem-stable isotope data
   collected once from each river were used to examine differences in
   food-web structure and fish feeding ecology between rivers. Due to
   temporal differences in hydrology, the Upper Zambezi and Kavango river
   food webs were characterised during the low and falling water seasons,
   while the Kwando River food web was sampled during the rising water
   season.
   3. In the Upper Zambezi and Kavango rivers, fish assemblages varied with
   hydrological season due to the homogenising influence of the flood
   pulse, while in the Kwando River fish assemblages did not change
   seasonally.
   4. The Upper Zambezi River food web had a restricted nitrogen range
   (NR=0.90), with a reduced food chain length and predators did not occupy
   elevated trophic positions compared to those in the Kavango and Kwando
   river food webs (NR=1.05 and 0.97 respectively). The Kwando and Kavango
   rivers are less exploited than the heavily fished Upper Zambezi River,
   where fishing has reduced the abundance of primary and tertiary
   consumers, potentially resulting in the observed reduction in food chain
   length. The Upper Zambezi and Kavango river food webs were based on
   differing basal resources compared to the Kwando River food web. The
   Upper Zambezi and Kavango river food webs were likely supported by
   C-13-enriched resources such as C4 riparian vegetation fromthe
   floodplain, while the Kwando River food web was likely based on
   C-13-depleted resources such as filamentous algae and aquatic
   macrophytes.
   5. The influence of the varying flood pulses on the fish communities of
   these three rivers supports the flood pulse concept. There is also
   evidence that food-web structures differ between rivers but, due to
   differing hydrological regimes in the rivers, further study is required
   to understand causal factors. These ecosystems are increasingly impacted
   by human population growth and development, as well as climate change,
   and improved predictions in fish community and food-web structure in
   relation to flood pulse changes are important for ecosystem management
   in future.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Hill, JM (Corresponding Author), SAIAB, Grahamstown, South Africa.

   <i>Cacosceles newmannii</i> (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae, Prioninae),
   inferred from stable isotopes",AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY,2021,23,3,378-387,AUG,"An outbreak of Cacosceles newmannii (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) was
   detected for the first time on sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) in 2015 in
   KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Although primary host plants of this native
   species remain unknown, these are central to testing hypotheses
   concerning the outbreak.
   We hypothesized that this species has undergone a host plant shift (i.e.
   a feeding association with a novel host plant).
   We compared delta C-13 and delta N-15 ratios of adult beetles retrieved
   from South African museum collections, collected between 1891 and 2016
   (n = 23; `pre-outbreak'), with samples from infested fields in 2017 (n =
   9, `post-outbreak') and in 2019 (n = 23, `post-outbreak'), as well as
   diverse, plausible host plants (n = 42 samples across 10 species) from
   infested fields and surrounding patches of indigenous and commercial
   forest vegetation. We used Bayesian isotope mixing models to infer the
   relative contribution of the different plants to the diet of C.
   newmannii.
   Pre-outbreak, C-3 plants contributed strongly to the larval diet,
   whereas post-outbreak, C-4 plants were the largest component of their
   diet. There was some indication of C-4 plants contributing to their diet
   pre-outbreak.
   Our results suggest that the outbreak of this polyphagous beetle was not
   a dramatic host shift but rather a rapid increase in the proportion of
   C-4 plants already in their diet.
   We concluded that plants from the families Fabaceae and Poaceae are the
   most likely host plants of this species. Nevertheless, the drivers of
   this rapid outbreak on sugarcane remain poorly determined and should be
   the focus of future research.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Terblanche, JS (Corresponding Author), Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Invas Biol, Dept Conservat Ecol \& Entomol, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.

   chrysoura, during a period of environmental changes",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,2017,575,NA,137-152,JUL 20,"Accurate knowledge on fish trophic ecology and its modifications is
   crucial for understanding the impact of global change on ecosystems. In
   this context, we investigated the value of the delta C-13 and delta N-15
   of otolith soluble organic matter (SOM) for identifying temporal diet
   shifts in American silver perch Bairdiella chrysoura over a 30-yr period
   characterized by strong changes in its population size and habitats
   within the Terminos Lagoon (Mexico). We first compared the otolith SOM
   isotopic signatures from present-clay adults to those of muscle and the
   main local prey. Our results suggest that otolith SOM can be confidently
   extracted and analyzed for both present and past otoliths of this
   species. The mean otolith SOM signatures obtained (-15.92 +/- 1.35\%,
   for delta C-13 and 9.38 +/- 0.93\%, for delta N-15) were consistent with
   those of the diet as 85\% of the individual signatures were included
   within the prey isotopic niche area. Moreover, this study supports a
   trophic enrichment factor between diet and otolith (TEFdiet-otolith)
   close to 0 for delta N-15, while for delta C-13, the TEFololith-muscle
   of +0.02\% warrants further investigation. Then, we compared past and
   contemporary otolith SOM signatures to investigate temporal diet shifts
   in B. chrysoura. This showed that 613C and delta N-15 differed
   significantly between the past and present period even if the temporal
   shift remained relatively small (respectively +1.17\%, and 0.55\%). The
   present study substantiates the use of otolith SOM delta C-13 and delta
   N-15 as a proxy of fish present and past trophic position, opening the
   possibility for major progress in studies of temporal changes in food

   width in wild blue mussels (<i>Mytilus edulis</i>)",JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS,2016,157,NA,118-123,MAY,"Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) are boreo-temperate, filter-feeding
   bivalves common to intertidal areas. As filter feeders they have been
   employed in open-water, multi-tropic aquaculture systems to reduce
   organic benthic loading though the exploitation of suspended particulate
   organic materials. We compared delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures and
   the isotopic niches of mussels growing in, and adjacent to, an
   integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) farm in British Columbia,
   Canada, and using this information evaluated the contribution of
   aquaculture-derived effluent to their diet. Farm-sampled mussels had the
   least intraspecific isotopic variation compared to mussels sampled at
   the reference site. The interaction between time (i.e. sampling dates)
   and site did not significantly affect the isotopic composition of
   mussels; however significant variation was detected in delta N-15 values
   as a function of sampling date and particulate organic matter. A
   two-source isotopic mixing model indicated that marine particulate
   organic matter and IMTA farm effluent were approximately equal in
   importance (similar to 46 \% and similar to 54 \%, respectively) to the
   diet of IMTA-retrieved mussels. Uptake of IMTA farm waste by M. edulis
   supports their use as economic extractives while also mitigating farmed
   sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) nutrient loading to the aquatic

   BCE: Before Common Era) are key periods in the origin and evolution of
   ancient civilizations in China since the periods include the processes
   and mechanisms of social development in the Central Plains of China
   during the Bronze Age. However, human-environment interactions in the
   context of trans-Eurasia cultural exchange during that time are not
   well-understood. In this study, isotopic analysis and radiocarbon dating
   of human and animal bones from Xinancheng cemetery in southeast Shanxi
   Province are reported. It was deduced that, for the period similar to
   1000-800 BCE, humans buried in Xinancheng cemetery relied primarily on
   C-4-based foods and upper-status individuals consumed more animal
   protein and probablyC(3) crops. Also, considering the paleoclimate and
   other archaeological data of the Central Plains, the human diet and
   subsistence strategies changed significantly with more C-3 staples such
   as wheat being consumed during the Eastern Zhou (770-221 BCE), as
   evidenced by an increased intake of wheat by lower-status individuals
   and the development of a mixed wheat and millet agricultural system. It
   is argued that the socio-economic change around the late western
   Zhou-early eastern Zhou Dynasty occurred as a result of the necessity to
   adapt to the aggravation caused by climate deterioration and population
   pressures, factors which profoundly influenced the economic and
   lifestyle patterns in ancient China. The socio-economic system of the
   Eastern Zhou Dynasty displayed more resilience to climate change than

   change at the Neolithic transition in north-west Europe, indicating an

   consumption of marine foods on an occasional basis. This suggests that
   marine foods may have been consumed as a crucial supplementary resource
   in times of famine, when the newly introduced cereal crops failed to
   cope with the demanding climate of Shetland. This isotopic evidence is
   consistent with the presence of marine food debris in contemporary

   species and regions. In recent decades, changes in atmospheric forcing
   and sea surface temperature have been particularly pronounced in the
   Gulf of Alaska and eastern Bering Sea, impacting the food webs in which

   analysis of nitrogen in amino acids to estimate historic and modern

   Eumetopias jubatus in the Gulf of Alaska and Bristol Bay. We applied a
   Bayesian hierarchical framework to determine whether shared trends
   through time exist across pinnipeds (classified by region and species)
   on decadal scales. Model results identified both shared trends through
   time and classification-specific decadal changes in pinniped trophic
   position. The largest change in trophic position occurred in the 2000s
   and 2010s and was observed in both Steller sea lions (median: 2.8) and
   harbor seals (median: 3.1) in the Gulf of Alaska, but not harbor seals
   in Bristol Bay or Iliamna Lake. Divergent trophic position patterns in
   the 2000s were identified in the western stock of Steller sea lions,
   which increased in trophic position, and sympatric harbor seals in the
   northern Gulf of Alaska, which decreased in trophic position. Our

   environmental changes within an ecosystem and to monitor shifts in
   community dynamics. Using stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon (delta
   N-15 and delta C-13) in polar bear Ursus maritimus guard hairs, we
   examined their diet in the Canadian Beaufort Sea from 2003 to 2011. We
   investigated how delta N-15 and delta C-13 were related to population
   demographics, sea ice dynamics, climate indices, air temperatures, and
   ringed seal Pusa hispida ovulation rates. Bayesian stable isotope models
   were used to determine annual variation in prey contributions and niche
   widths. Diet contributions from ringed seal, bowhead whale Balaena
   mysticetus, beluga Delphinapterus leucas, and bearded seal Erignathus
   barbatus varied by sex, reproductive status, and year. Polar bear ringed
   seal consumption was lowest and niche widths were highest in 2004
   following ringed seal reproductive failure in the early 2000s, and polar
   bear delta N-15 decreased when ringed seal ovulation rate was high.
   Polar bear delta N-15 and delta C-13 were linked to capture locations,
   which may reflect geographic gradients in stable isotopes within the
   Beaufort Sea. Climate indices were not related to polar bear delta N-15
   and delta C-13. Sea ice dynamics were related to polar bear delta C-13,
   suggesting that the bears' diets shift in response to environmental

   Southwestern Atlantic Ocean",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,2015,538,NA,23-34,OCT 28,"Food chain length is known to increase with primary productivity,
   species richness and environmental stability. Primary productivity and
   species richness decrease poleward at mid and high latitudes in the
   Southwestern Atlantic, and hence food chain length of coastal ecosystems
   is expected to decrease poleward, unless seasonal changes in water
   temperature destabilise food webs at mid latitude. We used stable
   isotopes of carbon and nitrogen and SIBER (Stable Isotope Bayesian
   Ellipses in R) to determine the food chain length and other patterns of
   interconnections (i.e. topology) of coastal food webs from 3 contrasting
   regions: the temperate estuarine zone associated with the Rio de la
   Plata plume, the tidal zone off northern and central Patagonia, and the
   cold estuarine zone off southern Patagonia. Results indicate that food
   chain length decreases and trophic redundancy increases as latitude
   increases in all of the compartments of the food web considered. This is
   in agreement with results emerging from reconstructions of marine food
   web length during the late Holocene in the same regions, thus suggesting
   that they are not artefacts caused by the intense exploitation of top
   predators in the region since European settlement. Furthermore,
   differences in primary productivity do not fully explain the observed
   patterns. Instead, we argue that the latitudinal reduction of species
   diversity reported for the Southwestern Atlantic may be the primary
   reason for the observed pattern. The reduction in the diversity of
   forage fishes and squids at high latitude is proposed to result into a
   wasp-waist ecosystem, characterised by a high trophic redundancy at high

   linked, and both are indispensable in evaluating ecosystem development
   in lakes under multiple anthropogenic stressors. However, model-based
   approaches concerning the changes in food web structure and ecosystem
   functioning in a certain lake during distinct periods are scarce. In
   this study, we focus on Lake Chaohu, the fifth-largest lake in China,
   which has undergone drastic changes over the last several decades. Data
   from the 1950s, 1980s and 2000s were used to create three Ecopath
   mass-balance models. These Ecopath models were validated by the stable
   isotope-determined trophic level (TL) for each functional group, which
   indicated an acceptable model performance. Overtime, we observed a
   collapse of the food web toward a simplified structure and decreasing
   biodiversity and trophic interactions. The lake ecosystem was
   approaching an immature but stable status from the 1950s to the 2000s,
   as indicated by the multiple related indicators and the distribution of
   energy flows in slow detrital-based and fast primary producer-based
   channels. We further discuss the potential driving factors and
   underlying mechanisms, hypothesizing that hydrological regulation may
   play a significant role in driving all of these changes in Lake Chaohu
   in addition to eutrophication and intensive fishery. Overall, we
   strongly advocate the identification of a threshold in abundance of
   zooplanktivorous fish, an integrated strategy for future ecological
   restoration in Lake Chaohu, and the consideration of using Ecopath as a
   new management tool for other lakes, thereby bridging the strategies
   from both environmental and ecological perspectives. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   IN THE GEORGIA BIGHT",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,1992,89,2,197-214,OCT,"Measurement of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta-C-13 and
   delta-N-15) in samples of human bone collagen (n = 93) from a temporal
   series of four prehistoric (early preagricultural, late preagricultural,
   early agricultural, late agricultural) and two historic (early contact,
   late contact) periods from the Georgia Bight, a continental embayment on
   the southeastern U.S. Atlantic coast, reveals a general temporal trend
   for less negative delta-C-13 values and less positive delta-N-15 values.
   This trend reflects a concomitant decrease in emphasis on marine
   resources and increased reliance on C4-based resources, especially
   maize. This dietary reorientation is most apparent for the early
   agricultural sample (AD 1150-1300), coinciding with the Mississippian
   florescence in the eastern United States. There is, however, a shift
   toward the use of C3 (non-maize) foods during the last prehistoric
   period (AD 1300-1450), which is likely related to environmental stress
   and social disruption. A heavier use of maize and terrestrial resources
   in general after the establishment of mission centers on barrier islands
   is indicated. A reduced dietary breadth during the mission period may
   have contributed to the extinction of these populations in the

   system",HYDROBIOLOGIA,2010,646,1,327-336,JUN,"Food web structure is well known to vary widely among ecosystems. Recent
   research indicates that there can be a high degree of spatial
   heterogeneity within ecosystems as well. Xochimilco is a small
   heterogeneous freshwater system that has been transformed into a network
   of canals, small lakes, and wetlands. Located within Mexico City, this
   ecosystem has been intensively managed and highly impacted for more than
   50 years. This system receives urban and agricultural runoff, with
   resulting impacts on water quality. The aquatic community is dominated
   by exotics such as carp (Cyprinus carpio) and tilapia (Oreocrhomis
   niloticus), though the system still supports endemic species such as the
   aquatic salamander, axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum), and crayfish
   (Cambarellus montezumae), which are both endangered. In this study, we
   used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes for the whole food web and gut
   content analysis from the exotic fishes to describe food web structure
   in different canals within Xochimilco. There were significant isotopic
   differences among canals. These differences may result from isotopic
   baseline differences as well as differences in actual food web
   structure: both are related to local spatial variation in water quality
   driven by nutrient inputs and exotic fishes. Within-ecosystem
   variability is likely to be seen in other perturbed shallow systems as
   well, and should be explicitly considered in future food web studies.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Article; Proceedings Paper,English,"Zambrano, L (Corresponding Author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Dept Zool, Inst Biol, Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04200, DF, Mexico.

   in Antarctica, which, in turn, influences food web dynamics. To
   investigate how sea ice dynamics are reflected in food web structure, we
   measured the trophic level and composition of basal organic matter
   supporting the prey base of 2 benthic and 2 pelagic ice fish species
   collected from sites along a gradient in sea ice persistence in McMurdo
   Sound, Ross Sea, Antarctica. Stable isotope analysis (delta N-15 and
   delta C-13) was carried out on samples collected from multiple sites
   during 2008 and 2012 to 2014. General linear models revealed that
   `trophic position' differed among species at a single site, and within
   benthic species among sites distributed along the gradient in sea ice
   persistence. Benthic species located at the southernmost sites in
   McMurdo Sound derived the highest proportion of diet from food webs
   supported by the sea ice microbial community (SIMCO), an important
   subsidy of organic matter to the sea-floor environment. Increased
   thickness and persistence of sea ice in McMurdo Sound due to the
   presence of icebergs resulted in a higher proportion of diet derived
   from SIMCO for the ice fish Trematomus bernacchii in 2008 compared to
   the 2012 to 2014 period. Analyses of dispersion for individual trophic
   positions revealed that individual level specialisation was lowest at
   sites with the highest variability in sea ice cover. These results
   provide evidence for linkages between sea ice dynamics and food web
   structure, and highlight the role of ice fishes as sentinels for
   environmental and ecological changes in Antarctica.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",Article,English,"McMullin, RM (Corresponding Author), Univ Otago, Dept Marine Sci, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.

   fjord: a multi-biomarker approach",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,2017,567,NA,139-156,MAR 13,"It is generally agreed that pelagic-benthic coupling is tight on Arctic
   shelves, i.e. that organic matter produced in the surface layers
   supports the seafloor and benthos. However, this paradigm is mainly
   based on the assumption that phytoplankton and ice algae are the main
   sources of carbon for the benthic communities. Climate change is
   expected to alter the relative contribution of food sources for benthic
   organisms. Macroalgal biomass is predicted to increase in near-shore
   systems in response to increased temperature and reduced sea ice cover.
   Thus, a better understanding of the relative contribution of benthic and
   pelagic components in benthic food webs in the Arctic is needed. In this
   study, a multi-biomarker approach (stable isotopes, fatty acid trophic
   markers, and compound-specific stable isotope analysis) was applied to
   link potential sources of carbon, including particulate organic matter
   from subsurface and bottom waters, sediment organic matter, and 6
   macroalgal species to the diet of the bivalve Astarte elliptica
   collected below the euphotic zone in a sub-Arctic fjord (Kobbefjord,
   Greenland). Results showed that A. elliptica feeds on particulate and
   sediment organic matter and that brown macroalgae significantly support
   the Arctic benthic food web. Multi-biomarker approaches can be used to
   determine the diet of benthic organisms and track temporal variability
   in sources of food. It therefore appears to be an interesting method to
   study food regime strategies in response to changing primary production

   acids and stable isotopes",POLAR BIOLOGY,2018,41,1,149-162,JAN,"Polar cod (Boreogadus saida) is one of the most studied Arctic marine
   fishes given its circumpolar distribution and centralised role in the
   Arctic marine food web. In contrast, relatively little is known about
   two other Arctic Gadidae: saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis) and Greenland
   cod (Gadus ogac). Climate change is expected to have an effect on sea
   ice-associated species, such as polar cod, but due to our lack of
   knowledge of other arctic gadid species it remains unclear how climate
   change will impact them and their interactions within the arctic marine
   ecosystem. Here, we explored the ecology of three Arctic Gadidae that
   co-occur in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. Stable isotope (SI) (niche
   overlap) and fatty acid (FA) (correspondence analysis and linear
   discriminant analysis) biomarkers were used to assess among- and
   within-species differences and trophic niche. Despite the close habitat
   proximity of saffron cod and polar cod while on the shelf, trophic niche
   characterisation revealed only a marginal overlap. Marginal niche
   overlaps also occurred for the two coastal species with similar diets,
   saffron cod and Greenland cod, likely reflecting regional-scale
   differences between two habitats. Within-species, polar cod collected

   Establishment in Lake Champlain",TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,2018,147,5,939-947,SEP,"Invasions and deliberate introductions of new prey species are likely to
   affect the prey choice and trophic level of resident predators. Rainbow
   Smelt Osmerus mordax and Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus are common prey
   fish species in lakes throughout North America, either as native or
   nonnative species. The establishment of Alewives in the 2000s in a lake
   with a native Rainbow Smelt population (Lake Champlain) presented an
   opportunity to study changes in the diet and trophic level of fish
   already established in the system. Using stable isotope analysis, we
   found that Alewives became a major component of predator diets, in
   particular of the diets of Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar and Walleye
   Sander vitreus. Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush consumed relatively few
   Alewives. For Walleyes (the predator with both pre- and post-Alewife
   isotope ratios available), the N-15 values decreased significantly from
   the pre-Alewife period of the late 1990s, indicating that Walleyes feed
   at lower trophic levels when Alewives are present. Predation on Alewives
   was correlated with the amount of spatial overlap of predators and prey.
   Our results show that the introduction of Alewives has altered the
   predator-prey linkages in Lake Champlain, alterations that can have
   major effects on food web structure and trophic cascades.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Simonin, PW (Corresponding Author), Cornell Univ, Cornell Univ Biol Field Stn, Dept Nat Resources, Bridgeport, NY 13030 USA.

Article,C Gratton and RF Denno,"Arthropod food web restoration following removal of an invasive wetland
   plant",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,2006,16,2,622-631,APR,"Restoration of habitats impacted by invasive plants is becoming an
   increasingly important tool in the management of native biodiversity,
   though most studies do not go beyond monitoring the abundance of
   particular taxonomic groups, Such as the return of native vegetation.
   Yet, the reestablishment of trophic interactions among organisms in
   restored habitats is equally important if we are to monitor and
   understand how ecosystems recover. This study examined whether food web
   interactions among arthropods (as inferred by abundance of naturally
   occurring stable isotopes of C {[}delta C-13] and N {[}delta N-15]) were
   reestablished in the restoration of a coastal Spartina alterniflora salt
   marsh that had been invaded by Phragmites australis.
   From patterns of C and N stable isotopes we infer that trophic
   interactions among arthropods in the native salt marsh habitats are
   characterized by reliance on the dominant marsh plant Spartina as a
   basal resource. Herbivores such as delphacid planthoppers and mirid bugs
   have isotope signatures characteristic of Spartina, and predatory
   arthropods such as dolicopodid flies and spiders likewise have delta
   C-13 and delta N-15 signatures typical of Spartina-derived resources
   (approximately -13 parts per thousand and 10 parts per thousand,
   respectively). Stable isotope patterns also suggest that the invasion of
   Phragmites into salt marshes and displacement of Spartina significantly
   alter arthropod food web interactions. Arthropods in
   Phragmites-dominated sites have delta C-13 isotope values between -18
   parts per thousand and -20 parts per thousand, suggesting reliance on
   detritus and/or benthic microalgae as basal resources and not on
   Phragmites, which has a 813 C approximately -26 parts per thousand.
   Since most Phragmites herbivores are either feeding internally or are
   rare transients from nearby Spartina, these resources do not provide
   significant prey resources for other arthropod consumers. Rather,
   predator isotope signatures in the invaded habitats indicate dependence
   on detritus/algae as basal resources instead of the dominant vegetation.
   The reestablishment of Spartina after removal of Phragmites, however,
   not only returned species assemblages typical of reference (uninvaded)
   Spartina, but stable isotope signatures suggest that the trophic
   interactions among the arthropods were also similar in reestablished
   habitats. Specifically, both herbivores and predators showed
   characteristic Spartina signatures, suggesting the return of the
   original grazer-based food web structure in the restored habitats.",ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Article,English,"Denno, RF (Corresponding Author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, 444 Russell Labs,1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

   understood. Through the use of stomach contents analysis, stable isotope
   signatures, and Bayesian mixing models, the food web of a tropical
   wetland in the gulf of California was investigated. Consumers had
   heterogeneous diets, omnivores were the most abundant species (47\%),
   followed by planktivorous (21\%), minor piscivores (10\%), major
   piscivores (10\%), macrobenthivores (9\%), and herbivores (3\%). The
   values of delta C-13 (from -12 to -29 parts per thousand) and delta N-15
   (from 4 to 24 parts per thousand) showed a wide range of isotopic values
   of the consumers. Most of the species had a broad isotopic niche and
   there was a large diet overlap of species due to the exploitation of a
   common set of food resources. Five trophic levels were identified, with
   the weakfish (Cynoscion xanthulus) as the top predator of this system
   with detritus coming from the mangrove as the main source that supports
   the food chain. This highlights the importance of the mangrove forests
   to such ecosystems, because not only they are the most important primary
   food source, but also, they offer habitat to a large suite of fauna,

   assessment using δ<SUP>13</SUP>C and δ<SUP>15</SUP>N analyses",POLAR BIOLOGY,2011,34,4,521-532,APR,"The benthos of the southeastern Chukchi Sea shelf is typified by high
   faunal abundance and biomass resulting from settlement of a large
   proportion of seasonal phytoplankton under highly nutritious offshore
   Bering Shelf Anadyr Water (BSAW). In contrast, inshore Alaska Coastal
   Water (ACW) is much less productive. Yet the Chukchi Bight and Kotzebue
   Sound, located under ACW in the southeastern Chukchi Sea, contain a
   substantial faunal abundance and biomass of invertebrates, fishes and
   marine mammals. We examined food web structure to gain an understanding
   of how a relatively rich benthic fauna with a high biomass can be
   supported under ACW with a supposedly low flux of carbon to the benthos.
   We measured stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) values of
   selected organisms (from zooplankton to fishes) as markers of food
   sources and trophic position to compare fauna on the shelf under BSAW
   with that in the Chukchi Bight and Kotzebue Sound under ACW. Relative
   isotope position of organisms in all three regions was similar, even
   though some pelagic species within the Sound were depleted in delta C-13
   compared to the other regions. We attribute the depletion to the
   influence of terrestrially derived carbon. We suggest that the
   hydrodynamics along an oceanic front between the Chukchi Shelf and the
   Chukchi Bight support the advection of nutrient-rich POC into the Bight
   and Sound as additional food sources to local production. We conclude
   that local conditions and multiple POC sources in the Bight and Sound
   support the substantial population of benthic invertebrates and the
   fishes, seabirds, and marine mammals that feed on them.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Article,English,"Iken, K (Corresponding Author), Univ Alaska, Inst Marine Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.

   Climate-Related Features in Continental Lakes",WATER,2021,13,10,NA,MAY,"Disentangling the effects of climate change on nature is one of the main
   challenges facing ecologists nowadays. Warmer climates forces strong
   effects on lake biota for fish, leading to a reduction in size, changes
   in diet, more frequent reproduction, and stronger cascading effects.
   Space-for-time substitution studies (SFTS) are often used to unravel
   climate effects on lakes biota; however, results from continental lakes
   are potentially confounded by biogeographical and evolutionary
   differences, also leading to an overall higher fish species richness in
   warm lakes. Such differences may not be found in lakes on remote
   islands, where natural fish free lakes have been subjected to stocking
   only during the past few hundred years. We studied 20 species-poor lakes
   located in two remote island groups with contrasting climates, but
   similar seasonality: the Faroe Islands (cold; 6.5 +/- 2.8 degrees C
   annual average (SD) and the Azores Islands (warm; 17.3 +/- 2.9 degrees
   C)). As for mainland lakes, mean body size of fish in the warmer lakes
   were smaller overall, and phytoplankton per unit of phosphorus higher.
   The delta C-13 carbon range for basal organisms, and for the whole food
   web, appeared wider in colder lakes. In contrast to previous works in
   continental fresh waters, Layman metrics of the fish food web were
   similar between the two climatic regions. Our results from insular
   systems provide further evidence that ambient temperatures, at least
   partially, drive the changes in fish size structure and the cascading
   effects found along latitude gradients in lakes.",MDPI,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Vidal, N (Corresponding Author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Vejlsovej 25, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark.

   diversity of alpine stream food webs",ECOGRAPHY,2019,42,9,1523-1535,SEP,"Alpine streams can exhibit naturally high levels of flow intermittency.
   However, how flow intermittency in alpine streams affects ecosystem
   functions such as food web trophic structure is virtually unknown. Here,
   we characterized the trophic diversity of aquatic food webs in 28
   headwater streams of the Val Roseg, a glacierized alpine catchment. We
   compared stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) trophic indices to
   high temporal resolution data on flow intermittency. Overall trophic
   diversity, food chain length and diversity of basal resource use did not
   differ to a large extent across streams. In contrast, gradient and
   mixing model analysis indicated that primary consumers assimilated
   proportionally more periphyton and less allochthonous organic matter in
   more intermittent streams. Higher coarse particulate organic matter
   (CPOM) C:N ratios were an additional driver of changes in
   macroinvertebrate diets. These results indicate that the trophic base of
   stream food webs shifts away from terrestrial organic matter to
   autochthonous organic matter as flow intermittency increases, most
   likely due to reduced CPOM conditioning in dry streams. This study
   highlights the significant, yet gradual shifts in ecosystem function
   that occur as streamflow becomes more intermittent in alpine streams. As
   alpine streams become more intermittent, identifying which functional
   changes occur via gradual as opposed to threshold responses is likely to

   paradoxical loser in an invasion meltdown scenario?",BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,2010,12,10,3439-3448,OCT,"Micropterus salmoides is a North American piscivorous fish on the IUCN
   list of 100 of the world's worst invasive alien species. Introduced into
   Lake Naivasha (Kenya) in 1929, their current population abundance is
   significantly depressed in a lake that has recently become dominated by
   fishes of the Cyprinidae family; the introduced cyprinid Cyprinus carpio
   now dominates catches in the commercial fishery and Barbus paludinous is
   now numerically dominant in the fish community. Long-term diet studies
   of M. salmoides based on gut contents analysis (GCA) have defined their
   diet spectrum, feeding preferences and ontogenetic dietary shifts.
   Between 1987 and 1991, diet was size-structured; fish < 260 mm were
   mainly insectivorous and fish > 260 mm fed mainly on invasive crayfish
   Procambarus clarkia with B. paludinosus rarely taken. More recent GCA
   data revealed that up to 2003, these size-structured trophic
   relationships were still evident, but there has been a subsequent shift
   to their feeding almost exclusively on small (< 100 mm) B. paludinosus,
   coincident with a size-related functional switch whereby M. salmoides >
   120 mm were now piscivorous. However, a Bayesian stable isotope mixing
   model (SIAR) suggested M. salmoides diet actually remained relatively
   varied in 2006 and 2007; it indicated P. clarkii were still contributing
   more to their diet than B. paludinosus in fish < 260 mm and provided
   only partial support for the functional shift. The consequence of the M.
   salmoides depressed population abundance is their predation pressure on
   prey fishes is limited and preventing top-down effects. This is in
   contrast to their invasive populations elsewhere in the world and the
   likely result of invasion meltdown processes in Naivasha involving the
   introduced C. carpio and P. clarkii that have produced sub-optimal
   foraging conditions for M. salmoides.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Britton, JR (Corresponding Author), Bournemouth Univ, Sch Conservat Sci, Ctr Conservat Ecol \& Environm Change, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England.

   2. Stable carbon isotopes were used in complementary laboratory and
   field studies to examine colonisation behaviour of an ephemeral
   agricultural habitat by the lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens
   Guerin-Meneville.
   3. Under laboratory conditions, H. convergens carbon isotope ratios,
   delta(13)C, changed after its food supply was shifted from a C-4- to a
   C-3-based diet of aphids produced on grain sorghum or cotton
   respectively. Final isotope ratios of adult H. convergens were closer to
   that of the new C-3-based diet, with most change in delta(13)C occurring
   within 3 days after the diet shift.
   4. The carbon isotope ratios of lady beetle adults collected in cotton
   fields suggested that grain sorghum was a continuous source for H.
   convergens until many nearby sorghum fields matured and senesced.
   5. When cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii Glover) prey were absent, carbon
   isotope ratios of beetle populations did not change over time and
   virtually no egg production by H. convergens was detected. This
   indicates that beetles were feeding little on non-aphid resources
   originating in cotton.
   6. With cotton aphids present, beetle isotope ratios decreased towards
   the carbon isotope ratio of cotton, indicating adult feeding in cotton.
   As a result, egg masses produced had carbon isotope ratios in the C-3

Article,Sylvain Doledec and Laurent Simon and Jeremie Blemus and Amandine Rigal and Joel Robin and Florian Mermillod-Blondin,"Multiple stressors shape invertebrate assemblages and reduce their
   trophic niche: A case study in a regulated stream",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,2021,773,NA,NA,JUN 15,"Few stud(C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.ies have addressed
   how the diversity of basal resources change with stream regulation and
   the potential consequences on river biota. We sampled invertebrates
   above and below a series of dams, over two years, at both downwelling
   and upwelling zones. In each zone, we recorded the daily temperature and
   flow variations, estimated the algal development, measured the available
   resources, and analysed carbon and nitrogen stable isotope compositions
   of the invertebrate community. The number of hydrological pulses were
   typically higher below the dams than above the dams especially during
   high-flow periods whereas the groundwater outlets had minor effects on
   invertebrate assemblages. Invertebrate abundance, richness and diversity
   tended to decrease below the dams. Co-inertia analysis showed that flow
   and temperature variations, and eutrophication explained most of the
   variance in the invertebrate assemblages, which comprised a higher
   number of resilient taxa below than above the dams. The proportions of
   pesticide-sensitive invertebrates were lower below the dams and
   ovoviviparous and more generalist taxa were prominent. We did not
   observe the expected CPOM decrease and FPOM increase downstream.
   Accordingly, the proportions of each functional feeding group were
   remarkably similar above and below the dams despite the long distance
   between the sectors (>100 kms). The diversity of basal resources used
   within assemblages progressively increased downstream above dams. In
   contrast, the diversity of resources used by organisms below the dams
   decreased from upstream to downstream suggesting a significant influence
   of flow regulation on aquatic food webs. Finally, the shorter trophic
   chains for the invertebrate assemblages below the dams suggests that the
   effects of stream regulation and eutrophication induced a simplification
   of food webs. To our knowledge, this study is the first to connect
   taxonomic and functional trait changes in response to multiple stressors
   with the associated modifications in isotopic niches within aquatic
   invertebrate assemblages.
   Context: Understanding how stream regulation and associated
   anthropogenic pressures act on aquatic assemblages and trophic niches is
   necessary to guide management actions.
   Goal: We aimed to investigate the functional responses (traits and
   trophic niches) of aquatic invertebrate assemblages to stream regulation
   and eutrophication.
   Methods: We used univariate and multivariate analyses to compare the
   invertebrate assemblages above and below the dams and to assess the
   contributions of hydrology (including groundwater supplies to the
   river), temperature and eutrophication to the variability in the
   composition of invertebrate assemblages. We also considered the relative
   utilization of a selected set of traits describing invertebrate
   resilience, resistance and specialization to address the potential
   functional effects of stream regulation on invertebrate assemblages.
   Finally, carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses allowed us to characterize
   the length and width of invertebrate assemblage food webs as related to
   the availability and diversity of basal resources.
   Results: Invertebrate abundance and richness generally decreased below
   the dams, with the highest impacts on insect taxa. Co-inertia analysis
   showed that stream regulation and eutrophication were main drivers of
   the aquatic invertebrate assemblages. The analysis separated the sites
   above and below the dams according to flow and temperature variation,
   whereas eutrophication appeared as a secondary stressor that separated
   the sites within each sector. Furthermore, the series of dams resulted
   in (i) a higher proportion of resilient (e.g., multivoltine) and
   resistant (ovoviviparous) taxa and a majority of generalists in
   assemblages below dams, (ii) an impact on the classical dynamics of CPOM
   (decrease) and FPOM (increase) sources from upstream to downstream, and
   (iii) a reduction in the diversity of resource use and in the trophic
   chain length of invertebrate assemblages below dams. The cooler and less
   oxygenated upwelling zones had lower invertebrate abundance; however,
   contrary to our expectation, the variation in the groundwater supply did
   not affect the composition of epigean invertebrate assemblages.
   Conclusion: This study provides insights about the impacts of flow
   regime alteration and eutrophication on food webs that may have been
   caused by regulation of permanent streams. To our knowledge, this is the
   first to connect taxonomic and functional trait changes in response to
   multiple stressors with the associated modifications in energy fluxes in
   aquatic invertebrate assemblages. This study suggests that bed
   stability, which is associated with a reduction in channel mobility
   below the dams and with moderate eutrophication, may provide the shelter
   and resources that can locally favour invertebrate assemblage dynamics
   and lessen the effects of flow regulation. In addition, the study
   suggests that the biological trait-based approach and isotope analysis
   are complementary approaches for addressing ecosystem functioning. The
   relative utilization of traits indicates the functional potential of
   aquatic invertebrate assemblages to face multiple stressors whereas
   isotope analysis is an expression of the actual effect of the stressors
   on the trophic structure of aquatic invertebrate assemblages.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Dolédec, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, CNRS, ENTPE,UMR 5023 LEHNA, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.

   ecological network analysis for quantitative measurement of food web
   dynamics",METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2011,2,1,56-65,JAN,"1. Quantitative food web analysis is made difficult by the need for
   simultaneous measurement of multiple carbon (C) flows. C flow rates can
   potentially be quantified indirectly using conventional methods such as
   gut contents analysis, but the involvement of many conversion factors
   and assumptions results in significant errors in the final estimation.
   Such difficulties have limited quantitative data on food web dynamics,
   restricting community-level hypothesis testing.
   2. We conducted laboratory microcosm and field experiments, using
   combined enriched stable isotope ((13)C), compartmental modelling and
   ecological network analysis (ENA) as a novel approach to quantifying
   food web dynamics. Feasibility of this approach was demonstrated via the
   quantification of C flow, backflow and cycling in a subtropical
   estuarine sandflat food web comprising three trophic levels:
   microphytobenthos (MPB), three dominant meiofaunal groups (juvenile
   polychaetes, harpacticoid copepods and nematodes) and soldier crabs
   (Mictyris longicarpus).
   3. Enriched sodiumbicarbonate (NaH(13)CO(3)) was used to trace C flow.
   The compartmental modelling software WINSAAM quantified C flow by
   comparing the temporal patterns of producer and consumer (13)C
   enrichment. Network analysis software ECONET was used to assess food web
   dynamics by providing system indices that quantified the flows and food
   web interactions.
   4. This approach allows concurrent quantitative assessment of food web
   structure and ecosystem functioning. WINSAAM results showed that C
   return rate from nematodes to MPB was greater than the other two
   meiofaunal groups and soldier crabs assimilated more C from nematodes
   than from the other two meiofaunal groups. System indices from ECONET
   suggested that indirect flow contributed more than direct flow in this
   system. Unique capabilities of this approach in food web studies and
   assumptions underlying the proposed and conventional food web analytical
   approaches are discussed.
   5. Another significant advance of this approach is that it allows
   sensitive quantification of trophic linkages in a food web without
   requiring equilibrium to be achieved, thus enabling instantaneous
   assessment of the relative importance of various C flow pathways.
   Specific hypotheses about food web dynamics, such as the impact of
   eutrophication and urbanization, can then be tested quantitatively
   through manipulative experiments by comparing indices reflecting system
   behaviour.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",Article,English,"Lee, KM (Corresponding Author), Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Gold Coast Campus, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia.

   CARBON PROCESSING IN THREE AUSTRALIAN RIVERS",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,2010,26,9,1129-1152,NOV,"Understanding longitudinal trends in the processing of carbon in rivers
   represents a much conceptualised, but infrequently tested, issue in
   aquatic ecology. In this study, we conducted concurrent longitudinal
   examinations of three very different rivers in eastern Australia to
   determine whether general principles in river functioning exist across
   broad geographic and hydrologic scales. Specifically, we examined trends
   in ambient basic water chemistry, nutrient concentrations, dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC), extracellular enzymes and food web structure and
   functioning and conducted bioassays to examine the degree to which DOC
   and nutrients limit heterotrophic bacterial respiration. These
   parameters revealed striking similarities across all sites. For metazoan
   communities, stable isotope analysis showed that algal carbon was the
   dominant basal resource utilised by consumers in all three rivers,
   suggesting that in-stream primary producers strongly underpin trophic
   pathways regardless of the position within a catchment or catchment
   condition. Analyses of extracellular enzymes revealed that microbial
   communities are actively utilising DOC at all sites. In fact,
   heterotrophic microbial respiration was strongly limited by DOC at all
   sites, with nutrient additions resulting in only relatively minor
   increases in respiration. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that DOC
   and algal carbon are critically important drivers of ecosystem processes
   in Australian riverine ecosystems. Furthermore, across all of our sites
   and rivers, ambient nutrient concentrations did not influence carbon
   processing. The consistent longitudinal trends in river function
   identified in this study provide useful insights for catchment managers
   and modellers with respect to identifiying key principles that underpin
   ecosystem functioning in Australian rivers. Copyright (C) 2009 John

   wetlands",FRESHWATER SCIENCE,2017,36,1,138-150,MAR,"Constructed stormwater wetlands are one strategy for mitigating the
   negative effects of urbanization on aquatic ecosystems. However, the
   biotic community in these wetlands generally is dominated by organisms
   able to tolerate poor water quality. Reduced macroinvertebrate diversity
   and abundance in comparison to natural wetlands, and prevalence of
   invasive species, such as Gambusia, can influence the flow of energy
   through food webs. We used stable -isotope analysis (813C and 8'5N) of
   food webs to assess whether the amount of catchment urbanization (total
   imperviousness {[}imperviousness] = \% catchment covered in impervious
   surfaces) influenced basal resources and trophic relationships in
   constructed wetlands in Melbourne, Australia. As imperviousness
   increased, the abundance and diversity of macroinvertebrates decreased
   significantly and the values of 813C and 815N recorded for fishes and
   macroinvertebrates increased significantly. An increase in
   imperviousness was associated with a decrease in the mean trophic
   position of fishes and an increase in the mean trophic position of
   macroinvertebrates. Our results suggest that sources of C differed
   between sites of low and high imperviousness and that N sources
   increased with increasing imperviousness. Our study provides an

   examined the effects of ocean acidification and warming on trophic
   interactions within a maerl bed community by using stable carbon and
   nitrogen isotope analysis. Two three-month experiments were conducted in
   winter and summer seasons with four different combinations of
   pCO(2)(ambient and elevated pCO(2)) and temperature (ambient and +3
   degrees C). Experimental assemblages were created in tanks held in the
   laboratory and were composed of calcareous (Lithothamnion corallioides)
   and fleshy algae (Rhodymenia ardissonei,Solieria chordalis,andUlvasp.),
   gastropods (Gibbula magusandJujubinus exasperatus), and sea urchins
   (Psammechinus miliaris). Our results showed higher seaweed availability
   for grazers in summer than winter. Therefore, grazers were able to adapt
   their diet seasonally. Increased pCO(2)and temperature did not modify
   the trophic structure in winter, while shifts in the contribution of
   seaweed were found in summer. Combined acidification and warming
   increased the contribution of biofilm in gastropods diet in summer
   conditions.Psammechinus miliarismostly consumedL. corallioidesunder
   ambient conditions, while the algaS. chordalisbecame the dominant food
   source under high pCO(2)in summer. Predicted changes in pCO(2)and
   temperature had complex effects on assemblage trophic structure. Direct
   effects of acidification and warming on seaweed metabolism may modify
   their abundance and biomass, affecting their availability for grazers.
   Climate change may also modify seaweeds' nutritive value and their
   palatability for grazers. The grazers we investigated were able to
   change their diet in response to changes in algal assemblages, an
   advantage given that warming and acidification alter the composition of

   freshwater species worldwide. The few remaining populations suffer from
   low recruitment rates and are subject to habitat fragmentation,
   pollution, siltation, decline or loss of host fish populations, and
   climate change. Successful conservation strategies for FPM require a
   holistic understanding of its ecological requirements, life history,
   population dynamics, and habitat prerequisites. Although habitat
   requirements are well described, food requirements at different life
   stages have received less attention. Stable isotope analyses of FPM and
   potential food resources in three German streams were combined with
   mixing model analysis to quantify organic matter resources assimilated
   by juvenile (first year after encystment from host fish) and semi-adult
   (10 years old, immature) individuals. There were only slight differences
   in dietary contributions between the two life stages, and terrestrial
   particulate organic matter and benthic organic matter contributed
   substantially to the diet. Tissue type was more important in explaining
   variation in dietary contributions than individual variation for
   semi-adult FPM. The strong reliance on terrestrial resources sheds new
   light on the functional role of unionid mussels and the connection of
   streams to their riparian area. The dependence of FPM on terrestrial
   resources also emphasizes the need for a stronger focus on the
   restoration and protection of intact riparian areas, including wetlands
   with their specific vegetation, when planning conservation and

   in invaded rivers: a case study in the Elbe and Rhine",AQUATIC INVASIONS,2015,10,4,385-397,OCT,"The invasive amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus has become increasingly
   dominant in German river ecosystems since the River Rhine invasion in
   the mid-1990s. Because it is preying on other invertebrate taxa, its
   appearance is often assumed to be associated with a drastic decrease in
   species diversity and changes in natural benthic communities. Despite
   this, the trophic function of D. villosus and its predation potential
   are rarely studied in natural river communities. Here, we assess the
   trophic function of D. villosus in two invaded systems, the Elbe River
   and the River Rhine, using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses.
   In the two studied river food webs, D. villosus had a generally low
   trophic position (TP), indicating a likely function as primary consumer
   or at most as an omnivore. The significantly higher TP in the River
   Rhine (TP = 2.6) than in the Elbe River (TP = 1.9) suggested a partial
   use of animal prey in the River Rhine. This was supported by the results
   of the isotope mixing model SIAR which predicted in addition to a high
   importance of herbivory in both rivers a likely feeding on other
   invasive amphipod species in the Rhine community. We conclude that D.
   villosus has a variable but mostly low predacious behaviour, probably
   depending on the benthic community structure. To allow more realistic
   trophic analyses for D. villosus in the field, we determined the trophic
   enrichment factors (TEFs) for nitrogen and carbon isotopes of two diet
   types in the tissue of D. villosus in an eight-week laboratory
   experiment. The carbon isotope enrichment (Delta delta C-13) from the
   chironomid diet was negative in the consumer (-1.75 \%), whereas the
   carbon from leaf litter was enriched positively in the tissue (3.27 \%).
   The TEFs for nitrogen (Delta delta N-15) were more similar for plant and
   animal diet (leaf litter: 3.56 \%, chironomids: 2.29 \%). Because of the
   high specificity of the enrichment factors with respect to species and
   food source, we recommend their use in further trophic analyses.",REGIONAL EURO-ASIAN BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS CENTRE-REABIC,"PL 3, HELSINKI, 00981, FINLAND",Article,English,"Hellmann, C (Corresponding Author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Integrated Nat Sci, Univ Str 1, D-56070 Koblenz, Germany.

   in two filter-feeding aquatic consumers",AQUATIC SCIENCES,2017,79,4,855-865,OCT,"Inferences about ecological structure and function are often made using
   elemental or macromolecular tracers of food web structure. For example,
   inferences about food chain length are often made using stable isotope
   ratios of top predators and consumer food sources are often inferred
   from both stable isotopes and fatty acid (FA) content in consumer
   tissues. The use of FAs as tracers implies some degree of macromolecular
   conservation across trophic interactions, but many FAs are subject to
   physiological alteration and animals may produce those FAs from
   precursors in response to food deficiencies. We measured 41 individual
   FAs and several aggregate FA metrics in two filter-feeding taxa to (1)
   assess ecological variation in food availability and (2) identify
   potential drivers of among-site variation in FA content. These taxa were
   filter feeding caddisflies (Family Hydropyschidae) and dreissenid
   mussels (Genus Dreissena), which both consume seston. Stable isotopic
   composition (C and N) in these taxa co-varied across 13 sites in the
   Great Lakes region of North America, indicating they fed on very similar
   food resources. However, co-variation in FA content was very limited,
   with only one common FA co-varying across this gradient (alpha-linolenic
   acid; ALA), suggesting these taxa accumulate FAs very differently even
   when exposed to the same foods. Based on these results, among-site
   variation in ALA content in both consumers does appear to be driven by

   different N-15 compositions influenced the food webs of downstream fish
   assemblages. In addition, we aimed to evaluate if estimates of fish
   trophic position (TP) are influenced by N-15-depleted and N-15-enriched
   baselines. We compared the food web of a fish assemblage upstream from
   tributaries (control site), with food webs downstream from N-15-depleted
   (site 1) and N-15-enriched tributaries (site 2). Fishes and resources
   collected from sites 1 and 2 had significant differences in N-15
   composition ((15) N-depleted and N-15-enriched, respectively) relative
   to their conspecifics from the control site. At the control site, fish
   species' TPs were more reliable and realistic based on their known
   feeding ecology, with TPs ranging between 2 and 3. In contrast, fish TPs
   at sites 1 and 2 ranged between 2 and 6, and no consistency was observed
   among trophic guilds. We conclude that tributaries exert a great
   influence on fish food webs at downstream sites, either by direct
   assimilation of organic matter by consumers, or by assimilation of the
   dissolved inorganic nitrogen by primary producers. In addition, fishes
   under influence of pollution may exhibit an inaccurate representation of

   Asian golden mussel <i>Limnoperna fortunei</i> in a subtropical river",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2020,57,4,717-728,APR,"The invasive Asian golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei is continuously
   expanding through South America, altering aquatic ecosystem structure
   and functioning. While several native fish species predate on this
   mussel, these interactions, and their consequences for the food web,
   have not been studied in depth.
   We combine a survey of the fish assemblage trophic structure using gut
   contents and stable isotope analysis with an in situ exclusion
   experiment in order to: (a) determine the main fish species predating on
   L. fortunei; (b) estimate the contribution of L. fortunei to the biomass
   of fish assemblage; and (c) evaluate the role of fish on the density and
   maximum shell length of L. fortunei in the lower Uruguay River (the Rio
   de La Plata Basin).
   We found that about one third of fish species in the assemblage (28 out
   of 81 species) consumed L. fortunei, which was an important food item
   (>10\% of the dietary volume and >30\% of frequency of occurrence) for
   11 fish species. Stable isotope mixing models consistently suggested
   that >14\% of the total biomass of the fish assemblage was derived
   directly from carbon derived from L. fortunei tissues. In addition, the
   exclusion experiment demonstrated that fish predation reduces the mussel
   density by c. 70\% and the mussel maximum shell length by c. 40\%.
   Synthesis and applications. Our research suggests a top-down effect of
   fish on the invasive Asian golden mussel's abundance. This work
   highlights the need to preserve the native fish communities,
   particularly in South America, where many vulnerable migratory fish are
   of key relevance as Limnoperna fortunei consumers. In the light of these
   findings, actions such as implementing efficient fish passage
   technologies in the actual (and projected) dams of the Uruguay River

   because of the rates at which they spread and their alterations to
   ecosystems. Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are of concern in many
   regions owing to expenses related to industrial equipment damage and
   control education efforts. However, their greatest cost may be their
   ecological impact across North America. We tested pumpkinseed (Lepomis
   gibbosus) from three populations in Ontario (Canada) to determine if
   there was variation across populations or sampling periods in the
   consumption of zebra mussels. Using a combination of stomach content and
   stable isotope analyses, we found that pumpkinseed diet consisted of
   primarily zebra mussels across all populations and sampling periods,
   including a minimum of 54\% in all lakes and sampling periods based on
   stable isotope mixing models. The current resource use patterns of
   pumpkinseed in our study populations indicate that there has been a
   shift from their pre-invasion diet of benthic littoral invertebrates
   such as gastropods. The large-scale consumption of invasive mussels by
   native fishes may have important implications for natural biological

   there is a global movement to incorporate ecosystem-based processes.
   Marine protected areas (MPAs) offer an important management tool for
   enhancing ecosystem structure and function. This study investigated
   whether a non-lethal indicator of trophic position (TP) could be used to
   evaluate fishery health in southern California MPAs. We hypothesized
   that a common predator, kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus), would occupy
   a higher TP and smaller niche space inside MPAs than at fished reference
   sites, and that these patterns would be supported by trends in abundance
   and gut contents. Stable isotope analysis of nitrogen (delta N-15) and
   carbon (delta C-13) were used to estimate the TP and niche space of kelp
   bass (N = 125) collected inside and outside of four MPAs during summer
   2016-2017. Although all MPA sites supported a significantly higher
   biomass of kelp bass than reference sites, there was no consistent
   pattern in TP and niche space inside versus outside of MPAs. Gut
   contents showed that exploitation of ephemeral pelagic foods may reduce
   localized effects of MPAs on prey availability for this species. Our
   findings suggest that MPAs will not have consistent impacts on food web
   dynamics for higher level generalist predators and that ecosystem-level
   responses to protection may vary across locations within a bioregion.

   the trophic structure of soil- and ground-based food webs",AQUATIC SCIENCES,2023,85,2,NA,APR,"The microbial control agent Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis
   (Bti) has been successfully used worldwide to reduce abundances of
   biting Nematocera (Diptera), often with little direct impact on
   non-target organisms observed. However, the potential for additional
   indirect effects on other ecosystem properties, including on trophic
   linkages within food webs, is poorly known. We investigated the effects
   of multiple-year mosquito control treatments using the Bti product
   VectoBac((R))-G on the stable isotope composition of epigeal and
   soil-based consumers inhabiting replicate floodplains along the River
   Dalalven, Sweden. We observed significant changes in the isotopic
   composition of detritivores feeding at the base of floodplain food webs.
   Enchytraeid worms were characterised by 3.5\% higher delta C-13 values
   in treated floodplains, suggesting increased consumption of delta
   C-13-enriched food. The overall range of community-wide delta N-15
   values was 56\% greater in the treated floodplains, whilst delta N-15
   values of oribatid mites were elevated by 97\%. These results suggest
   extra fractionation in the transfer of nitrogen through floodplain food
   chains. We conjecture that the ecological mechanisms driving these food
   web shifts are (1) the mass mortality of high delta C-13 A. sticticus
   larvae, which leaves high concentrations of dead mosquito biomass
   deposited on soils at local scales, after the floodwaters have receded
   and (2) incorporation of the very high delta C-13-enriched corn
   particles comprising the bulk of the VectoBac((R))-G product into
   floodplain food webs. Our results suggest that repeated applications of

   hunter-gatherers in the Baikal region of Siberia are examined based on
   carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures obtained from 350 human
   and 203 faunal bone samples. The human materials represent Early
   Neolithic (8000-6800 cal BP), Late Neolithic (6000-5000 cal BP), and
   Early Bronze Age periods (similar to 5000-4000 cal BP) and come from the
   following four smaller areas of the broader region: the Angara and upper
   Lena valleys, Little Sea of Baikal's northwest coast, and southwest
   Baikal. Forager diets from each area occupy their own distinct position
   within the stable isotope spectrum. This suggests that foraging ranges
   were not as large as expected given the distances involved and the lack
   of geographic obstacles between the micro-regions. All examined
   individuals followed a similar subsistence strategy: harvesting game and
   local fishes, and on Lake Baikal also the seal, and to a more limited
   extent, plant foods. Although well established in their home areas,
   exchange networks with the other micro-regions appear asymmetrical both
   in time and direction: more travel and contacts between some
   micro-regions and less between others. The Angara valley seems to be the
   only area with the possibility of a temporal change in the foraging
   strategy from more fishing during the Early Neolithic to more ungulate
   hunting during the Late Neolithic-Early Bronze Age. However, the shift
   in stable isotope values suggesting this change can be viewed also as
   evidence of climate change affecting primary productivity of the
   Baikal-Angara freshwater system. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by

   diets dominated by millet. Compared to other sites in Gansu Province,
   the humans and omnivores in this study were more reliant upon

   community was investigated at three reaches in the Kansas River, USA to
   determine if delta C-13 variability and delta N-15 values differ
   longitudinally and are related to urbanization and instream habitat.
   Fish and macroinvertebrates were collected at three river reaches in the
   Kansas River classified as the less urbanized reach (no urban in
   riparian zone; 40\% grass islands and sand bars, braided channel),
   intermediate (14\% riparian zone as urban; 22\% grass islands and sand
   bars) and urbanized (59\% of riparian zone as urban; 6\% grass islands
   and sand bars, highly channelized) reaches in June 2006. The less
   urbanized reach had higher variability in delta C-13 than the
   intermediate and urbanized reaches, suggesting fish from these reaches
   utilized a variety of carbon sources. The delta N-15 also indicated that
   omnivorous and detritivorous fish species tended to consume prey at
   higher trophic levels in the less urbanized reach. Channelization and
   reduction of habitat related to urbanization may be linked to

   past and, despite partial recovery, it is still considered endangered.
   Recent research has questioned its currently accepted subpopulation
   structure and migratory movements, challenging management and
   conservation efforts. Here we contribute to this discussion by
   presenting results of stable isotope analysis of fin whale bones and
   krill samples collected from fin whale stomachs from two exploited
   areas, west Iceland and northwest Spain, and comparing these results
   with North Atlantic isoscapes. In krill, N-15 values were highly
   variable and no significant differences in N-15 and C-13 between areas
   emerged. N-15 and C-13 values in bone were higher than in krill, due to
   trophic enrichment, and were not significantly different between areas.
   Both krill and bone results were slightly inconsistent with the local
   isoscapes, maybe due to seasonal variations in local productivity and in
   krill diet and, in the case of bone, to its capability to integrate
   long-term isotopic values, derived from food consumed in distant areas.
   Conversely, O-18 values, which reflect the basal signal of sea water,
   were consistent with isoscapes and significantly higher in whales from

   lotic ecosystems through increased habitat homogenization and decreased
   resource diversity. We conducted a field experiment and manipulated
   structural complexity and basal resource diversity to determine their
   effect on multiple aspects of community and food-web structure of
   degraded tropical streams. In-stream manipulations included the addition
   of woody debris (WD) and the addition of wood and leaf packs (WLP). The
   addition of structural complexity to degraded streams promoted detritus
   retention and had a positive effect on stream taxonomic richness,
   abundance and biomass. At the conclusion of the experiment, abundance
   and richness in the WD-treated reaches increased by over 110\% and 80\%,
   respectively, while abundance and richness in the WLP-treated reaches
   increased by over 280\% and 170\% respectively. Wood debris and leaves
   were consumed only by few taxa. Detritivorous taxa were the most
   abundant trophic guild at the beginning and at the end of the
   experiment. Food webs in treated reaches were relatively more complex in
   terms of links and species at the conclusion of the experiment, with
   highest maximum food chain length in the WD treatments and highest
   number of trophic species, links, link density, predators and prey at
   the WLP treatment. Despite differences observed in diet-based food webs,
   there was little variation in isotopic niche space, likely due to the
   high degree of omnivory and trophic redundancy, which was attributed to
   the importance of fine detritus that supported a broad range of
   consumers. Even in these degraded streams, aquatic taxa responded to the
   addition of increased complexity suggesting that these efforts may be an
   effective first step to restoring the structure and function of these

   Our main objective was to identify large-scale patterns in the

   (WW) structure, proposed for the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean. We
   evaluated 3 sub-Antarctic marine areas in a regional context: the Beagle

   oceanic Burdwood Bank area (BB). We used carbon and nitrogen isotopic
   information of all functional trophic groups, ranging from primary
   producers to top predators, and analyzed them through stable
   isotope-based Bayesian analyses. We found that BC and BB have a more
   pronounced WW structure compared to CA. We identified species at mid to
   low trophic positions that play a key role in the trophodynamics of each
   marine area (e.g. Fuegian sprat Sprattus fuegensis, longtail southern
   cod Patagonotothen ramsayi and squat lobster Munida gregaria) and
   considered them as the most plausible WW species. The identification of

Article,Ligang Zhou and Sandra J. Garvie-Lok,"Isotopic evidence for the expansion of wheat consumption in northern
   China",ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN ASIA,2015,4,NA,25-35,DEC,"Flotation and carbon dating indicate that wheat was introduced into
   northern China, where millet agriculture had existed for thousands of
   years, around 3000-2000 BC. Wheat eventually replaced millet as the
   staple of northern Chinese diets, but it is still unclear how it was
   added to the established agricultural system and when millet finally
   lost its staple role to the imported crop. Because wheat and millet have
   distinct delta C-13 values, stable isotope analysis offers an
   opportunity to answer these questions. Here, we review published stable
   isotope data for 645 human samples from 36 sites in northern China,
   dating from 3000 to 2000 BC to the sixth century AD, summarizing the
   current evidence for dietary changes since the appearance of wheat. The
   results indicate that wheat had little influence on human nutrition at
   its first appearance. The first possible evidence for wheat consumption
   is seen in Xinjiang about 1800 BC. Further east in Qinghai and Gansu, a
   shift from C4-based diets to mixed C4/C3-based diets occurred between
   2000 and 1500 BC. In areas further east, millet continues to dominate
   human diets for the following two millennia, although wheat has been
   widely recovered in archeological contexts and its importance in
   agriculture was recorded in contemporary documents. Itwas only in the
   sixth century AD that C3 crops became important in human diets in the
   east of northern China. This is quite different fromthe scenario
   depicted by palaeobotanical studies, and illustrates the need for

   understanding of migratory connectivity, food web dynamics and ecosystem
   structure. In marine systems, although large animals that return to land
   can be fitted with tracking devices, minimum instrument sizes preclude
   deployments on small seabirds that may nevertheless be highly abundant
   and hence major consumers. An increasingly popular approach is to use N
   and C stable isotope analysis of feathers sampled at colonies to provide
   information on distribution and trophic level for the preceding, and
   generally little-known, nonbreeding period. Despite the burgeoning of
   this research, there have been few attempts to verify such
   relationships. In this study, we demonstrate a clear correspondence
   between isotope ratios of feathers and nonbreeding distributions of
   seven species from South Georgia tracked using loggers. This generated a
   rudimentary isoscape that was used to infer the habitat preferences of
   eight other species ranging in size from storm petrels to albatrosses,
   and which could be applied, with caveats, in other studies. Differences
   in inferred distribution within and between species had major
   implications for relative exposure to anthropogenic threats, including
   climate change and fisheries. Although there were no differences in
   isotope values between sexes in any of the smaller petrels, mean stable
   C (delta C-13), but not stable N isotope ratios (delta N-15), tended to
   be greater in females than males of the larger, and more sexually
   size-dimorphic species. This indicates a difference in C source
   (distribution), rather than trophic level, and a correspondence between
   the degree of sexual size dimorphism in Procellariiformes and the level
   of between-sex niche segregation.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Article,English,"Phillips, RA (Corresponding Author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.

   dramatic regime shift driven by water level changes",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,2021,756,NA,NA,FEB 20,"Across the globe, lake ecosystems are exposed to a variety of human
   disturbances. A notable example is shallow lakes where human-induced
   eutrophication or water level fluctuation may result in a switch from a
   clear-water, macrophyte-dominated state to a turbid,
   phytoplankton-dominated state. Yet, few investigations have described
   synchronous changes in biotic assemblage composition and food web
   framework under such a shift between alternative states. We used stable
   carbon and nitrogen isotopes to test the extent to which switching from
   macrophyte to phytoplankton dominance in Lake Gucheng, triggered by a
   water level increase, would alter ecosystem structure and change the
   basal resources supporting the food web. We found that invertebrates and
   fish compensated for a reduction of macrophyte and epiphyte resources by
   deriving more energy from the alternative pelagic energy channel, where
   benthic invertebrates act as crucial links between primary producers and
   higher consumers by transporting delta C-13 depleted pelagic algae to
   the benthic zone. Although consumers can respond to large shifts in
   energy allocation and stabilize food web dynamics through their ability
   to feed across multiple energy pathways, our study suggest that energy
   subsidies may promote trophic cascades and enhance the stability of the
   turbid regime. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Gu, XH (Corresponding Author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog \& Limnol, East Beijing Rd 73, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

   MELANOSTOMUS</i> (ACTINOPTERYGII: PERCIFORMES: GOBIIDAE), AND ITS
   TROPHIC ROLE IN THE CURONIAN LAGOON, SE BALTIC SEA",ACTA ICHTHYOLOGICA ET PISCATORIA,2013,43,2,95-108,NA,"Background. The round goby, Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814), is a
   recent invader in the Curonian Lagoon, SE Baltic Sea. As invasive
   species are among the most severe threats for biodiversity loss and can
   induce food web alterations, the development of round goby population in
   the Curonian Lagoon and its possible impacts on fish community and the
   entire ecosystem are of great scientific interest. This research reports
   on the expansion and trophic role of round goby in the Curonian Lagoon.
   Materials and methods. Occurrence and abundance of round goby was
   investigated using a beach seine and gill nets at the northern and
   central parts of the Curonian Lagoon during a six-year period from 2007
   to 2012. The trophic niche of the newcomer was revealed by applying gut
   content and stable isotope analyses (SIA). A total of 61 samples of
   other fish species were taken for SIA in order to reveal with which
   resident fish species the exploitative competition could be expected.
   Stable isotope mixing models were used to evaluate the contribution of
   round goby to the nutrition of top predators of the Curonian Lagoon:
   European perch, Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758; pike-perch, Sander
   lucioperca (Linnaeus, 1758); great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo; and
   grey heron, Ardea cinerea.
   Results. The survey showed that round goby expanded its distribution
   area and recently occurs in the entire Lithuanian part of the Curonian
   Lagoon. Variation in the density of round goby suggests that the
   invader's abundance may be stabilised in the northern part of the
   lagoon. Gut content and stable isotope analyses showed round goby being
   mainly benthivorous. The largest trophic overlap with respect to SIA was
   detected between the invader and ruffe, Gymnocephalus cernua (Linnaeus,
   1758), the fish which presumably exploits the same habitat type.
   According to stable isotope mixing models round goby was included with
   considerable shares into the diet of top predators.
   Conclusion. The further expansion of round goby inside the Curonian
   Lagoon is ongoing. However, there is evidence on population density
   stabilisation in the northern part of the lagoon. Native benthivorous
   fish, especially ruffe, may be affected through competition for food
   resources in habitats where the newcomer is numerous. Round goby
   significantly contributes to the diet of piscivorous fish and birds.
   That may promote the regulation of invader population abundance in the

   affecting the composition and functioning of soil communities. Effects
   of plants on soil communities are largely taxon-dependent, but how
   different functional groups of herbaceous plants affect trophic niches
   of individual animal species in soil needs further investigation. Here,
   we studied the use of basal resources and trophic levels of dominating
   soil meso- and macrofauna using stable isotope ratios of carbon and
   nitrogen in arable fallow systems 3 and 14-16 years after abandonment.
   Animals were sampled from the rhizosphere of three plant species of
   different functional groups: a legume (Medicaco sativa), a nonlegume
   herb (Taraxacum officinale), and a grass (Bromus sterilis). We found
   virtually no consistent effects of plant identity on stable isotope
   composition of soil animals and on thirteen isotopic metrics that
   reflect general food-web structure. However, in old fallows, the carbon
   isotope composition of some predatory macrofauna taxa had shifted closer
   to that of co-occurring plants, which was particularly evident
   forLasius, an aphid-associated ant genus. Trophic levels and
   trophic-chain lengths in food webs were similar across plant species and
   fallow ages. Overall, the results suggest that variations in local plant
   diversity of grassland communities may little affect the basal resources
   and the trophic level of prey consumed by individual species of meso-
   and macrofauna belowground. By contrast, successional changes in
   grassland communities are associated with shifts in the trophic niches
   of certain species, reflecting establishment of trophic interactions

   sub-Antarctic predator, the rockhopper penguin <i>Eudyptes
   chrysocome</i>",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,2006,12,4,611-625,APR,"The rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) is a conspicuous apex
   marine predator that has experienced marked population declines
   throughout most of its circumpolar breeding distribution. The cause(s)
   for the declines remain elusive, but the relatively large
   spatio-temporal scale over which population decreases have occurred
   implies that ecosystem-scale, at-sea factors are likely to be involved.
   We employ stable isotope analyses of carbon (C-13/C-12, expressed as
   delta C-13) and nitrogen (N-15/N-14, delta N-15) in time-series of
   rockhopper penguin feather samples, dating back to 1861, in order to
   reconstruct the species' ecological history. Specifically, we examine
   whether rockhopper penguin population decline has been associated with a
   shift towards lower primary productivity in the ecosystem in which they
   feed, or with a shift to a diet of lower trophic status and lower
   quality, and we use long-term temperature records to evaluate whether
   shifts in isotope ratios are associated with annual variations in sea
   surface temperature. Having controlled temporally for the Suess Effect
   and for increases in CO2 concentrations in seawater, we found that
   overall, delta C-13 signatures decreased significantly over time in
   rockhopper penguins from seven breeding sites, supporting the hypothesis
   that decreases in primary productivity, and hence, carrying capacity,
   for which delta C-13 signature is a proxy, have been associated with the
   decline of penguin populations. There was some evidence of a long-term
   decline in delta N-15 at some sites, and strong evidence that delta N-15
   signatures were negatively related to sea surface temperatures across
   sites, indicative of a shift in diet to prey of lower trophic status
   over time and in warm years. However, a site-by-site analysis revealed
   divergent isotopic trends among sites: five of seven sites exhibited
   significant temporal or temperature-related trends in isotope
   signatures. This study highlights the utility of stable isotope analyses
   when applied over relatively long timescales to apex predators.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Hilton, GM (Corresponding Author), Royal Soc Protect Birds, Lodge, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, England.

   introduction of invasive quagga mussels (<i>Dreissena bugensis</i>) in
   Lake Mead, Nevada and Arizona, USA",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,2021,752,NA,NA,JAN 15,"Introductions of dreissenid mussels in North America have been a
   significant concern over the last few decades. This study assessed the
   distribution of synthetic organic compounds (SOCs) in the food web of
   Lake Mead, Nevada/Arizona, USA and how this distribution was influenced
   by the introduction of invasive quagga mussels. A clear spatial gradient
   of SOC concentrations in water was observed between lake basins
   downstream of populated areas andmore rural areas. Within the foodweb,
   trophic magnification factors (TMF) indicated statistically significant
   biomagnification for nine, and biodilution for two, of 22 SOCs examined.
   The highest value recorded was for PCB 118 (TMF, 5.14), and
   biomagnification of methyl triclosan (TMF, 3.85) was also apparent.
   Biodilution was observed for Tonalide (R) (0.06) and Galaxolide (R)
   (0.38). Total SOC concentration in quagga mussels was higher than in
   three pelagic fishes. Also, 19 of 20 SOC examined in Largemouth Bass
   (Micropterus salmoides) had substantially lower concentrations in 2013,
   when quagga mussels had become well established, than in 2007/08, soon
   after quagga mussels were introduced. Estimates of SOC concentrations in
   the water column and quagga mussels suggest that a considerable portion
   (similar to 10.5\%) of the SOC mass in the lake has shifted from the
   pelagic to the benthic environments due to quagga mussel growth. These
   observations suggest that benthic species, such as the endangered
   Razorback Sucker, may be experiencing increased risk of SOC exposure. In
   addition, stable isotope analysis (carbon and nitrogen) indicated a
   decrease in the nutritional value of zooplankton to consumers (e.g.,
   Razorback Sucker larvae) since quagga mussels became established. These
   changes could affect Razorback Sucker larval survival and recruitment.
   Results from this study strongly suggest that the introduction of quagga
   mussels has greatly altered the dynamics of SOCs and other processes in
   the food web of Lake Mead. Published by Elsevier B.V.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Patiño, R (Corresponding Author), Texas Tech Univ, Texas Cooperat Fish \& Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.

   continental shelf, subtropical Brazil",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,2014,512,NA,55-69,OCT 9,"This study was conducted on the continental shelf surrounding a large
   metropolitan region on the coast of Sao Paulo State, Southeast Brazil.
   This region harbours a large industrial plant and the largest port in
   Latin America, both of which release pollutants into the Santos-Sao
   Vicente estuarine system. High levels of Hg have been reported in
   sediments and fish from the estuaries and Santos Bay; however, data for
   the biota in offshore waters are scarce, and the biomagnification of Hg
   across the food web here has never been assessed. In this study, the
   trophic structure of the Santos shelf was addressed through the carbon
   and nitrogen stable isotope compositions of different species across a
   trophic gradient. We determined the total Hg levels (THg, dry weight) of
   invertebrates and fish to estimate the rate of biomagnification of this
   metal in the benthic and pelagic food webs. The lowest mean THg levels
   were found in zooplankton (0.006 mu g g(-1)) and surface-depositivore
   polychaetes (0.011 mu g g(-1)); the highest THg levels were found in the
   largest fishes: Patagonian flounder (0.825 mu g g(-1)), fat snook (0.714
   mu g g(-1)), and lesser guitarfish (0.639 mu g g(-1)). Overall, the Hg
   concentration in fish was below the recommended limit for human
   consumption. The THg and delta N-15 were positively correlated in both
   food webs; however, the rate of biomagnification was higher and the
   basal Hg was lower in the pelagic food web. These differences may be
   related to the differing bioavailability of mercury in water and
   sediment, the higher diversity of prey and more complex feeding
   interactions in the benthic food web, and metabolic differences among
   different taxa.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",Article,English,"Muto, EY (Corresponding Author), Fundactr, Rua Capote Valente 710, BR-05409002 Sao Paulo, Brazil.

   sources linked to forest management intensity",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,2019,29,4,NA,JUN,"Our understanding of how forest management practices affect the relative
   importance of autochthonous vs. allochthonous resource use by headwater
   stream food webs is relatively poor. To address this, we used stable
   isotope (C, N, and H) analyses of food sources and macroinvertebrates
   from 15 streams in New Brunswick (Canada) and assessed how different
   catchment conditions arising from the gradient in forest management
   intensity affect the contribution of autochthonous resources to these
   food webs. Aquatic primary production contributed substantially to the
   biomass of invertebrates in these headwater streams, especially for
   scrapers and collector-gatherers (25-75\%). However, the contribution of
   algae to food webs decreased as forest management intensity (road
   density and associated sediments, water cations/carbon, and dissolved
   organic matter humification) increased, and as canopy openness
   decreased. This trend was probably due to an increase in the delivery of
   organic and inorganic terrestrial materials (dissolved and in
   suspension) in areas of greater harvesting intensity and road density,
   which resulted in more heterotrophic biofilms. Overall, results suggest
   that, despite the presence of riparian buffers, forest management can
   affect stream food web structure via changes in energy flows, and that
   increased protection should be directed at minimizing ground disturbance
   in areas with direct hydrological connection to streams and at reducing
   dissolved and particulate matter inputs from roads and stream crossings

   identify past El Nino events, must be based on more than a single coral

   to reconstruct the trophic hierarchy of 31 groups, from primary
   producers to polar bears, in the Canadian Beaufort Sea continental
   shelf. Trophic level (TL) estimates from EwE were compared with those
   derived from two nitrogen stable isotope (SI) modelling approaches (SI
   linear and scaled) to assess EwE accuracy, using a data set of 642 delta
   N-15 observations across 282 taxa. TLs from EwE were strongly,
   positively related to those from both SI models (R-2 > 0.80). EwE
   performed well (within 0.2 TL) for groups with relatively well-known
   diets or for taxa characterized by fewer trophic connections (e.g.,
   primary consumers). Performance was worse (>0.5 TL) for species groups
   aggregated at coarse taxonomic levels, those with poorly documented

   is critical for understanding the causes and consequences of diversity.
   Food-chain length (FCL) is a product of the biotic interactions within a
   community and the environment, but how environmental variation affects
   FCL is not well understood. We examined how gradients of ecosystem size
   and environmental variation in hydroperiod affected the FCL of ponds.
   Using C and N stable isotopes, we found that average FCL was 3.3 and
   varied by 3 trophic levels across ponds and years. We showed that ponds
   with shorter hydroperiods have shorter food chains, and that FCL is not
   strongly influenced by ecosystem size. These results demonstrate support
   for the dynamic constraints hypothesis, which states that
   less-predictable environments should have shorter food chains. Our data
   are not consistent with the prediction of the ecosystem size hypothesis
   that larger ecosystems have longer food chains. Insect and amphibian
   richness increased with increasing pond size and hydroperiod, results
   indicating that insertion of new species into the pond communities is a
   driving mechanism causing variation in FCL. Omnivory could explain
   variation in FCL, but our results show that the incidence of omnivory
   was similar across the environmental gradients. Ours is one of the few
   empirical studies to link structural changes in the food web with
   variability in FCL. We showed that temporal variation and species

   open water seasons have resulted in changing Arctic ecosystem dynamics.
   Expected changes include shifts in distribution and abundance of prey
   species for seabirds and marine mammals. Using stable isotope analysis,
   we studied spatial and interannual variation in ringed seal (Pusa
   hispida) feeding ecology in Hudson Bay in relation to environmental
   variables, between 2003 and 2010. Ringed seal muscle and hair samples
   collected from Arviat and Sanikiluaq, Nunavut, were analyzed for stable
   isotope ratios of nitrogen (N-15) and carbon (C-13). Seals from western
   Hudson Bay (Arviat) had higher N-15 and lower C-13 than seals from
   eastern Hudson Bay (Sanikiluaq), and stable isotope ratios varied
   interannually within each region. Peak N-15 occurred in years with
   spring air temperatures between approximately -5 degrees C and -2
   degrees C. This temperature range was characteristic of warm years in
   western Hudson Bay and cool years in eastern Hudson Bay. We hypothesize
   that the high N-15 observed in ringed seals is indicative of greater
   importance of capelin (Mallotus villosus) in ringed seal diet. A

   Kuroshio-Oyashio transition zone of the Western North Pacific were
   investigated based on analyses of bulk stable isotopes (delta C-13,
   delta N-15) and amino acid nitrogen isotopes (delta N-15(AA)).
   Differences in delta C-13 and delta N-15 between Japanese sardine and
   mackerel were small for age-0, and inter-annual variation trends were
   similar, suggesting they depend on similar food sources in the same food
   web at this age. In contrast, inter-annual variation in delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 were significantly different between both species at age-1+,
   and both delta N-15 of phenylalanine (delta N-15(Phe): an indicator of
   nitrogen source) and trophic position estimated from delta N-15(AA)
   (TPAA) were higher in mackerel, suggesting that the two species depend
   on distinct food webs as they age. Inter-annual variations in delta
   N-15(Phe) were considered to have different causes for the two species;
   differences in food web structure due to the degree of southward
   intrusion of the Oyashio Current for Japanese sardine, compared to a
   shift in migration area and depth for mackerel. Furthermore, competition
   for food due to the recent increases in the population densities of both
   fishes appeared to be reflected in increased TPAA of mackerel. Although
   they are caught in the same region, the mechanism of variation in food
   sources differs because of differences in migration area, depth, and

   multidimensional niche metrics of a breeding Arctic marine bird",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,2021,796,NA,NA,NOV 20,"Human industrialization has resulted in rapid climate change, leading to
   wide-scale environmental shifts. These shifts can modify food web
   dynamics by altering the abundance and distribution of primary producers
   (ice algae and phytoplankton), as well as animals at higher trophic
   levels. Methylmercury (MeHg) is a neuro-endocrine disrupting compound
   which biomagnifies in animals as a function of prey choice, and as such
   bioavailability is affected by altered food web dynamics and adds an
   important risk-based dimension in studies of foraging ecology.
   Multidimensional niche dynamics (MDND; delta C-13, delta N-15, THg;
   total mercury) were determined among breeding common eider (Somateria
   mollissima) ducks sampled from 10 breeding colonies distributed across
   the circumpolar Arctic and subarctic. Results showed high variation in
   MDND among colonies as indicated by niche size and ranges in delta C-13,
   delta N-15 and THg values in relation to spatial differences in primary
   production inferred from sea-ice presence and colony migratory status.
   Colonies with higher sea-ice cover during the pre-incubation period had
   higher median colony THg, delta N-15, and delta C-13. Individuals at
   migratory colonies had relatively higher THg and delta N-15, and lower
   delta C-13, suggesting a higher trophic position and a greater reliance
   on phytoplankton-based prey. It was concluded that variation in MDND
   exists among eider colonies which influenced individual blood THg
   concentrations. Further exploration of spatial ecotoxicology and MDND at
   each individual site is important to examine the relationships between
   anthropogenic activities, foraging behaviour, and the related risks of
   contaminant exposure at even low, sub-lethal concentrations that may
   contribute to deleterious effects on population stability over time.
   Overall, multidimensional niche analysis that incorporates multiple
   isotopic and contaminant metrics could help identify those populations
   at risk to rapidly altered food web dynamics. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All

   the South Atlantic subtropical convergence",BIOGEOSCIENCES,2019,16,18,3621-3635,SEP 24,"The stable isotopic composition of particulate organic carbon (delta
   C-13(POC)) in the surface waters of the global ocean can vary with the
   aqueous CO2 concentration ({[}CO2(aq)]) and affects the trophic transfer
   of carbon isotopes in the marine food web. Other factors such as cell
   size, growth rate and carbon concentrating mechanisms decouple this
   observed correlation. Here, the variability in delta C-13(POC) is
   investigated in surface waters across the south subtropical convergence
   (SSTC) in the Atlantic Ocean, to determine carbon isotope fractionation
   (epsilon(p)) by phytoplankton and the contrasting mechanisms of carbon
   uptake in the subantarctic and subtropical water masses. Our results
   indicate that cell size is the primary determinant of delta C-13(POC)
   across the Atlantic SSTC in summer. Combining cell size estimates with
   CO2 concentrations, we can accurately estimate epsilon(p) within the
   varying surface water masses in this region. We further utilize these
   results to investigate future changes in epsilon(p) with increased
   anthropogenic carbon availability. Our results suggest that smaller
   cells, which are prevalent in the subtropical ocean, will respond less
   to increased {[}CO2(aq)] than the larger cells found south of the SSTC
   and in the wider Southern Ocean. In the subantarctic water masses,
   isotopic fractionation during carbon uptake will likely increase, both
   with increasing CO2 availability to the cell, but also if increased
   stratification leads to decreases in average community cell size.
   Coupled with decreasing delta C-13 of {[}CO2(aq)] due to anthropogenic
   CO2 emissions, this change in isotopic fractionation and lowering of
   delta C-13(POC) may propagate through the marine food web, with
   implications for the use of delta C-13(POC) as a tracer of dietary

   indigenous macroinvertebrate community and food web structure by
   changing the resource availability. One of these species is the invasive
   amphipodDikerogammarus villosus, whose impact by predation, especially
   on coexisting amphipods, is still under debate. In this study, we aim to
   apply compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino acid delta
   N-15, which is the state-of-the-art approach for marine systems to
   estimate trophic positions, (1) to calculate beta values (i.e., the
   differences in delta N-15 values of trophic and source amino acids in
   primary producer) for freshwater systems, based on field samples of
   freshwater primary consumers (i.e., mussels) from the River Rhine, and
   (2) use these beta values in a case study to calculate the trophic
   position of the invasiveD. villosusin comparison with coexisting
   indigenous and non-native amphipod species from the river Alb sampled in
   2013 and river Speyerbach sampled in 2014, two tributaries of the River
   Rhine, Central Europe. Our results show that our freshwater beta values
   calculated for six combinations of trophic and source amino acids were
   lower by between approximately 0.85 parts per thousand and 5.67 parts
   per thousand than those found for marine animals in previous studies.
   This highlights that more attention is needed on the variability of the
   natural differences in beta values between ecosystems. By using the
   freshwater beta values, we showed that the trophic position ofD.
   villosusis comparable to those of coexisting amphipod species. These
   findings confirm thatD. villosushas a flexible and omnivorous feeding
   strategy like other amphipod species, and suggest that predation is not

   niche utilization",ECOSPHERE,2019,10,4,NA,APR,"The rapid warming of the Arctic may not only alter species' abundances
   and distributions, but likely also the trophic interactions within and
   between ecosystems. On the high-arctic tundra, extreme warm spells and
   associated rain-on-snow events in winter can encapsulate the vegetation
   entirely in ground-ice (i.e., basal ice) and directly or indirectly
   affect plants, herbivores, and carnivores. However, the implications of
   such extreme events for trophic interactions and food-web ecology are
   generally far from understood. Here, we show that wild Svalbard reindeer
   populations increasingly isolated by lack of sea-ice respond to
   rain-on-snow and ice-locked pastures by increased kelp consumption.
   Based on annual population surveys in late winters 2006-2015, the
   proportion of individual reindeer feeding along the shoreline increased
   the icier the winter. Stable isotope values (delta S-34, delta C-13,
   delta N-15) of plants, washed-ashore kelp, and fresh reindeer feces
   collected along coast-inland gradients, confirmed ingestion of marine
   biomass by the reindeer in the shoreline habitat. Thus, even on remote
   islands and peninsulas increasingly isolated by sea-ice loss, effects of
   climate change may be buffered in part by behavioral plasticity and
   increased use of resource subsidies. This marine dimension of a
   terrestrial herbivore's realized foraging niche adds to evidence that

   D) in order to characterize its hydrochemical properties and the main
   processes controlling them. Results showed that the Uchhali complex
   salinity has dramatically increased compared to other similar lakes in
   the world. While the Uchhali (UL) and Khabbeki (KL) lakes present a
   sodium-chloride hydrofacies, the Jahlar (JL) is of a sodium-bicarbonate
   type. Hydrochemistry parameters indicate that the weathering of
   surrounding rocks is the major vector for the increase of total
   dissolved solids in the water. On the other hand, the observed
   enrichment in heavy isotopes of the water stable isotope compositions
   implies that the different lakes are undergoing a long history of
   intense evaporation. The study of the corresponding Cl-37 isotope
   compositions supports the conclusion that evaporation, along with
   weathering, are the main driving processes. Besides climate effects that
   result in the decrease of annual precipitation and the increase of
   evaporation, water consumption for domestic purposes (household and
   agriculture) aggravates the rise of the lakes' salinity.",MDPI,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Hussain, SA; Han, FQ; Han, JL (Corresponding Author), Chinese Acad Sci, Qinghai Inst Salt Lakes, Key Lab Comprehens \& Highly Efficient Utilizat Sa, Xining 810008, Qinghai, Peoples R China.

   Oland, Sweden, from the Mesolithic to the Roman Period",JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY,2008,27,4,520-543,DEC,"The Mesolithic-Neolithic transition in north-west Europe has been
   described as rapid and uniform, entailing a swift shift from the use of
   marine and other wild resources to domesticated terrestrial resources.
   Here, we approach the when, what and how of this transition on a
   regional level, using empirical data from Oland, an island in the Baltic
   Sea off the Swedish east coast, and also monitor changes that occurred
   after the shift. Radiocarbon dating and stable carbon and nitrogen
   isotope analyses of bones and teeth from 123 human individuals, along
   with faunal isotope data from 27 species, applying to nine sites on
   Oland and covering a time span from the Mesolithic to the Roman Period,
   demonstrate a great diversity in food practices, mainly governed by
   culture and independent of climatic changes. There was a marked dietary
   shift during the second half of the third millennium from a mixed marine
   diet to the use of exclusively terrestrial resources, interpreted as
   marking the large-scale introduction of farming. Contrary to previous
   claims, this took place at the end of the Neolithic and not at the
   onset. Our data also show that culturally induced dietary transitions
   occurred continuously throughout prehistory. The availability of
   high-resolution data on various levels, from intra-individual to
   inter-population, makes stable isotope analysis a powerful tool for
   studying the evolution of food practices. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All

   physiology of two invasive herbs",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2010,98,4,833-844,JUL,"P>1. Clonal plants benefit from the ability to translocate resources
   among interconnected ramets to colonize heterogeneous habitats. Clonal
   integration affects the resource level and morphological traits of
   ramets, and thus may influence their physiology and general performance.
   Although leaf gas exchange and its associated physiological adjustments
   are key traits to assess plant fitness, the effect of clonal integration
   on these functional traits is insufficiently understood.
   2. In a glasshouse experiment, we addressed how clonal integration
   affects gas exchange properties, leaf characters and growth of ramets in
   two invasive plants, Alternanthera philoxeroides and Phyla canescens,
   under full sun and 85\% shade. We also used stable-isotope labelling to
   assess the maternal subsidy to daughter ramets.
   3. Similar effects of connection were observed in both species for most
   gas exchange parameters and leaf characters. Clonal integration did not
   affect photosynthetic capacity and respiratory rates of ramets. When
   grown in shade, ramets connected with an unshaded mother plant displayed
   higher area-based leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll content than severed
   ramets, but the additional nitrogen and chlorophyll was not translated
   to increased photosynthetic capability. Overall, severed ramets
   displayed significant light response for leaf nitrogen (area-based),
   photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, chlorophyll to nitrogen ratio,
   and nitrogen stable-isotope signature, but the light response was
   eliminated by clonal integration in connected ramets.
   4. Both species displayed substantial maternal carbohydrate subsidy that
   benefited the growth of daughter ramets, but species-specific patterns
   were observed in the growth of daughter ramets and the amount of
   subsidy. The amount of subsidy was independent of ramet growth light
   levels for P. canescens, but shaded, connected ramets of A.
   philoxeroides received more subsidy than unshaded controls, facilitating
   a larger growth improvement relative to severed counterparts than P.
   canescens.
   5. Synthesis. We observed increased leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll in
   shaded, connected ramets of two clonal invasive plants. Clonal
   integration may facilitate nitrogen assimilation and allow
   pre-acclimation to high-light conditions for shaded, connected ramets,
   thus promoting the opportunistic expansion of these invaders on site
   scale. The species-specific maternal subsidy pattern demonstrated that
   clonal plants possess different strategies to subsidize ramets under
   light-limited conditions.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Xu, CY (Corresponding Author), CSIRO Entomol, 120 Meiers Rd, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia.

   habitats beyond the importance of hydroperiod and vertebrate predators,
   especially regarding trophic structure. We used playa wetlands,
   ephemeral habitats common in arid to semi-arid regions, as our study
   ecosystem. We predicted that larger, more species-rich playas would have
   food webs with larger dimensions (longer food chains and more energy
   sources used), more variation (more niches filled) and more redundancy
   (niche overlap). We used geometric properties of stable C and N isotope
   biplots to explore: (i) what regulates trophic structure in ephemeral
   wetlands, (ii) the role of anthropogenic forces in altering factors
   controlling trophic structure and (iii) how trophic structure in
   ephemeral systems differs from that typical of permanent systems. We
   sampled aquatic animal food webs of 21 playa wetlands located mostly in
   the short-grass prairies of the Pawnee National Grassland in Colorado,
   U.S.A. Playas with higher insect diversity had more complex trophic
   structures than those dominated by large branchiopods (tadpole, clam and
   fairy shrimps). Insect diversity seemed dependent on length of the
   hydroperiod and time since filling, both of which are determined by
   playa depth. The key to understanding trophic structure in playas is an
   interaction between hydroperiod and the traits, lifespans and trophic
   niches of the species present. The trophic structure of naturally
   created playas was marginally more complex than artificial playas, and
   playas buffered by native vegetation were more likely to have food webs
   that included unique trophic strategies. Food webs of playas influenced
   by row crop agriculture had a broader selection of food sources. Playas
   grazed by cattle had food-web structures comparable to those in ungrazed
   playas, suggesting that playa biota may be adapted to large mammal
   disturbances. The trophic structure of ephemeral aquatic habitats may
   not respond to disturbance in the same way as permanent systems. Indeed,
   food chain length in a playa can actually increase as the ephemeral
   ecosystem approaches the end of its hydroperiod. Measures of ecosystem
   size need to include more than the two dimensions of surface area when
   being applied to general ecological theory. Food webs increase in
   complexity with time, and many of the same factors that control trophic
   structure in ephemeral habitats could be important at least at some time
   in the life of a relatively permanent ecosystem.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"O'Neill, BJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Kansas, Kansas Biol Survey, Higuchi Hall,2101 Constant Ave, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA.

   dealing with extreme environments",ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH,2018,27,3,767-784,JUL,"Generalist feeding strategies are favoured in stressful or variable
   environments where flexibility in ecological traits is beneficial.
   Species that feed across multiple habitat types and trophic levels may
   impart stability on food webs through the use of readily available,
   alternative energy pools. In lakes, generalist fish species may take
   advantage of spatially and temporally variable prey by consuming both
   benthic and pelagic prey to meet their energy demands. Using stomach
   content and stable isotope analyses, we examined the feeding habits of
   fish species in Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) lakes to determine
   the prevalence of generalist feeding strategies as a mechanism for
   persistence in extreme environments (e.g. low productivity, extreme cold
   and short growing season). Generalist and flexible feeding strategies
   were evident in five common fish species. Fish fed on benthic and
   pelagic (or nektonic) prey and across trophic levels. Three species were
   clearly omnivorous, feeding on fish and their shared invertebrate prey.
   Dietary differences based on stomach content analysis often exceeded
   70\%, and overlap in dietary niches based on shared isotopic space
   varied from zero to 40\%. Metrics of community-wide trophic structure
   varied with the number and identity of species involved and on the
   dietary overlap and niche size of individual fishes. Accumulation of
   energy from shared carbon sources by Arctic fishes creates redundancy in
   food webs, increasing likely resistance to perturbations or stochastic
   events. Therefore, the generalist and omnivorous feeding strategies
   employed by ACP fish may maintain energy flow and food web stability in
   extreme environments.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Laske, SM (Corresponding Author), US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.

   and temperature across Australian reefs",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2022,12,4,NA,APR,"Climate change and fisheries exploitation are dramatically changing the
   abundances, species composition, and size spectra of fish communities.
   We explore whether variation in `abundance size spectra', a widely
   studied ecosystem feature, is influenced by a parameter theorized to
   govern the shape of size-structured ecosystems-the relationship between
   the sizes of predators and their prey (predator-prey mass ratios, or
   PPMRs). PPMR estimates are lacking for avast number of fish species,
   including at the scale of trophic guilds. Using measurements of 8128
   prey items in gut contents of 97 reef fish species, we established
   predator-prey mass ratios (PPMRs) for four major trophic guilds
   (piscivores, invertivores, planktivores, and herbivores) using linear
   mixed effects models. To assess the theoretical predictions that higher
   community-level PPMRs leads to shallower size spectrum slopes, we
   compared observations of both ecosystem metrics for similar to 15,000
   coastal reef sites distributed around Australia. PPMRs of individual
   fishes were remarkably high (median similar to 71,000), with significant
   variation between different trophic guilds (similar to 890 for
   piscivores; similar to 83,000 for planktivores), and similar to 8700 for
   whole communities. Community-level PPMRs were positively related to size
   spectrum slopes, broadly consistent with theory, however, this pattern
   was also influenced by the latitudinal temperature gradient. Tropical
   reefs showed a stronger relationship between community-level PPMRs and
   community size spectrum slopes than temperate reefs. The extent that
   these patterns apply outside Australia and consequences for community

   consumption of zooplankton by fish, while the delta N-15 values for fish
   confirmed their wide trophic separation from zooplankton. Instead, SI
   values indicated that fish relied mostly on food resources of benthic
   origin (through direct consumption or piscivory). The SI signatures of
   individual fish species were consistent with their known feeding habits.
   The lack of trophic couplings between zooplankton and fish accords with
   previous gut content analyses of fish and analyses of zooplankton
   abundance and size structure in hypertrophic reservoirs. Marginal
   utilisation of zooplankton by indigenous reservoir fish is attributable
   to their native origin as riverine species unaccustomed to feeding on
   zooplankton. These findings indicate that top-down biomanipulation is
   unlikely to be effective as a management tool in eutrophic South African
   reservoirs. Primary producer components exhibited surprisingly wide and
   unsystematic temporal fluctuations in both delta C-13 and d15N values;
   some potential contributory factors are considered. Changes in
   phytoplankton d13C values were broadly tracked by zooplankton -their
   nominal consumers. Some questions arising from the study, and some

   of Pakistan",PLOS ONE,2013,8,8,NA,AUG 2,"Stable carbon isotope analysis in tooth enamel is a well-established
   approach to infer C-3 and C-4 dietary composition in fossil mammals. The
   bulk of past work has been conducted on large herbivorous mammals. One
   important finding is that their dietary habits of fossil large mammals
   track the late Miocene ecological shift from C-3 forest and woodland to
   C-4 savannah. However, few studies on carbon isotopes of fossil small
   mammals exist due to limitations imposed by the size of rodent teeth,
   and the isotopic ecological and dietary behaviors of small mammals to
   climate change remain unknown. Here we evaluate the impact of ecological
   change on small mammals by fine-scale comparisons of carbon isotope
   ratios (delta C-13) with dental morphology of murine rodents, spanning
   13.8 to similar to 2.0 Ma, across the C-3 to C-4 vegetation shift in the
   Miocene Siwalik sequence of Pakistan. We applied in-situ laser ablation
   GC-IRMS to lower first molars and measured two grazing indices on upper
   first molars. Murine rodents yield a distinct, but related, record of
   past ecological conditions from large herbivorous mammals, reflecting
   available foods in their much smaller home ranges. In general, larger
   murine species show more positive delta C-13 values and have higher
   grazing indices than smaller species inhabiting the same area at any
   given age. Two clades of murine rodents experienced different rates of
   morphological change. In the faster-evolving clade, the timing and trend
   of morphological innovations are closely tied to consumption of C-4 diet
   during the vegetation shift. This study provides quantitative evidence

   in the western Wadden Sea: evidence from stable isotope data analysis",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,2021,677,NA,115-128,OCT 28,"We studied the trophic structure of the western Wadden Sea fish
   community through stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of
   1658 samples from 57 fish species collected between 2012 and 2016.
   Stable isotope values differed between species but did not vary between
   years or seasons, and only for some species with fish size. Stable
   isotope values were not different between immigrating (spring) and
   emigrating (autumn) fish, suggesting a similar trophic niche of the
   various fish species in the coastal zone and inside the Wadden Sea. For
   the majority of species, average delta C-13 values were within the range
   of -12 to -20.5 parts per thousand, showing that both (marine) pelagic
   and benthic primary producers were at the base of the food web. Average
   delta N-15 values varied among species from 13-18 parts per thousand,
   resulting in estimated trophic positions (TPs) of 2.1-5.5 with the
   majority between 2.2 and 3.5. Thick-lipped grey mullet Chelon labrosus,
   golden grey mullet C. aurata, greater pipefish Syngnathus acus and
   pilchard Sardina pilchardus had the lowest TP (2.2-2.4). Among the
   common species (>10 observations), the highest TP values (3.4-3.5) were
   found for twaite shad Alosa fallax, smelt Osmerus eperlanus, bull-rout
   Myoxocephalus scomius, bass Dicentrarchus labrax and cod Gadus morhua.
   For all species, estimated TPs based on isotope values were lower than
   those based on stomach content composition (2.0-4.7), which could be
   explained by species-specific differences in trophic fractionation or by
   underestimation of the contribution of smaller prey species in the
   stomach content analysis. The trophic niche space of benthopelagic
   species was the smallest and overlapped with that of the pelagic and
   benthic species. In terms of area use, trophic niche space was smaller
   for juvenile marine migrant species (nursery-type species) and
   overlapped with that of the (near-)resident species and marine seasonal
   visitors. Potentially, trophic competition is highest for the functional
   group of benthopelagic species and the guild of juvenile marine migrant
   species (nursery-type species).",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",Article,English,"Poiesz, SSH (Corresponding Author), NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Coastal Syst, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands.

   multiple trophic pathways to stimulate planktonic food webs",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2023,68,5,821-836,MAY,"There is still considerable debate as to whether the allochthonous
   (terrestrial) dissolved organic matter (DOM) mobilised during large flow
   events plays an important role in supporting secondary production in
   riverine food webs. Understanding how food webs respond to large pulses
   of terrestrial DOM (tDOM) is important for conceptualising the relative
   importance of energy sources supporting food webs. A mesocosm experiment
   (1,000 L) using three concentrations of leachate (1, 4, 8 mg C/L and a
   control) made from floodplain DOM was run for 34 days in a dam filled
   with water from Gunbower Creek in Northern Victoria, Australia.
   Nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton and stable isotope (delta C-13
   signatures) data were collected to examine how floodplain nutrients
   affected growth and community structure within the lower food web
   typical of an Australian lowland river. All leachate additions led to
   very high concentrations of zooplankton and mixotrophic algae compared
   to the control. Mixotrophs dominated the algal biovolume of all leachate
   additions until Day (D)20 and appeared to drive changes in delta C-13
   signatures of particulate organic matter (POM) which were significantly
   related to changes in zooplankton delta C-13 signatures. tDOM additions
   did not significantly suppress obligate autotroph growth which also
   appeared important as a food source, as reflected in the delta C-13
   signatures of zooplankton and POM after D10. These results show the
   ability of phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in lowland rivers
   to respond quickly to changes in resource availability and quality.
   Mixotrophs appeared to provide an important trophic link between
   allochthonous carbon and primary consumers, and increased
   complimentarily to autotrophic production. This resulted in large net
   increases to phytoplankton biovolume and potentially played a
   significant role in driving changes in zooplankton growth. We suggest
   that allochthonous DOM may be highly bioavailable and support production
   through several different trophic pathways, offering a large boost to
   production via both autotrophy and heterotrophy. Furthermore, we contend
   that mixotrophy may be an important pathway for allochthonous organic
   matter to enter riverine food webs and support secondary production.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Balzer, MJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Technol, Sch Life Sci, Freshwater \& Estuarine Res Grp, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.

   local sources of water and fish. Two representative but contrasting
   crater lakes near the Kibale National Park were sampled in 2000; the
   hyper-eutrophic Lake Saka, which is highly affected by agricultural
   practices, and the mesotrophic Lake Nkuruba that is still surrounded by
   intact forest. The food web structures in these two lakes were assessed
   using stable nitrogen (delta(15)N) and carbon (delta(13)C) isotope
   analyses, and the mercury (THg) transfer patterns were quantified. The
   delta(15)N results indicate that food webs in both lakes are
   abbreviated, with only one to two trophic levels from primary consumers.
   The Lake Saka biota had distinctively enriched delta(13)C values
   compared with those in Lake Nkuruba, which may be due to (12)C-limited
   phytoplankton blooms in this lake. In Lake Nkuruba, two introduced
   tilapiine species and the introduced guppy Poecilia reticulata fed
   predominantly upon invertebrates and decomposed terrestrial plant
   material. In Lake Saka, the introduced Nile perch Lates niloticus
   appeared to occupy the top trophic position, but stable isotope values
   of the endemic haplochromine cichlids exclude those as Nile perch prey
   items. THg was found to biomagnify through the food web, reaching
   highest concentrations in P. reticulata in Nkuruba, which tended to be
   higher than for L. niloticus in Saka, suggesting increased
   bioavailability of THg in Nkuruba. Maximum THg concentrations in fish

   of zooplankton as an index of climate influences on pelagic food web
   structure in a major eastern boundary current ecosystem. Our analyses
   focused on two species of particle-grazing copepods (Calanus pacificus
   and Eucalanus californicus) and two species of carnivorous chaetognaths
   (Sagitta bierii and Sagitta euneritica), drawing on the CalCOFI
   zooplankton time series from both the southern and central sectors of
   the California Current System. We detected a significant difference
   between regions in average stable N isotope content of the two species
   of copepods, with delta N-15 elevated by 0.5-1.1 per mil in the southern
   region, but no regional differences in the isotopic content of the
   chaetognaths. We address climate influences over a 54-year time period,
   on three different time scales: interannual (dominated by ENSO),
   decadal, and multi-decadal. Three of four species showed evidence of an
   ENSO-related isotopic shift toward increased N-15 during El Nino
   conditions. In addition, in Southern California waters, C. pacificus and
   S. euneritica showed elevated delta N-15 in the warm phase of the NE
   Pacific between 1978 and 1998 relative to the preceding and following
   time periods. When considered over the entire 5 1/2 decades treated
   here, for most species there was remarkable long-term stability in
   stable isotope content in both southern and central California waters,
   despite interannual and decadal perturbations. Only E. californicus in
   the southern sector showed a significant downward secular trend in delta
   N-15. Variability of delta N-15 in 3 species covaried with the average
   nitrate concentration in the mixed layer, suggesting altered nitrate

   monospecific and multispecific lakes in western Patagonia",LIMNOLOGICA,2015,53,NA,50-59,JUL,"Percichthys trucha is a freshwater fish, endemic to southern South
   America and widely distributed in both, eastern and western sides of the
   Andes. P. trucha has been described as top native predator in lacustrine
   ecosystems, experimenting diet shifting during their life history
   development. Salmonid invasions have impacted their natural ecology
   through trophic niche interference and predation over alternative high
   quality prey. This study focuses on populations of P. trucha in western
   Patagonia, where its trophic ecology have been less understood. We
   hypothesised a diet shift between juveniles and adults from lowertrophic
   position prey towards higher-trophic position prey. Fish were collected
   from 7 lakes belonging to Puelo and Baker river basins, covering a high
   diversity of environmental conditions. Stomach content and delta N-15
   stable isotope ratio of muscle tissues of 313 individuals were analysed.
   Results indicate significant differences in diet between juveniles and
   adults, shifting from planktonic/benthic preys towards
   benthic/piscivory, and concomitantly enrichment in heavier nitrogen
   isotope suggest trophic scaling. No trophic scaling was observed in
   populations inhabiting lakes with any other fish species present,
   essentially due to lack of Galaxias sp. as available prey and absence of
   cannibalism. Despite the fact that P. trucha and Galaxias sp. co-occur
   in studied river basins, no salmonid-free lakes harbouring this two
   native species were found, making it difficult to elucidate exact
   effects of salmonids on trophic scaling of P. trucha. Consumption of
   aquatic Odonata nymphs, however, arises as one of potential key
   mechanism for resilience of native food webs to salmonid invasion. (C)

   of grassland arthropods",JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,2020,89,5,1286-1294,MAY,"We investigate where bottom-up and top-down control regulates ecological
   communities as a mechanism linking ecological gradients to the geography
   of consumer abundance and biomass. We use standardized surveys of 54
   North American grasslands to test alternate hypotheses predicting
   100-fold shifts in the biomass of four common grassland arthropod
   taxa-Auchenorrhyncha, sucking herbivores, Acrididae, chewing herbivores,
   Tettigoniidae, omnivores, and Araneae, predators.
   Bottom-up models predict that consumer biomass tracks plant quantity
   (e.g. productivity and standing biomass) and quality (nutrient content)
   and that ectotherm access to food increases with temperature. Each of
   the focal trophic groups responded differently to these drivers: the
   biomass of sucking herbivores and omnivores increased with plant
   biomass; that of chewing herbivores tracked plant quality; and predator
   biomass did not depend on plant quality, plant quantity or temperature.
   The Exploitation Ecosystem Hypothesis is a top-down hypothesis that
   predicts a shift from resource limitation of herbivores when plant
   production is low, to predator limitation when plant production is high.
   In grasslands where spider biomass was low, herbivore biomass increased
   with plant biomass, whereas bottom-up structuring was not evident when
   spiders were abundant. Furthermore, neither predator biomass nor trophic
   position (via stable isotope analysis) increased with plant biomass,
   suggesting predators themselves are top-down limited.
   Stable isotope analysis revealed that trophic position of the chewing
   herbivore and omnivore increased significantly with plant biomass,
   suggesting these groups increased scavenging and meat consumption in
   grasslands with higher carbohydrate availability.
   Taken together, our snapshot sampling documents gradients of food web
   structure across 54 grasslands, consistent with multiple hypotheses of

   modifications in the dynamics of primary producers and/or
   benthic-pelagic coupling under climate change. However, lack of
   knowledge about the influence of physical constraints (e.g. ice-melting
   associated gradients) on organic matter sources, quality, and transfers
   in systems such as fjords can impede predictions of the evolution of
   benthic-pelagic coupling in response to global warming. Here, sources
   and quality of particulate organic matter (POM) and sedimentary organic
   matter (SOM) were characterized along an inner-outer gradient in a High
   Artic fjord (Young Sound, NE Greenland) exposed to extreme seasonal and
   physical constraints (ice-melting associated gradients). The influence
   of the seasonal variability of food sources on 2 dominant filter-feeding
   bivalves (Astarte moerchi and Mya truncata) was also investigated.
   Results revealed the critical impact of long sea ice/snow cover
   conditions prevailing in Young Sound corresponding to a period of
   extremely poor and degraded POM and SOM. Freshwater inputs had a very
   local impact during summer, with relatively more degraded POM at the
   surface compared to bottom waters that were less nutritionally depleted
   but more heterogeneous among the sampled stations. Terrestrial inputs
   contributed to the SOM composition but showed a large variability along
   the fjord. Finally, diet analyses underlined the contrasted nutritional
   conditions, showing much higher lipid reserves in A. moerchi than in M.
   truncata during winter. Under a scenario with increased freshwater
   input, such results suggest a decline in organic matter quality and

   climate change. To date, no long-term empirical studies have confirmed
   that fish populations exhibit adaptive foraging behavior in response to
   temperature variation and the potential implications this has on
   fitness. Here, we use an unparalleled 11-y acoustic telemetry, stable
   isotope, and mark-recapture dataset to test if a population of lake
   trout (Salvelinus namaycush), a cold-water stenotherm, adjusted its use
   of habitat and energy sources in response to annual variations in lake
   temperatures during the open-water season and how these changes
   translated to the growth and condition of individual fish. We found that
   climate influenced access to littoral regions in spring (data from
   telemetry), which in turn influenced energy acquisition (data from
   isotopes), and growth (mark-recapture data). In more stressful years,
   those with shorter springs and longer summers, lake trout had reduced
   access to littoral habitat and assimilated less littoral energy,
   resulting in reduced growth and condition. Annual variation in prey
   abundance influenced lake trout foraging tactics (i.e., the balance of
   the number and duration of forays) but not the overall time spent in
   littoral regions. Lake trout greatly reduced their use of littoral
   habitat and occupied deep pelagic waters during the summer. Together,
   our results provide clear evidence that climate-mediated behavior can
   influence the dominant energy pathways of top predators, with
   implications ranging from individual fitness to food web stability.",NATL ACAD SCIENCES,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",Article,English,"Guzzo, MM (Corresponding Author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.

   events is currently limited. We report the resilience of aquatic
   community to a 100-year record-high flood, and how it varies depending
   on levels of water pollution, in a fourth-order gravel-bed river in
   northern Japan. We used data on riparian landscape structure, channel
   morphology, and community structure of aquatic fauna, which were
   collected in sites with and without effluent before (1 month-3 years)
   and after (10 months) the flood. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope
   ratios of consumers and basal resources were measured only before (1
   year) the flood. We observed aquatic food web with introduced rainbow
   trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as the top predator, with variable relative
   contributions of basal resources and their pathways to the rainbow
   trout, under the effects of water pollution. Biofilm-originating dietary
   carbon became the more dominant resource, with a slightly shorter
   food-chain length in the polluted sites. The flood led to a loss of
   riparian forest and a substantial increase in the proportion of exposed
   gravel bars (5-24\%). While the average river-bed elevation changed a
   little, the localized scours of river bed down to > 2 m were observed
   with lateral shifts of channel thalweg. Despite the landscape-level
   physical and structural changes of ecosystem, aquatic community showed a
   remarkably high resilience exhibiting negligible changes in abundance,
   except in the polluted site where only fish abundance showed a slight
   decrease. This study suggests that the abundance of aquatic organisms in

   generalist (where myriad plant species comprise relatively small
   proportions of overall diet) to a specialist diet (where plants species
   constitute much larger proportions of said diet). What may be more
   telling is that in (anthropogenically disturbed) portions of the native
   habitat, and progressively more so in non-native habitats, invasive
   apple snail diets are increasingly composed of aquatic plants. The
   inherent and pronounced dietary differences amongst pristine and
   anthropogenically disturbed native habitats, as well as non-native

Article,Marcel Klaassen and Theunis Piersma and Harry Korthals and Anne Dekinga and Maurine W. Dietz,"Single-point isotope measurements in blood cells and plasma to estimate
   the time since diet switches",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,2010,24,4,796-804,AUG,"P>1. Understanding ecological phenomena often requires an accurate
   assessment of the timing of events. To estimate the time since a diet
   shift in animals without knowledge on the isotope ratios of either the
   old or the new diet, isotope ratio measurements in two different tissues
   (e.g. blood plasma and blood cells) at a single point in time can be
   used. For this `isotopic-clock' principle, we present here a
   mathematical model that yields an analytical and easily calculated
   outcome.
   2. Compared with a previously published model, our model assumes the
   isotopic difference between the old and new diets to be constant if
   multiple measurements are taken on the same subject at different points
   in time. Furthermore, to estimate the time since diet switch, no
   knowledge of the isotopic signature of tissues under the old diet, but
   only under the new diet is required.
   3. The two models are compared using three calibration data sets
   including a novel one based on a diet shift experiment in a shorebird
   (red knot Calidris canutus); sensitivity analyses were conducted. The
   two models behaved differently and each may prove rather unsatisfactory
   depending on the system under investigation. A single-tissue model,
   requiring knowledge of both the old and new diets, generally behaved
   quite reliably.
   4. As blood (cells) and plasma are particularly useful tissues for
   isotopic-clock research, we trawled the literature on turnover rates in
   whole blood, cells and plasma. Unfortunately, turnover rate predictions
   using allometric relations are too unreliable to be used directly in
   isotopic-clock calculations.
   5. We advocate that before applying the isotopic-clock methodology, the
   propagation of error in the `time-since-diet-shift' estimation is
   carefully assessed for the system under scrutiny using a sensitivity
   analysis as proposed here.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Klaassen, M (Corresponding Author), Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life \& Environm Sci, Waurn Ponds Campus, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia.

   broad-spectrum hunter-gatherer economy to a millet-based production
   economy during the early and middle Neolithic periods in northern China,
   especially the changes in the contribution of millet to the human diet
   structure over time. Here we conducted an AMS-C-14 dating and carbon and
   nitrogen stable isotope analysis on human and animal bones spanning the
   Houli culture period to the Beixin culture period unearthed from the
   Houli site in the Haidai region, Shandong, China. The results show that
   the diet of humans living in the Houli culture period contained a small
   amount of C-4 plant food, likely millets. Here, the earliest data of
   human stable isotopes with direct AMS-C-14 dating (8,323 cal. BP-8,178
   cal. BP) in the Haidai region indicated that primitive millet
   agriculture originated under the broad-spectrum economic model of
   hunter-gatherer during c. 8,300 BP at the latest. The diet of humans
   living in the Beixin culture period (5,987 cal. BP-5,726 cal. BP)
   contained a large amount of C-4 food, likely millet-based food, showing
   that millet-based agriculture became a dominant part of the production
   economy in the Haidai region. A dietary shift with gradient millet
   consumption appeared in the Haidai region of China during the early and
   middle Neolithic periods (c. 8,300 BP-c. 6,000 BP), indicating that

   the coastal waters of Jiangsu based on carbon and nitrogen isotope
   technology",ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,2022,297,NA,NA,MAR 15,"Research on food web structures in marine ecosystems is an important
   field in ecology where the interaction of structure and function
   contributes to understanding biodiversity. The coastal waters of Jiangsu
   are one of the important fishing bases in China. In recent years, with
   the development of industry in the coastal waters of Jiangsu, heavy
   metal (HM) pollution in this region has become more serious. In this
   study, all samples (including macroalgae, bivalves, cephalopods,
   gastropods, crustaceans and fish) were collected in the coastal waters
   of Jiangsu in spring, summer and autumn. Based on the construction of
   the food web structure using carbon and nitrogen isotope technology, the
   main methods of material circulation and energy flow were quantified,
   and the accumulation regularity and seasonal variation characteristics
   of HMs in the food web were analysed. The results showed that (1) among
   all the trophic groups, bivalves had the highest enrichment level of
   HMs, while fish had the lowest. However, fish have a strong ability to
   enrich Hg, and the main source of Hg enrichment in the human body is
   edible fish, so more attention should be given to Hg concentrations in
   fish. (2) In spring, the mean HM concentrations of marine organisms in
   the coastal waters of Jiangsu were Zn > Cu > As > Cd > Cr > Pb > Ni >
   Hg, and they were Zn > Cu > As > Pb > Cd > Ni > Cr > Hg in summer and Zn
   > Cu > As > Pb > Cd > Cr > Ni > Hg in autumn. In total, the
   concentrations of Zn, Cu and As were the highest, while the mean
   concentration of Hg in organisms was the lowest. (3) No significant
   biomagnification of HMs was found in the three seasons. We speculated
   that overfishing leads to miniaturization and a younger age of
   organisms, which makes the concentration of highly enriched HMs in
   organisms with high trophic levels (TLs) lower.",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Zhang, S (Corresponding Author), Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.

   structure of carnivorous fish. We censused fish and analysed the stable
   isotope ratios of C and N of species targeted by fishermen in areas open
   to fishing and marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Mediterranean Sea
   and the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean. Results demonstrated a major
   impact of fishing on the biomass and size structure of nektobenthic
   carnivorous fish. However, those changes did not modify the diversity of
   the trophic resources used by the assemblage, the pattern of resource
   partitioning between species, or the degree of trophic redundancy. These
   results add to recent evidence suggesting that MPAs implemented in
   fished seascapes may fail to restore the original structure of the food
   webs that once existed in pre-fished ecosystems because regional
   decimation and extinction of highly mobile predators prevent recovering
   the original diversity of predators at local scales, even in no-take
   areas. If so, more strict local fishing regulations are unlikely to
   restore the original diversity of high trophic level carnivores and
   restoration goals should be reframed in terms of an objective that is
   less unrealistic than restoring the pre-fished condition while still
   recovering aspects of the historical trophic structure.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Cardona, L (Corresponding Author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, IRBio, Barcelona 08028, Spain.

   affecting the Baker River basin have increased their frequency in recent
   years. To evaluate the impact of a GLOF in the hydrography and
   biological components of the plankton in the Baker Fjord, we assessed
   the relative contributions of terrigenous versus marine plankton carbon
   sources to the particulate organic matter (POM) in the fjord before and
   after a GLOF in the austral summer 2014. We also evaluated whether
   terrestrial carbon brought into the fjord by the river may reach higher
   trophic levels via a deposit-feeding organism the juvenile pelagic
   Munida gregaria. Over a 10-day period, hydrographic profiles, water
   samples for POM, and zooplankton samples were collected daily from three
   stations and two depths along the fjord's inner section. Samples of
   suspended POM and tissue from M. gregaria were analyzed for
   stable-isotope composition of carbon (C-13). The GLOF arrival produced a
   thermal front in the fjord, followed by an oscillation of the
   pycnocline; an abrupt increase in the total organic carbon content of
   POM, which was attributed to terrestrial input; and a concurrent peak in
   the abundance of M. gregaria, suggesting an aggregation response to the
   GLOF. Understanding GLOF effects on local hydrography, productivity, and
   food web structure provides valuable insight on the potential responses
   of fjord ecosystems in general to climate change-induced variability.
   Given present climatic trends in high-latitude zones, more frequent

   and success, especially for offshore benthic organisms that rely on
   sinking particles as their main food supply. Temporal changes in the
   quantity and quality of food sources, often linked to shifts in the
   prevailing hydrographic conditions, thus have important consequences for
   benthic community composition and ecosystem functioning. Here, we
   investigate variability in the biochemical composition of offshore
   benthic organisms and their food sources across different time-scales (3
   weeks, 1 year, 2 years) at the Sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands
   (PEIs) using nitrogen and carbon stable isotope (SI; delta N-15 and
   delta C-13, respectively) and fatty acid (FA) analyses. The delta N-15
   of suspended particulate matter (SPM) did not show a consistent trend
   over time, probably because the primary driver of delta N-15(SPM)
   variability appears to be seasonality and we sampled at roughly the same
   time each year. In contrast, the delta C-13(SPM) increased with time,
   likely as a result of the changing proportion of macroalgal detritus
   relative to offshore phytoplankton biomass. The delta N-15 and delta
   C-13 of select trophic groups varied with time, but not necessarily in
   synchrony with the SPM, possibly due to differences in the SI turnover
   rates of the food sources versus the consumers. In contrast, the FA
   composition of most taxa did change over time, reflecting the shorter
   integration period for FA compared to SI. While taxa showed different FA
   patterns across the time-scales investigated, the dominant trend was one
   of decreasing food quality with time. Combined, the SI and FA results
   indicate that the response of the benthos to the factor Time is not
   straightforward. We conclude that the two techniques provide different
   yet complementary temporal information, with animal SI ratios reflecting
   the longer-term and FA composition the shorter-term response of the
   benthos to changing food availability. Our findings suggest that
   different species at the PEIs will respond differently to climate-driven
   changes in food quality and quantity, increasing the uncertainty facing

   lakes",ECOSYSTEMS,2003,6,3,289-299,APR,"Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) is a recent invader to the lakes of the
   Hudson Bay drainage in northwestern Ontario, Canada. In some systems,
   the invasion has been linked to an increase in mercury (Hg)
   concentration in native predatory fish. This increase may be due to the
   fact that rainbow smelt are trophically elevated and thus accumulate
   more Ho than native forage fish species. To test this hypothesis, we
   compared the trophic positions and Hg concentrations of rainbow smelt
   and native forage fish in a series of smelt-invaded and reference lakes
   in northwestern Ontario. A comparison of forage fish delta(15)N (anindex
   of trophic position) between the smelt-invaded and reference lakes
   indicated that rainbow smelt moved into a trophic niche that was
   unoccupied prior to their arrival. Relationships between delta(15)N and
   body size and between Hg concentration and body size differed among the
   forage species. This indicates that the response of predator Hg
   concentrations to smelt invasion depends on both the species and size
   composition of their pre-versus post-invasion diet. At a standardized
   body mass of 10 g, rainbow smelt were significantly trophically elevated
   relative to most native forage species, but they did not have
   significantly higher muscle Hg concentrations. Relationships between Hg
   concentration and delta(15)N were weak, both within and among forage
   fish species. This study shows that trophic elevation on a fine scale
   (within the forage fish community) may not result in increased
   contaminant bioaccumulation. It further challenges the general

   trophic structure of a fish community and the trophic levels of dominant
   fish species off the eastern coast of Korea. We analyzed the community
   composition and the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (delta
   C-13 and delta N-15) for fish species in Hupo coastal waters over four
   seasons. Fish assemblages were mainly dominated by resident benthic and
   benthopelagic fish. In contrast, there were low numbers of pelagic fish,
   including migrating and occasional species, which varied significantly
   by season. The fish assemblages generally had relatively wide ranges of
   delta C-13 and delta N-15 (- 21.1 to - 16.3 parts per thousand and 10.0
   to 14.2 parts per thousand, respectively), reflecting a clear
   distinction between resident (mostly benthic or benthopelagic) vs
   migratory (mostly pelagic) fish. Resident species showed no seasonal
   differences in their isotopic signatures, whereas pelagic species showed
   temporal variability in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. The isotopic
   niche of fish assemblages showed distinctly different patterns between
   spring-summer and winter-fall with the seasonal changes in the fish
   community. These patterns might be associated with seasonal variation in
   the fish community caused by seasonal changes in environmental

   information through all levels of the food web. Their tissues can be
   used to investigate spatiotemporal variability in foraging behaviour,
   and with the appropriate analytical methods and tools, archived samples
   can be used to reconstruct past trophic interactions. Harp seal
   Pagophilus groenlandicus teeth collected in the 1990s from the Northwest
   Atlantic were analysed for bulk stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes
   (delta C-13(bulk) and delta N-15(bulk)), and compound-specific stable

   developed a fine-scale, annual growth layer group (GLG) dentine

   In accordance with previous diet studies, while there was individual
   variability in delta N-15(bulk), delta C-13(bulk) and delta N-15(AA)
   measurements, we did not detect significant differences in isotopic
   niche widths between males and females, or between GLGs. Relative
   trophic position was calculated as the baseline-corrected delta N-15(AA)
   values using trophic (glutamic acid) and source (phenylalanine and
   glycine) amino acids. Variability was measured between individuals in
   their relative trophic position, but withinindividual variability was
   low, suggesting that they fed at the same trophic level over these 2 yr
   of life. These novel delta N-15(AA) data may therefore suggest
   individual, specialist harp seal foraging behaviour in sub-adults. Our

   However, their ability to adjust their behaviors in response to changes
   in environmental conditions and food web structure, which is important
   in light of climate change and continued anthropogenic disturbance, is
   still unclear in many ecosystems. We combined stomach content and stable
   isotope analyses to study the trophic ecology and plasticity of the
   dominant top predators-the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas and the
   alligator gar Atractosteus spatula-in 2 estuaries of the northwestern
   Gulf of Mexico. Both species showed a high degree of prey preference and
   predominantly fed on mugilids. Juvenile bull sharks were also demersal
   foragers with a high relative trophic position (TP approximate to 4),
   feeding heavily on sea catfishes (Bagre marinus and Ariopsis felis) and
   red drum Sciaenops ocellatus. Comparatively, alligator gars were ambush
   foragers with TP approximate to 3 that targeted schools of gulf menhaden
   Brevoortia patronus. Sharks and gars exhibited overlap in their trophic
   interactions, indicating potential competition for prey, but our results
   highlight mechanisms that mitigate competition, including spatial
   partitioning and intraspecific variability. The diets of both species
   also appeared highly flexible, with individuals able to adjust to
   spatiotemporal shifts in prey availability. These findings suggest the
   bull shark and the alligator gar may be somewhat resilient to the
   ecological change associated with climate change and anthropogenic
   disturbances and highlight the utility of combining different approaches

   Stable isotope analyses indicated that Smallmouth Bass trophic position

   watershed size categories were small (ranging from 3.6 to 3.8) and of
   limited ecological significance. Isotopic niche width did not vary among

   fundamentally alter food web structure and energy flows through changes
   in productivity, resource availability, and community assembly. Dam
   flow-release schemes can be used to mitigate the environmental impacts
   of flow regulation via environmental flows, which can increase discharge
   variability and other ecologically important hydrological properties. In
   particular, managed floods can reintroduce disturbance to the system and
   stimulate the reactivation of physical habitat dynamics. However, how
   managed floods might restore ecosystem processes is virtually unknown.
   In this study, we examined patterns in potential energy fluxes before,
   during and after a long-term experimental flood program on the river
   Spol, a regulated alpine River in southeast Switzerland. We used benthic
   samples collected during long-term monitoring and stable isotope
   analysis (\& delta;C-13 and \& delta;N-15) of macroinvertebrates and
   their potential food sources to reconstruct secondary production, and
   potential energy fluxes, over a 20-year study period. The experimental
   floods did not alter the relative importance of basal resources but
   resulted in a considerable decline in secondary production, which
   remained low after the discontinuation of the floods. Our data suggest
   that a lack of recolonization by mosses following the discontinuation of
   the experimental flood program on the river Spol may have driven
   patterns in energy fluxes by limiting macroinvertebrates using mosses
   for habitat. The effects of environmental flows on energy flows in this
   system thus depend on flood disturbance and the environmental context

   pathways, phagotrophic protists comprise one to several levels of
   intermediate consumers between phytoplankton and larger metazooplankton
   (copepods and krill). However, recent attempts to quantify pelagic
   trophic structure in the open ocean using nitrogen stable isotope
   techniques have brought into question whether such measurements
   adequately account for protistan trophic steps. Here, we use a two-stage
   chemostat system, with Dunaliella tertiolecta and Oxyrrhis marina as a
   predator-prey model, to address this question experimentally. To
   investigate N-15 trophic discrimination under different conditions of
   nitrogen availability and recycling, Oxyrrhis was fed in the light and
   in the dark on phytoplankton provided with high and low nutrient ratios
   of N : P. We used both bulk and amino acids-compound specific isotopic
   analysis (AA CSIA) to distinguish trophic fractionation from changes in
   the delta N-15 values of phytoplankton (isotopic baseline). Results
   demonstrate that protistan consumers are not, in fact, significantly
   enriched in N-15 relative to their prey, a marked departure from the
   general findings for metazoan consumers. In addition, we show that
   changes in the isotopic baseline propagate rapidly through the protistan
   food chain, highlighting the need to account for this variability at
   ecologically relevant time scales. If protistan trophic steps are
   largely invisible or significantly underestimated using nitrogen isotope
   measurements, research that utilize such measurements in ecological,
   fisheries, and climate change studies may miss a large part of the
   ocean's variability in food-web structure and ecosystem function.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Gutiérrez-Rodríguez, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Integrat Oceanog Div, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.

   of the Beaufort Sea",ESTUARIES AND COASTS,2012,35,2,416-435,MAR,"The eastern Alaska Beaufort Sea coast is characterized by numerous
   shallow (2-5 m) estuarine lagoons, fed by streams and small rivers that
   drain northward from the Brooks Range through the arctic coastal plain,
   and bounded seaward by barrier islands and shoals. Millions of birds
   from six continents nest and forage during the summer period in this
   region using the river deltas, lagoons, and shoreline along with several
   species of anadromous and marine fish. We examined biogeochemical
   processes linking the benthic community to the overall food web
   structure of these poorly studied but pristine estuaries, which are
   largely covered by 1.8 m of ice for 10 months annually. In summer, these
   lagoons are relatively warm with brackish salinities (5-10A degrees C, S
   = 10-25) compared to more open coastal waters (0-5A degrees C, S > 27).
   The stable isotopic composition of organic materials in sediments (i.e.,
   benthic particulate organic matter) and water column suspended
   particulate organic matter from both streams and lagoons are largely
   indistinguishable and reflect strong terrestrial contributions, based
   upon delta C-13 and delta N-15 values (-25.6aEuro degrees to -27.4aEuro
   degrees and 1.4aEuro degrees to 3.3aEuro degrees, respectively). By
   comparison, shifts toward more heavy isotope-enriched organic materials
   reflecting marine influence are observed on the adjacent coastal shelf
   (-24.8aEuro degrees to -25.4aEuro degrees and 3.4aEuro degrees to
   5.3aEuro degrees, respectively). The isotopic composition of lagoon
   fauna is consistent with a food web dominated by omnivorous detritovores
   strongly dependent on microbial processing of terrestrial sources of
   carbon. Biomagnification of N-15 in benthic organisms indicate that the
   benthic food web in lagoons support up to four trophic levels, with
   carnivorous gastropod predators and benthic fishes (delta N-15 values up
   to 14.4aEuro degrees) at the apex.",SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",Article,English,"Dunton, KH (Corresponding Author), Univ Texas Austin, Inst Marine Sci, 750 Channel View Dr, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA.

   aquatic-terrestrial boundary?",ECOSPHERE,2018,9,4,NA,APR,"The longitudinal influences of dam removal on river ecosystems are
   increasingly well described, but impacts to aquatic-terrestrial
   connectivity are largely unknown. Before and four successive years after
   dam removal, we quantified density and trophic metrics of nearshore
   tetragnathid spiders and riparian swallows and their potential
   emergent-aquatic insect prey at two experimental reaches located within
   the former impoundment (one unrestored, one with channel restoration)
   and one control reach above an intact lowhead dam. We observed
   substantial annual variability in response variables; however, few
   patterns appear to be strongly linked to dam removal. We found
   negligible changes in emergent-insect biomass or community structure,
   although there were slight changes in the relative abundance of feeding
   modes (e.g., increased predators, decreased collector-gatherers). The
   most pronounced response was a similar to 9.9 times average decline in
   spider densities after dam removal at the restored reach. Stable-isotope
   analysis (C-13, N-15) indicated that changes in aquatically-derived
   energy (i.e., nutritional subsidies derived from aquatic primary
   producers) to riparian consumers generally showed comparable patterns
   system-wide; swallow aquatically-derived energy declined more in the
   restored vs. control reach by the final year of the study. Trophic
   position (TP) of spiders showed little change post-dam removal, while
   swallow TP converged slightly between control and experimental reaches
   after dam removal. Collectively, we interpret our results as evidence
   that lowhead dam removal can prompt relatively nuanced shifts in
   aquatic-terrestrial trophic dynamics, regardless of intensive
   channel-restoration activities. In contrast, we found that broader-scale
   forcings (e.g., discharge, regional temperature) may be more influential
   in governing cross-boundary trophic interactions than the perturbations
   related to lowhead dam removal. This study furthers current
   understanding of the effects of dam removal on integrative, food-web
   metrics of ecosystem structure and function.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Sullivan, SMP (Corresponding Author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm \& Nat Resources, Schiermeier Olentangy River Wetland Res Pk, Columbus, OH 43202 USA.

   heavily exploited coastal marine ecosystem off Central Vietnam",FISHERIES RESEARCH,2011,110,2,268-276,JUL,"We examined the community and trophic structure of the heavily exploited
   benthic-demersal community off Phan Thiet Bay, Central Vietnam. Using
   cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) of catch
   data from a trawl survey, we examined the nekton community structure
   pertaining to bottom substrate type and depth. For dominant fish and
   invertebrate taxa we applied stable isotope analysis, using delta N-15
   to examine trophic level (TL) and size-specific ontogenetic shifts, and
   delta C-13 as a measure of contribution by benthic secondary production.
   Based on trawl data small fishes and cephalopods were the numerically
   and biomass-dominant taxa. Community structure analysis showed many of
   the sample sites shared the same species composition, but that there was
   significant heterogeneity related to substrate types of sand and
   gravelly muddy sand. Results from delta N-15 showed 70\% of the species
   were between TL 3.3 and 3.8. with no species indicating true piscivory
   (TL 4); highest TL was from the squid Loligo japonica (TL 3.8).
   Size-specific delta N-15-based trophic shift was expressed in taxa when
   the proportional size range (Delta L-max) obtained for analysis was at
   least 40\% of the largest reported size for the species (L-max). From
   delta C-13, nekton expressed between 35 and 77\% dependence on benthic
   secondary production. Evidence of over-exploitation from our study
   included the relatively low TL's of dominant taxa, small size
   distribution of specimens collected, and the dominance of taxa with very
   high growth rates such as cephalopods (juvenile Octopus sp. and
   cuttlefish) and small fishes. The effectiveness of stable isotopes as an
   indicator of over-exploitation is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

   hampers their conservation management in Japan, where stocks have only
   partially recovered from heavy exploitation in previous centuries. We
   used stable isotope ratios of delta C-13 and delta N-15 for turtle
   carapace scutes, where successive layers contain a chronological record
   of diet assimilated over a period of years. Turtles were sampled at 2
   geographically separate foraging grounds in Japan: the temperate Main
   Islands (n = 32) and the sub-tropical Nansei Islands (n = 42). Site
   fidelity was inferred for the majority of turtles at each site (81 and
   64\% resident turtles) because isotope data indicated diets consistent
   with food taxa at the respective sites. Immigrant turtles (previous diet
   outside their current site) were few (n = 4) at the Main Islands site
   but numerous (n = 14) at the Nansei Islands site, where they were
   significantly smaller than residents. An ontogenetic shift (Main Islands
   to Nansei Islands) was inferred for many of the immigrants on the basis
   of isotope evidence and body size. These immigrants corresponded to a
   size cohort that was relatively scarce in Main Islands foraging grounds
   according to previous studies. Bayesian mixing models, used to estimate
   proportional components of diet, showed varying degrees of imbalance
   between sea-grass and algae and indicated that hypothetical consumption
   of non-trivial amounts of animal matter was plausible. The latter
   represented a hypothetical diet component for study turtles since animal
   matter was rarely found in stomach contents. Potential ambiguity and

   in response to a changing climate",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,2022,28,23,7009-7022,DEC,"Arctic ecosystems are changing dramatically with warmer and wetter
   conditions resulting in complex interactions between herbivores and
   their forage. We investigated how Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus
   platyrhynchus) modify their late winter diets in response to long-term
   trends and interannual variation in forage availability and
   accessibility. By reconstructing their diets and foraging niches over a
   17-year period (1995-2012) using serum delta C-13 and delta N-15 values,
   we found strong support for a temporal increase in the proportions of
   graminoids in the diets with a concurrent decline in the contributions
   of mosses. This dietary shift corresponds with graminoid abundance
   increases in the region and was associated with increases in population
   density, warmer summer temperatures and more frequent rain-on-snow (ROS)
   in winter. In addition, the variance in isotopic niche positions,
   breadths, and overlaps also supported a temporal shift in the foraging
   niche and a dietary response to extreme ROS events. Our long-term study
   highlights the mechanisms by which winter and summer climate changes
   cascade through vegetation shifts and herbivore population dynamics to
   alter the foraging niche of Svalbard reindeer. Although it has been
   anticipated that climate changes in the Svalbard region of the Arctic
   would be detrimental to this unique ungulate, our study suggests that

   analysis of the stable isotopes of(13)C and(15)N in the environment,
   were carried out on samples collected during spring 2010 in two
   reservoirs: Ghrib and Harreza of the upper Cheliff plain (Algeria)

   were measured in sediments, particulate organic matter (POM),
   macrophytes, zooplankton, zoobenthos and fish. The isotopic analysis
   shows that the carbon values that supply both reservoirs, Ghrib and
   Harreza, were -31.16 +/- 0.05 <C-13 < -18.01 +/- 0.21 parts per thousand

   differ among southeast Alaska streams",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2013,58,5,938-950,MAY,"1.Adult Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) transport marine nutrients to
   fresh waters and disturb sediments during spawning. The relative
   importance of nutrient fertilisation and benthic disturbance by salmon
   spawners can be modulated by environmental conditions (e.g. biological,
   chemical and physical conditions in the catchment, including human land
   use). 2.To determine the importance of the environmental context in
   modifying the uptake and incorporation of salmon-derived material into
   stream biota, we measured the nitrogen (15N) and carbon (13C) isotopic
   composition of benthic algae (i.e. epilithon) and juvenile coho salmon
   (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in seven streams across a timber-harvest gradient
   (869\% catchment area harvested), both before and during the salmon run.
   Conditional bootstrap modelling simulations were used to assess
   variability in the response of epilithon and juvenile coho salmon to
   spawning salmon. 3.In response to spawning salmon, epilithon exhibited
   enrichment in both 15N (mean: 1.5 parts per thousand) and 13C (2.3 parts
   per thousand). Juvenile coho were also enriched in both 15N (0.7 parts
   per thousand) and 13C (1.4 parts per thousand). Conditional bootstrap
   models indicate decreased variation in data as spatial replication
   increases, suggesting that the number of study sites can influence the
   results of Pacific salmon isotope studies. 4.Epilithon isotopic
   enrichment was predicted by environmental conditions, with 15N
   enrichment predicted by stream temperature and timber harvest (R2=0.87)
   and 13C enrichment by discharge, sediment size, timber harvest and
   spawner density (R2=0.96). Furthermore, we found evidence for a legacy
   effect of salmon spawners, with pre-spawner 15N and 13C of both
   epilithon and juvenile coho predicted by salmon run size in the previous
   year. 5.Our results show that the degree of incorporation of
   salmon-derived nitrogen and carbon differs among streams. Furthermore,
   the environmental context, including putative legacy effects of spawning
   salmon, can influence background isotopic concentrations and utilisation
   of salmon-derived materials in southeast Alaska salmon streams. Future
   studies should consider the variation in isotopic composition of stream
   biota when deciding on the number of study sites and samples needed to
   generate meaningful results.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Reisinger, AJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.

   in wild-caught black rockfish <i>Sebastes melanops</i>",AQUATIC BIOLOGY,2015,23,3,201-208,NA,"Otolith carbon isotope delta C-13 values may provide temporally resolved
   diet proxies in fish. If otolith delta C-13 values reflect diet, isotope
   values from recent otolith and muscle tissue should correlate and known
   ontogenetic diet shifts should be reflected in comparisons between
   otolith material deposited during different life history stages. We
   analyzed paired otolith and muscle samples for delta C-13 from black
   rockfish Sebastes melanops to examine the potential of otoliths to
   reflect diet in small (200-299 mm fork length) and large (>= 300 mm)
   fish. We found a significant positive regression between delta C-13
   values from recent (similar to 12 mo) otolith material and muscle in
   large fish, but not in small fish. Within individual otoliths, delta
   C-13 values were enriched by similar to 3 parts per thousand in recent
   otolith edge material compared to age-0 otolith core material and were
   consistent with known nearshore-offshore gradients in delta C-13 values
   at the base of the food web. Bulk otolith delta C-13 appeared to provide
   a broad indicator of dietary carbon sources, but variation in metabolism
   and dissolved inorganic carbon delta C-13 among and within individuals
   likely influences otolith delta C-13 as well and limits precision.
   Nevertheless, the results are promising and bulk otolith delta C-13 may
   be an appropriate tool to examine large trophic and ecosystem level
   shifts that have occurred concurrently with changes in habitat,
   commercial fishing, invasive species, climate change, and other direct
   or indirect human impacts using historic or ancient otoliths. Future
   studies should continue to consider the utility of bulk otolith delta

   potential negative impacts on native salmonids and recipient ecosystems.
   The eggs and carcasses of semelparous pink salmon may provide a
   significant nutrient and energy subsidy to native biota, but this
   phenomenon has not been widely documented outside the species' native
   distribution. We analysed the stomach contents and stable isotope values
   (delta N-15 and delta C-13) in muscle and liver tissues of juvenile
   Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) to
   determine whether these native salmonids utilise marine-derived
   nutrients and energy provided by pink salmon eggs and carcasses in the
   subarctic river system Vesterelva, northern Norway. Although egg
   foraging and assimilation of marine-derived nutrients in fish body
   tissues were found to be minor at the population level, a few juvenile
   salmon and trout had recently eaten large quantities of pink salmon
   eggs. Some of these individuals also had high delta N-15 and delta C-13
   values, indicating a long-term diet subsidised by marine-derived
   nutrients and energy from pink salmon eggs. Hence, our study provides
   novel evidence that the eggs of invasive pink salmon may provide an
   energetic, profitable food resource for juvenile native fish. More
   research is needed to understand the broader ecological implications for

   feeding habits of non-native sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus",BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,2012,14,4,779-795,APR,"Sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus was introduced into the Eastern
   Cape Province, South Africa, in 1976 and there are concerns about its
   possible negative impacts on native biota. This study investigated its
   trophic impact by examining its feeding habits. Stomach content and
   stable isotope analyses were compared from three localities-the Great
   Fish River, Sundays River and Glen Melville Dam. Stomach content
   analysis indicated a catholic diet dominated by fish particularly in all
   localities. Spatially, however, the diets revealed differences based on
   the dominance of macrophytes that were only present in the rivers, and
   aquatic invertebrates that appeared more diverse within the Great Fish
   River compared to other localities. By contrast, stable isotopes
   revealed a more generalised feeding pattern with no clear dominance of
   particular prey. Stable isotopes further showed that the catfish was a
   complex predator, with large catfish being top predators whereas smaller
   size groups appeared to feed lower in the food chain. An ontogenetic
   shift in diet was evident, with small fish predominantly consuming
   aquatic invertebrates and shifting towards fish with increasing size.
   High dietary overlap suggests the potential risk associated catfish
   feeding, especially the potential of piscivory by small catfish that are
   more likely to persist in shallow and marginal where endangered
   indigenous minnows occur. The alteration of environmental conditions,
   especially flow by inter-basin water transfer (IBWT) schemes, was
   inferred to have had a probable influence its invasion success.
   Occurrence of other invaders, which was facilitated by the IBWT together
   with the catfish, posits the risk of invasion meltdown within the study

   C<sub>4</sub> grasslands",PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY,2014,399,NA,160-172,APR 1,"Stable isotopes in horse teeth from the North American Great Plains show
   that equids began to incorporate C-4 plants in their diets about 6.5
   million years ago as C-4 grasslands expanded. However, the ecological
   response of many other ungulates to this expansion is poorly documented.
   We use stable carbon isotopes in mammalian tooth enamel to test whether
   other ungulates adapted by incorporating C-4 vegetation in their diets.
   The openness of habitats before the expansion of C-4 grasslands is
   uncertain, with plant phytolith studies suggesting a patchy environment
   with open-habitat grasses and forest, and pollen and macrofloral studies
   suggesting more forested habitats. To address this problem we use a
   model that predicts carbon isotope values for tooth enamel for a variety
   of environments, based on values in modern plants. Carbon and oxygen
   isotopes were analyzed in medium to large herbivores from three late
   Miocene and three Pliocene local faunas comprising a total of 13 and 7
   genera, respectively, and 59 and 42 individuals. Results indicate that
   before the expansion of C-4 grasslands, taxa with high-crowned teeth
   were consuming predominantly C-3 vegetation. In contrast, by the late
   Pliocene most taxa studied were consuming a component of C-4 vegetation
   and only the peccary Platygonus sp. had a pure C-3 diet. C-4 consumption
   increased in the late Pliocene (similar to 3.0 Ma) Big Springs local
   fauna probably in response to increased C-4 biomass. Most landscapes in
   the late Miocene of Nebraska were open, such as woodland-savanna or C-3
   grassland, although low carbon values from the Pratt Slide local fauna
   suggest a denser, presumably forested area. This general pattern
   suggests an expansion of open-habitats no later than 12 Ma (early
   Clarendonian). Through the Miocene-Pliocene transition there was an
   overall shift to lower delta O-18 enamel values, which parallels the
   long-term decrease in global mean annual temperature inferred from the
   marine record. Our results indicate that major changes in the diets of
   medium and large herbivores broadly corresponded with increased C4
   biomass and cooling climate from the latest Miocene to the late
   Pliocene. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Kita, ZA (Corresponding Author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Earth \& Atmospher Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.

   through Salt Marsh Food Webs",ESTUARIES AND COASTS,2014,37,2,339-353,MAR,"We measured the effects of a plant invasion (Phragmites australis) on
   resident fish (Fundulus heteroclitus) in New England salt marshes by
   assessing diet quality at the food web base and by quantifying the
   importance of primary producers to secondary production using a recently
   developed Bayesian mixing model (Stable Isotope Analysis in R,
   ``SIAR{''}). Spartina alterniflora, the dominant native plant, exhibited
   significantly greater leaf toughness and higher C/N ratios relative to
   P. australis. Benthic microalgae and phytoplankton (as suspended
   particulate matter) exhibited the lowest C/N indicating higher diet
   quality. We conducted a sensitivity analysis in SIAR by modeling F.
   heteroclitus at three separate trophic levels (1.5, 2.0, and 2.5) using
   species-specific discrimination factors to determine basal resource
   contributions. Overall, the best-fitting models include those that
   assume F. heteroclitus resides approximately 2.0 trophic levels above
   primary producers. Using discrimination factors from a range of data
   sources reported in the literature, our analyses revealed that consumers
   rely less on benthic microalgae and phytoplankton in restricted marshes
   (7-23 \% and 11-44 \%, respectively) relative to reference marshes (5-34
   \% and 23-48 \%, respectively), resulting in a shift in diet toward
   invasive plant consumption (0-27 \%). This is likely due to increased P.
   australis cover and marsh surface shading leading to decreased
   microalgal biomass, combined with reduced flooding of the marsh surface
   that favors terrestrial invertebrate assemblages. Restoration decreased
   the quantity of P. australis in the food web (0-15 \%) and increased the
   importance of microalgae (1-30 \%), phytoplankton (19-48 \%), and native

   assumed to be restricted to the Patagonian Shelf and around the
   subtropical convergence. Beaks found in diet samples from black-browed
   albatrosses Thalassarche melanophris during chick rearing initially
   suggested that it may also inhabit Antarctic waters until it was
   appreciated that I. argentinus is used as fishing bait by commercial
   longliners within albatrosses foraging areas. Here, we applied a new
   methodology involving stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta
   N-15) in two regions {[}tip of the rostrum (juvenile) and wing (adult)]
   of lower beaks obtained from diet samples of black-browed albatrosses
   breeding at Bird Island (South Georgia). The aims were to (1) assess if
   I. argentinus could inhabit Antarctic waters somewhere in the life cycle
   (2) determine the trophic ecology of I. argentinus, and (3) discuss
   possible migration patterns of I. argentinus and whether its
   distribution may change in the future. Values of delta C-13 (proxy for
   habitat) were - 18.4 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand and - 17.1 +/- 0.4 parts
   per thousand during the juvenile and adult life stages, respectively,
   indicating a northwards ontogenetic shift, and that this species
   exclusively inhabits waters north of the Antarctic Polar Front. Values
   of delta N-15 was lower in juveniles (+5.9 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand)
   than adults (+8.4 +/- 1.3 parts per thousand), indicating an increase of
   one trophic level throughout the squid's life, suggesting a diet shift
   from zooplankton to fish and squid. Based on predicted effects of
   climate change, the distribution of I. argentinus may become more
   restricted as the northern limit moves southwards because of warming
   ocean temperature.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Article,English,"Queirós, JP (Corresponding Author), Univ Coimbra, Fac Ciencias \& Tecnol, Dept Ciencias Vida, MARE Marine \& Environm Sci Ctr, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal.

Article,Thomas Detmer and William M. {Lewis Jr.},Influences of fish on food web structure and function in mountain lakes,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2019,64,9,1572-1583,SEP,"Introduction of new fish species to lakes that contain fish is known to
   disrupt food webs, but few studies have quantified the effects of
   introduced fish on flow of organic matter and mechanisms governing food
   web structure in historically fishless lakes. Contrasting flow of
   organic matter and food web structure in macroinvertebrate communities
   in lakes with and without fish provides an opportunity to characterise
   resiliency of macroinvertebrate food web function when there are changes
   in community composition and reductions in biomass. Organic matter flow
   and food web structure were characterised in six lakes with and six
   lakes without fish at high elevation in the southern Rocky Mountains of
   Colorado, U.S.A. Carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) were used
   to determine the proportionate contribution of organic matter from
   primary organic matter sources (periphyton, phytoplankton, terrestrial
   plants) to consumers including herbivores and higher trophic levels.
   Contributions of organic matter sources to macroinvertebrates were
   combined with estimates of littoral macroinvertebrate production in
   quantifying the contribution of each primary source to total
   invertebrate production. Although introduced fish altered community
   composition, body size, and biomass, they did not alter contributions of
   the organic matter sources to production of macroinvertebrates. The
   dominant resources contributing to macroinvertebrate production were
   periphyton and phytoplankton, which combined contributed to 80\% of
   macroinvertebrate production. Despite occupying the highest trophic
   position (difference in delta N-15 relative to primary sources), fish
   did not alter trophic structure of littoral macroinvertebrate
   communities in maximum macroinvertebrate trophic position and community
   trophic position. Community trophic position weighted by production for
   macroinvertebrates was related to macroinvertebrate production per unit
   area but was independent of lake area. In lakes with fish, maximum
   macroinvertebrate trophic position was similar to that of lakes without
   fish because large predators (predaceous beetles and dragonflies) were
   replaced by small predators (tanypod chironomids). The present study
   indicates that macroinvertebrate food webs can exhibit resilience to
   introduced or invasive fish even when there are changes in community
   composition and biomass. This suggests that changes in structure (e.g.
   biomass, community composition) associated with introduced or invasive
   species do not necessarily equate to changes in food web function (e.g.
   flow of organic matter, maximum trophic position). Further, the present
   study suggests that although maximum trophic position has been shown to
   increase with lake size for lakes containing fish, the pattern is
   unlikely to extend to lakes without fish. The relationship between lake
   size and maximum trophic position for lakes containing fish may occur
   because fish have expandable niches associated with high motility and
   indeterminate growth, in contrast to macroinvertebrates.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Detmer, T (Corresponding Author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Ctr Limnol, 216 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.

Article,H. L. Mickleburgh,"Dental Wear and Pathology in the Precolonial Caribbean: Evidence for
   Dietary Change in the Ceramic Age",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OSTEOARCHAEOLOGY,2016,26,2,290-302,MAR-APR,"This study investigates temporal changes in dietary practices in the
   Caribbean archipelago during the Ceramic Age (400 BC-AD 1500), through
   analyses of dental wear and pathology. Some previous studies in the
   region have suggested that diet and subsistence practices changed over
   time due to increasing sociopolitical complexity, climate change, or
   adaptation to island environments rich in marine resources. Both
   horticultural/agricultural intensification and increased marine focus of
   the diet over time have been posited, based among other things on faunal
   and botanical remains, and early ethnohistorical accounts. Local and
   micro-regional stable isotope studies of temporal dietary variation have
   found few indications for change over time, and large regional isotope
   studies are still lacking.
   Dentitions from sites throughout the region dating to the Early Ceramic
   Age (400 BC-AD 600/800) and the Late Ceramic Age (AD 600/800-1500) were
   analysed in order to assess temporal differences. Intra-individual rates
   of wear were calculated using the difference in degree of wear between
   the adjacent molars and the two groups were compared with principal axis
   analysis. Caries, antemortem tooth loss, abscesses and dental calculus
   were recorded per individual and per tooth/socket, and population caries
   and antemortem tooth loss rates were assessed and compared by age group,
   tooth class and sex.
   Comparisons between the two occupation periods revealed significant
   differences in the rate of dental wear and pathology, indicating a shift
   in dietary practices over time, coinciding with known social changes.
   The increase in pathology rates suggests a rise in the consumption of
   cariogenic foods or preparation techniques that increase cariogenicity.
   The decrease in rate of wear over time indicates a reduction in
   abrasivity of the diet. Together these data suggest that there was a
   growing focus on refined, cariogenic foods, likely
   horticultural/agricultural produce. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \&

   Asian Carp invasion? Test of the hostile take-over and opportunistic
   dispersal hypotheses",AQUATIC SCIENCES,2017,79,3,631-642,JUL,"Gizzard shad is a dominant planktivore/detritivore in the Wabash River,
   and populations crashed in the early 1990s. Previous work (1974-2008)
   identified a substantial shift in body-size structure and functional
   trait composition in the Wabash River fish assemblage between 1989 and
   1996. Invasive Asian Carp appeared in the Ohio River basin including the
   Wabash River in the 1990s. Our goal was to test for temporal changes in
   assemblage composition and trophic structure relative to the invasion of
   Asian carp from the early 1990s. We hypothesized that establishment of
   Asian Carp was a contributor to the assemblage composition shift, and
   that their presence altered the trophic pathways and food sources of
   native fishes including Gizzard Shad (hostile takeover hypothesis).
   Alternatively, Asian Carp may have found success through capitalizing on
   an empty niche, likely left vacant by the decline in Gizzard Shad, or
   abundance changes in other trophic groups (opportunistic hypothesis). We
   utilized archival fish and mussel collections to test for trophic
   changes in the ecosystem using delta C-13 and delta 15N stable isotope
   analyses. We examined stomach contents of the dominant
   planktivore/detritivore consumer, Gizzard Shad, from archival and recent
   collections to test for changes in the phytoplankton community. Stable
   isotopes indicated a community reliance on other, more deplete, carbon
   sources than indicated by the algae, and a slight increase between the
   delta C-13 time periods. Although all functional feeding groups of
   fishes indicated some reduction in delta N-15, the differences were only
   significant for omnivores, mussels, and planktivore/detritivores.
   Although Asian Carp may have contributed to the collapse of Gizzard Shad
   populations, other stressors were likely more important drivers of their
   decline. This is the first, albeit indirect, evidence of opportunistic
   ``invasion{''} as opposed to the historically presumed hostile takeover

   nearshore fishes",ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,2022,278,NA,NA,NOV 5,"We examined the relative importance of landscape features on estuarine
   fish trophic structure and dependence on terrestrial organic matter
   (OMterr) in four barrier island lagoon systems along the Alaskan
   Beaufort Sea coast. Our study compared two relatively large lagoon
   systems characterized by high river discharge and relatively free ocean
   water exchanges (central region near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska) with two
   highly protected lagoons charac-terized by low river discharge and
   limited exchange with ocean waters (eastern region near Kaktovik,
   Alaska). We hypothesized that freshwater discharge would be a strong
   determinant of food web structure for both resi-dent marine and
   diadromous fishes if more discharge increases availability of OMterr
   relative to lagoons with limited or no river inputs. To consider
   differences in trophic characteristics in fishes between study regions,
   we estimated community-wide measures of trophic structure (hereafter,
   community metrics) and the relative use of OMterr from mixing models
   using stable isotope composition (delta 13C and delta 15N; muscle
   tissue) among 12 species and identified the influences of region and
   body size. Fish captured in lagoons well protected by barrier islands
   had more distinct and diverse isotopic niches relative to those in more
   exposed lagoons based on community metrics. The use of OMterr by
   nearshore fishes in both regions was substantial and was >50\% for
   diadromous species. Between regions, OMterr use differed in 6 of the 8
   species considered but was not consistently higher in one region. The
   relative importance of OMterr varied with fish size in 7 of 10 species
   considered, with more OMterr used by smaller individuals. This work
   highlights the importance of OMterr to Arctic fishes and fisheries, some
   of which are of subsistence importance, even when feeding grounds are
   primarily marine. We propose that land-scape features, particularly
   barrier islands, play an important role in structuring nearshore food
   webs. Barrier islands may provide a previously undocumented ecosystem

   communities, but also may affect biotic interactions by altering the
   availability of basal resources. We analyzed variations in stable
   isotope ratios (15N/14N and 13C/12C) of fertilizers, plants, prey and
   generalist predators in organic and conventional farming systems in a
   long-term agricultural experiment {[}DOK trial (bioDynamic, bioOrganic,
   Konventionell)]. Two basal resources with pronounced differences in
   carbon isotope signatures, wheat litter (C(3) plant) and maize litter
   (C(4) plant), were used to uncover differences in food web properties
   between the two farming systems (conventional versus organic).
   Predators incorporated significantly higher proportions of carbon from
   wheat sources in organically managed fields, suggesting that they were
   more closely linked to wheat-consuming prey in this system. The delta
   15N values of three predaceous species were more than 2 parts per
   thousand greater in summer than in spring.
   The results obtained suggest that generalist predators consumed higher
   proportions of herbivore prey in the organic system and that starvation
   and intraguild predation rates increased in some predator species with
   time.
   Because the effects of farming system and sampling date on predators
   were species-specific, conserving a diverse natural enemy community

   identical, suggesting that macaques foraged in similar habitats during
   both time periods. However, delta(15)N ratios decreased considerably
   over time, suggesting that macaques today feed at a lower trophic level
   than previously. This decline in trophic level may be because of the
   disappearance or decline of other species that compete with macaques for
   fruit. This study highlights the effect of biodiversity loss on

   from fatty acid and stable isotope analyses",LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,2023,NA,NA,NA,2023 AUG 27,"Global warming causes dramatic environmental change to Arctic
   ecosystems. While pelagic primary production is initiated earlier and
   its intensity can be increased due to earlier ice melt and extended
   open-water periods, sea-ice primary production is progressively confined
   on a spatio-temporal scale, leading to unknown consequences for the
   ice-associated (sympagic) food web. Understanding ecological responses
   to changes in the availability and composition of pelagic and sympagic
   food sources is crucial to determine potential changes of food-web
   structure and functioning in Arctic marine communities under
   increasingly ice-free conditions. Focus was placed on the importance of
   suspended particulate organic matter vs. sympagic organic matter for 12
   zooplankton species with different feeding modes covering five taxonomic
   groups (copepods, krill, amphipods, chaetognaths, and appendicularians)
   at two ice-covered, but environmentally different, stations in the
   north-western Barents Sea in August 2019. Contributions of diatom- and
   flagellate-associated fatty acids (FAs) to total lipid content and
   carbon stable isotopic compositions of these FAs were used to
   discriminate food sources and trace flows of organic matter in marine
   food webs. Combination of proportional contributions of FA markers with
   FA isotopic composition indicated that consumers mostly relied, directly
   (herbivorous species), or indirectly (omnivorous and carnivorous
   species), on pelagic diatoms and flagellates, independently of
   environmental conditions at the sampling locations, trophic position,
   and feeding mode. Differences were nevertheless observed between
   species. Contrary to other studies demonstrating a high importance of
   sympagic organic matter for food-web processes, our results highlight
   the complexity and variability of trophic structures and dependencies in

   and success of benthic populations. In deep sea ecosystems,
   hydrodynamics and depth play fundamental roles in determining benthic
   food resources. Recent studies suggest that the Southern Ocean
   sub-Antarctic front is shifting southward, with implications for primary
   production and food availability around the sub-Antarctic Islands
   embedded in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. We used fatty acid (FA)
   and stable isotope (SI) analyses to investigate the trophic pattern of
   benthic invertebrates and suspended particulate matter (SPM) at three
   Depths (shallow: 100 m, middle: 300 m, and deep: 600 m) in three
   hydrographic regions with different flow and productivity regimes around
   the Prince Edward Islands. Both region and depth affected the SI values
   of SPM, while feeding guild was the key factor influencing consumer
   trophic values. Depth affected the delta N-15 of all trophic groups and
   the FA compositions of suspension feeders. Deeper samples had a higher
   delta N-15 and showed a greater proportion of mono- and saturated fatty
   acids, reflecting greater remineralization of SPM and of food reaching
   the seafloor. Region affected the delta C-13 and FA values of SPM,
   suspension feeders and deposit feeder/scavengers, with differences
   between the interisland and open ocean regions. This was probably linked
   to the retention of nutrients and phytoplankton between the islands.
   Critically, the effects of depth and hydrographic region were taxon
   specific, indicating that long-term responses to environmental change

   of an expanding mesocarnivore in the arctic tundra",JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,2011,80,5,1049-1060,SEP,"1. Most studies addressing the causes of the recent increases and
   expansions of mesopredators in many ecosystems have focused on the
   top-down, releasing effect of extinctions of large apex predators.
   However, in the case of the northward expansion of the red fox into the
   arctic tundra, a bottom-up effect of increased resource availability has
   been proposed, an effect that can counteract prey shortage in the low
   phase of the multi-annual rodent cycle. Resource subsidies both with
   marine and with terrestrial origins could potentially be involved.
   2. During different phases of a multi-annual rodent cycle, we
   investigated the seasonal dynamics and spatial pattern of resource use
   by red foxes across a coast to inland low arctic tundra gradient,
   Varanger Peninsula, Norway. We employed two complementary methods of
   diet analyses: stomach contents and stable isotope analysis.
   3. We found that inland red foxes primarily subsisted on reindeer
   carrions during the low phase of a small rodent population cycle.
   Lemmings became the most important food item towards the peak phase of
   the rodent cycle, despite being less abundant than sympatric voles.
   Isotopic signatures of tissue from both predator and prey also revealed
   that red foxes near the coast used marine-derived subsidies in the
   winter, but these allochthonous resources did not spillover to adult
   foxes living beyond 20-25 km from the coast.
   4. Although more needs to be learned about the link between increasing
   primary productivity due to climatic warming and trophic dynamics in
   tundra ecosystems, we suggest that changes in reindeer management
   through a bottom-up effect, at least regionally, may have paved the way
   towards the establishment of a new mesopredator in the tundra biome.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Killengreen, ST (Corresponding Author), Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic \& Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.

   suggested by stable isotope analysis",ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,2016,181,NA,364-374,NOV 5,"Kelp forests provide habitat for diverse and abundant fish assemblages,
   but the extent to which kelp provides a source of energy to fish and
   other predators is unclear. To examine the use of kelp-derived energy by
   fishes we estimated the contribution of kelp- and phytoplankton-derived
   carbon using carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes
   measured in muscle tissue. Benthic-foraging kelp greenling (Hexagrammos
   decagrammus) and pelagic-foraging black rockfish (Sebastes melanops)
   were collected at eight sites spanning similar to 35 to 60 degrees N
   from the California Current (upwelling) to Alaska Coastal Current
   (downwelling) in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Muscle delta C-13 values
   were expected to be higher for fish tissue primarily derived from kelp,
   a benthic macroalgae, and lower for tissue primarily derived from
   phytoplankton, pelagic microalgae. Muscle delta C-13 values were higher
   in benthic-feeding kelp greenling than in pelagic-feeding black rockfish
   at seven of eight sites, indicating more kelp-derived carbon in
   greenling as expected. Estimates of kelp carbon contributions ranged
   from 36 to 89\% in kelp greenling and 32 to 65\% in black rockfish using
   carbon isotope mixing models. Isotopic evidence suggests that these two
   nearshore fishes routinely derive energy from kelp and phytoplankton,
   across coastal up welling and downwelling systems. Thus, the foraging
   mode of nearshore predators has a small influence on their ultimate
   energy source as energy produced by benthic macroalgae and pelagic
   microalgae were incorporated in fish tissue regardless of feeding mode
   and suggest strong and widespread benthic-pelagic coupling. Widespread
   kelp contributions to benthic- and pelagic-feeding fishes suggests that
   kelp energy provides a benefit to nearshore fishes and highlights the
   potential for kelp and fish production to be linked. Published by

   (<i>Chelonia mydas</i>) at Ningaloo Reef",MARINE BIOLOGY,2022,169,6,NA,JUN,"Diet is fundamental to an individual's biology because energy acquired
   from food constrains growth and reproduction, which subsequently
   influences survival. It is, therefore, important to have a strong
   understanding of a population's diet for species of conservation
   concern, such as the green turtle (Chelonia mydas). While the diet of
   adult green turtles is generally characterised as primarily herbivorous,
   growing evidence suggests variation in diet between and within
   populations is prevalent. We use complementary stable isotope analysis
   techniques to elucidate diet variation within a C. mydas population
   (ranging from small juveniles to adults) foraging at Ningaloo Reef in
   Western Australia. Analyses of multiple tissues and samples from ten
   individuals recaptured between 4 months and 4.5 years apart revealed
   that adults showed the highest levels of individual specialisation and
   consistency in diet over time. Analysis of red blood cell delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 values revealed macroalgae is likely the dominant food source
   for all size classes, and sub-adult and adults also ate animals
   (probably jellyfish). Compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino
   acids indicated the main sources of essential amino acids for Ningaloo
   C. mydas were macroalgae or bacteria. Taken together, these results
   suggest C. mydas at Ningaloo conform to the general description of adult
   C. mydas diet as predominantly herbivorous, but diet varies with size
   and between adult individuals. Consideration of within-population diet
   variation will be important for predicting responses to stressors such
   as climate change, that directly affect foraging resources, as fitness
   consequences may vary for individuals with different diets.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",Article,English,"Stubbs, JL (Corresponding Author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.

   benthic invertebrates on the Arctic Chukchi Sea shelf",FOOD WEBS,2021,29,NA,NA,DEC,"Benthic communities play an important role in the nutrient cycling of
   settling organic matter and provide an energy link to higher trophic
   levels. These benthic communities are highly dependent on the food
   sources provided through sinking organic material, with pelagic-benthic
   coupling particularly strong on Arctic shelf systems. Arctic shelves,
   however, are experiencing shifts in the timing of sea ice breakup that
   can have severe implications on the amount and composition of organic
   matter from different primary production sources supplied to the
   benthos. The role of benthic invertebrates in processing organic matter
   is typically classified by feeding types. The goal of this study was to
   evaluate if benthic invertebrate feeding types are a useful concept for
   understanding how organic matter from various biosynthetic sources is
   used by benthic invertebrates across the Arctic Chukchi Sea. We employed
   essential amino acid (EAA) specific stable isotope fingerprinting to
   identify proportional contributions of three EAA sources (from
   bacterial, phytoplankton, and terrestrial production) as a proxy of
   carbon sources to the diets of benthic consumers. When grouped by
   feeding types, the proportional contributions of the three EAA sources
   were similar among suspension, deposit feeders and predators/scavengers.
   Different genera within the same feeding type, however, showed
   significant differences among the EAA sources, indicating that EAA use
   is genus-specific rather than feeding type-specific. We discuss
   characteristics other than feeding mode among genera that could account
   for different EAA use, including mobility, selectivity of available EAA

   These characteristics provide useful additional considerations when
   grouping organisms by feeding types. High proportions of terrestrial EAA
   were found in the majority of benthic genera across all feeding types
   and characteristics in this study, reflecting the high proportions of
   this organic matter source in sediments and confirming that this source
   is being used by benthic consumers in the Arctic. EAA contributions to
   various benthic genera across the Chukchi Sea shelf had only weak
   correlations with environmental variables. While the distinctly
   different uses of different EAA sources by benthic-feeding genera but
   not by feeding types may represent high trophic plasticity in Arctic
   benthic invertebrates, expected climate change-driven shifts in the
   supply of EAA sources to the Chukchi Sea shelf benthos may still have
   implications for the composition of benthic communities and energy flow

   Fishes of Lake Turkana, Kenya",PLOS ONE,2015,10,5,NA,MAY 19,"Background and Trophic Diversity Study
   Lake Turkana is an understudied desert lake shared by Kenya and
   Ethiopia. This system is at the precipice of large-scale changes in
   ecological function due to climate change and economic development along
   its major inflowing river, the Omo River. To anticipate response by the
   fish community to these changes, we quantified trophic diversity for
   seven ecological disparate species (Alestes baremose, Hydrocynus
   forskalli, Labeo horie, Lates niloticus, Oreochromis niloticus,
   Synodontis schall, and Tilapia zillii) using stable isotopes. Based on
   their marked morphological differentiation, we postulated that dietary
   niches of these species would be similar in size but show little
   overlap. The degree of trophic diversity varied greatly among the
   species studied, refuting our hypothesis regarding dietary niche size.
   Oreochromis niloticus and L. niloticus had the highest trophic diversity
   and significantly larger dietary niches than T. zillii, A. baremose and
   H. forskalli. Low overlap among the dietary niches of the seven species,
   with the exception of the synodontid catfish S. schall, is consistent
   with our second hypothesis.
   Predicting Species' Vulnerability
   Breeding vulnerability was highest among those species with the lowest
   trophic diversity. We predict that in suffering two strikes against
   them, A. baremose, H. forskalli, T. zillii, and L. horiewill be most
   affected by the highly altered Lake Turkana ecosystem and that O.
   niloticus, L. niloticus and S. schall will be least affected. Low
   vulnerability among O. niloticus and L. niloticus is promising for the
   future of the lake's fishery, but the third most important fishery
   species (L. horie) will be highly vulnerable to impending ecosystem
   change. T. zillii should be treated as separate from O. niloticus in the
   fishery given higher sensitivity and a different ecological role. We see
   potential for expansion of the fishery for S. schallbut don't recommend
   the development of a fishery for A. baremose and H. forskalli.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Article,English,"Gownaris, NJ (Corresponding Author), SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine \& Atmospher Sci, Inst Ocean Conservat Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.

   flavescens</i> in eastern Lake Michigan and connected drowned river
   mouth lakes",JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH,2020,46,5,1412-1422,OCT,"Understanding stock structure and habitat use is important for
   sustainable fisheries management and conservation of genetic and
   phenotypic diversity. In eastern Lake Michigan, yellow perch Perca
   flavescens is found in both the nearshore region of Lake Michigan proper
   and drowned river mouth (DRM) lakes, small estuary-like systems directly
   connected to Lake Michigan. Recent genetic analyses suggest complex
   stock structure between these habitats and the potential migration of
   Lake Michigan yellow perch into the profundal zone of DRM lakes. We
   quantified carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) stable isotope
   ratios of yellow perch otolith cores to index natal origins, and
   measured muscle delta C-13, nitrogen (delta N-15), delta O-18, and
   hydrogen (delta H-2) isotope ratios to reflect recent diet and habitat
   use. Stable isotope ratios of otolith cores and muscle samples support
   the existence of resident populations in nearshore Lake Michigan and DRM
   lakes, as well as Lake Michigan migrants using DRM lakes. Most fish
   caught in DRM lakes that had natal and recent stable isotope values
   similar to Lake Michigan fish were collected during fall in DRM lake
   profundal zones. Comparison of otolith core and muscle stable isotope
   ratios of individual yellow perch suggest that individuals that recently
   migrated to DRM lakes also spent early life in Lake Michigan.
   Differential habitat use patterns of yellow perch in eastern Lake
   Michigan may have important implications for harvest estimates and
   fishing regulations. Migration by Lake Michigan fish into DRM lakes does
   not appear to be related to reproduction, and the underlying benefits of
   these migrations remain unclear. (C) 2020 International Association for

   with surface temperatures projected to increase by 3-5 degrees C

   century. Knowledge of how this will affect biological systems is still
   largely restricted to the lower levels of organization (e.g. species
   range shifts), rather than at the community, food web or ecosystem
   level, where responses cannot be predicted from studying single species
   in isolation. Further, many correlational studies are confounded with
   time and/or space, whereas experiments have been mostly confined to
   laboratory microcosms that cannot capture the true complexity of natural
   ecosystems. We used a `natural experiment' in an attempt to circumvent
   these shortcomings, by characterizing community structure and trophic
   interactions in 15 geothermal Icelandic streams ranging in temperature
   from 5 degrees C to 45 degrees C. Even modest temperature increases had
   dramatic effects across multiple levels of organization, from changes in
   the mean body size of the top predators, to unimodal responses of
   species populations, turnover in community composition, and lengthening
   of food chains. Our results reveal that the rates of warming predicted

   dietary shift in later prehistory (Phase III) points to greater
   investment by Marquesan people towards terrestrial arboriculture and
   animal husbandry, as well as to restriction of fishing practices to
   largely inshore exploitation. These results provide a new line of
   evidence towards interpreting the archaeofaunal record at Hane. Stable

   across natural and anthropogenic landscape gradients in a fjord estuary",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2016,6,22,8159-8173,NOV,"Identifying causes of structural ecosystem shifts often requires
   understanding trophic structure, an important determinant of energy flow
   in ecological communities. In coastal pelagic ecosystems worldwide,
   increasing jellyfish (Cnidaria and Ctenophora) at the expense of small
   fish has been linked to anthropogenic alteration of basal trophic
   pathways. However, this hypothesis remains untested in part because
   baseline description of fish-jellyfish trophic dynamics, and the
   environmental features that influence them are lacking. Using stable
   isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15), we examined
   spatiotemporal patterns of fish and jellyfish trophic structure in
   greater Puget Sound, an urbanizing fjord estuary in the NW United
   States. We quantified niche positions of constituent species, niche
   widths and trophic overlap between fish and jellyfish assemblages, and
   several community-level trophic diversity metrics (resource diversity,
   trophic length, and niche widths) of fish and jellyfish combined. We
   then related assemblage- and community-level measures to landscape
   gradients of terrestrial-marine connectivity and anthropogenic influence
   in adjacent catchments. Relative niche positions among species varied
   considerably and displayed no clear pattern except that fish generally
   had higher delta N-15 and lower delta C-13 relative to jellyfish, which
   resulted in low assemblage-level trophic overlap. Fish assemblages had
   larger niche widths than jellyfish in most cases and, along with whole
   community trophic diversity, exhibited contrasting seasonal patterns
   across oceanographic basins, which was positively correlated to
   landscape variation in terrestrial connectivity. In contrast, jellyfish
   niche widths were unrelated to terrestrial connectivity, but weakly
   negatively correlated to urban land use in adjacent catchments. Our
   results indicate that fish-jellyfish trophic structure is highly
   heterogeneous and that disparate processes may underlie the trophic
   ecology of these taxa; consequently, they may respond divergently to
   environmental change. In addition, spatiotemporal variation in ecosystem
   connectivity, in this case through freshwater influence, may influence
   trophic structure across heterogeneous landscapes.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Naman, SM (Corresponding Author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

   used to characterize the food webs of valuable fish species in three
   coastal lagoons of the Ebro Delta subjected to contrasting salinity
   regimes (polyhaline in the Tancada lagoon, mesohaline in the
   Encanyissada and oligohaline in the Clot lagoon). The delta C-13
   signatures of the entire food-web including primary producers, sediment
   organic matter and consumers showed the most enriched values in the
   Tancada lagoon (from approx. -4.8 parts per thousand in sediments to
   -19.7 parts per thousand in fish) and the most depleted ones in the Clot
   lagoon (from approx. -11.4 parts per thousand in sediments to -25.4
   parts per thousand in fish), consistent with dominant contributions from
   marine and continental sources, respectively. For delta N-15,
   particularly high values were detected in the submersed vegetation (11.3
   +/- 0.3 parts per thousand) together with more enriched sediment values
   at lower salinities (by approx. 2.5 parts per thousand), suggesting that
   historical loadings of agricultural fertilizers are still retained by
   the systems and transmitted across trophic levels. Negative
   relationships between delta N-15 and salinity were also observed for the
   amphipod Gammanis aequicauda and the isopod Sphaeroma hookeri,
   suggesting some consumption of accumulated and resuspended detrital
   material. In contrast, delta N-15 signatures of fish showed lower values
   and inconsistent patterns, possibly because most species have a seasonal
   use of the lagoons. The biomass of fish species did not show a clear
   effect of the salinity regime (except for the mosquitofish Gambusia
   holbrookii), but results for mixing models suggest a diet shift from
   higher contribution of zooplankton size fractions in the Encanyissada
   (from 57 to 73\%) to macrofauna at the other lagoons (from 40 to 67\%).
   We suggest that alterations in salinity might modify the trophic
   dynamics of the systems from benthic to planktonic pathways, without
   large-scale differences in delta N-15 of fish suggestive of similar
   trophic levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Prado, P (Corresponding Author), IRTA Aquat Ecosyst, Ctra Poble Nou Km 5-5, San Carlos de la Rapita 43540, Catalonia, Spain.

   organic matter reaching the seafloor will likely affect benthic food web
   function. We used biomass-weighted diversity measures based on trophic
   traits (those related to feeding behaviours, e.g., mobility, size, food
   source), stable isotope ratios (delta N-15 and delta C-13), and taxonomy
   to assess linkages between benthic food web structure and indicators of
   food supply in the shelf and slope ecosystems of the Canadian Beaufort
   Sea and Amundsen Gulf (down to 500 m). Benthic communities across both
   regions used a similar diversity of sedimentary organic matter sources
   according to stable isotopes, despite known differences between regions
   in organic matter input and benthicpelagic coupling. Shelf-edge and
   upper-slope communities exhibited relatively high trophic trait
   diversity, which likely reflected the exploitation of pulsed food inputs
   associated with dynamic processes at the shelf break that affect the
   production and advection of organic matter to the benthos. Pairwise
   relationships between trophic traits and sedimentary proxies of benthic
   food supply were not significant at the regional scale. However, cluster
   analyses supported the notion that trophic trait composition was
   influenced by proximity to the shelf edge, where food supply is
   influenced by episodic events that may not be reflected by in situ
   sedimentary proxies. Our findings add to growing evidence that
   evaluating trophic traits composition may provide more information
   regarding functional responses to changes in benthic food supply than
   either isotopic or taxonomic diversity indices alone.",CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",Article,English,"Ehrman, AD (Corresponding Author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Biol, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.

   resources, food web structure (determined by delta C-13 and delta N-15)
   and relative contributions of autochthonous and allochthonous
   particulate carbon to aquatic consumers in the Irtysh River, which spans
   from northwest China to Kazakhstan and suffers from a long frozen
   period. Despite higher density and biomass, epilithic algae did not make
   large contributions to aquatic consumers due to the restriction of flow
   velocity, water depth and turbidity. Aquatic invertebrates specialized
   in utilization of terrestrial carbon sources, whereas fish varied from
   aquatic to riparian plants. Different resource use of aquatic consumers
   across the three reaches in the Irtysh River was ascribed to the spatial
   distribution of species and resource availability determined by
   flooding, flood scouring and dam construction. The trophic positions and
   food chain length at the upper reach were higher than those at the
   middle and lower reaches. These findings suggest that allochthonous
   carbon had an advantage over autochthonous carbon in supporting aquatic

   invasive species, and understanding the ecological consequences of
   management efforts is an important goal. A non-native strain of
   Phragmites australis (Common Reed; hereafter Phragmites) is aggressively
   invading North American wetlands, and the species has been shown to
   alter hydrology and impact aquatic organisms. Clear Creek Wildlife
   Management Area, in Kentucky, is heavily impacted by Phragmites
   invasion. Portions of the Wildlife Management Area with Phragmites were
   treated with herbicide to restore wetland flora, and in this study, we
   evaluated the effects of both the presence and management of Phragmites
   on wildlife populations and ecosystem function. We selected 3 locations
   (treated Phragmites, untreated Phragmites, and Phragmites-free) and
   surveyed each for water chemistry, wildlife populations, and
   stable-isotope signatures over a 2-y period. Water chemistry varied with
   the presence or absence of Phragmites, suggesting differences in
   nutrient cycling. Fish diversity did not differ among sites, but
   individual species varied in distribution and abundance between the
   Phragmites sites and the Phragmites-free site. Turtles showed
   significant differences in both diversity and body size based on the
   presence or absence of Phragmites, but not herbicide treatment. We
   detected no significant differences in frog diversity across treatments.
   We recorded 8 Kentucky Species of Greatest Conservation Need, but there
   were few differences in the distribution of these species across sites.
   Stable-isotope analysis revealed variation in food-web structure based
   on the presence of Phragmites. These results indicate that herbicides
   had little effect on fish and herpetofaunal communities in the short
   term, but potentially significant ecological changes may occur if
   Phragmites were eradicated. Our conclusions highlight the importance of
   monitoring habitat restoration to guide future management. A holistic,
   ecosystem-level approach is necessary to understand the impacts of both
   invasive species and their management.",HUMBOLDT FIELD RESEARCH INST,"PO BOX 9, STEUBEN, ME 04680-0009 USA",Article,English,"Krzton-Presson, A (Corresponding Author), Murray State Univ, Watershed Studies Inst, Murray, KY 42071 USA.

   evidence",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2015,60,4,711-723,APR,"The palaeoecological assessment, and the use of stable isotopes of
   carbon in subfossils of herbivores and omnivores, represents a novel
   approach to understand transitions in past food-web structure and the
   dynamics of lake ecosystems in response to natural perturbations and
   human impacts. Combined with records of subfossil assemblages of
   cladocerans and chironomids, it may be possible to decipher whether
   changes are attributable to external forces or internally derived system
   shifts.
   A sediment record taken from the shallow (2.3m depth) Kings Billabong in
   the River Murray floodplain (Australia) was analysed to explore changes
   in trophic dynamics over the past century.
   The palaeoecological assessment revealed that littoral assemblages of
   cladocerans and benthic diatoms were gradually replaced by planktonic
   (planktonic and facultative planktonic) assemblages after river
   regulation in the 1920s.
   The stable isotopic composition of carbon (C-13), derived from
   chironomid head capsules, was relatively constant down-core, ranging
   between -26.1 and -24.0, and coincided largely with the C-13 of bulk
   sediment samples (-25.6 parts per thousand to -22.0 parts per thousand).
   The C-13 values of pelagic (Daphnia) and ubiquitous (Bosmina, Alona)
   cladocerans, however, varied markedly, with that for Daphnia between
   -29.8 parts per thousand (10-20cm) and -23.2 parts per thousand
   (60-70cm), and for ubiquitous cladocerans, between -29.4 parts per
   thousand (20-30cm) and -24.5 parts per thousand (80-70cm).
   The temporal changes in the C-13 values of cladocerans also suggest a
   gradual transition from a macrophyte-dominated state to a
   phytoplankton-dominated state after river regulation and further
   indicate changes in the horizontal migration behaviour of Daphnia
   depending on macrophyte abundance and predation risk.
   Our study demonstrates the potential of reconstructing, more precisely,
   the trophic dynamics of large river floodplain lakes and their
   ecological resilience by combining subfossil analyses with stable
   isotope analyses of selected subfossil groups.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Kattel, G (Corresponding Author), Federat Univ Australia, Collaborat Res Network, Ballarat, Vic 3350, Australia.

   attributed to altered geographic landscapes and the eastward expansion
   of the coyote. To investigate effects of habitat use and competition
   with coyotes on diets of foxes in intensively farmed landscapes of
   Illinois, we analyzed carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (delta(13)C and
   delta(15)N) of foxes, coyotes (Canis latrans), and other local species.
   Foxes were categorized as rural (agricultural habitat, coyotes present),
   urban (urban habitat, coyotes absent), or from an agricultural research
   facility at the University of Illinois (South Farms, agricultural
   habitat, coyotes absent). Rural foxes had higher fur isotopic values
   (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) than rural coyotes, indicating that coyotes
   caused foxes to consume prey items from higher trophic levels and eat
   more C-4 plants. Urban foxes had lower isotopic values (delta(13)C and
   delta(15)N) than South Farms foxes, suggesting that habitat use partly
   determined fox diets; foxes in urbanized habitats consumed prey at lower
   trophic levels within a largely C-3 plant based food web. Models of
   competitive exclusion by coyotes were better predictors of fox long-term
   diets, including pup rearing, while habitat use models predicted fox
   diets on a narrower timescale. Competitive exclusion by coyotes might be
   an important factor explaining the decline of foxes in the intense

   acquired from their prey that reflect both the species consumed and the
   regions from which the prey were taken. These chemical tracers-stable
   isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen; persistent organic pollutant
   (POP) concentrations, patterns and ratios; and fatty acid profiles-were
   measured in blubber biopsy samples from North Pacific killer whales
   (Orcinus orca) (n = 84) and were used to provide further insight into
   their diet., particularly for the offshore group, about which little
   dietary information is available. The offshore killer whales were shown
   to consume prey species that were distinctly different from those of
   sympatric resident and transient killer whales. In addition, it was
   confirmed that the offshores forage as far south as California. Thus,
   these results provide evidence that the offshores belong to a third
   killer whale ecotype. Resident killer whale populations showed a
   gradient in stable isotope profiles from west (central Aleutians) to
   cast (Gulf of Alaska) that, in part, can be attributed to a shift from
   off-shelf to continental shelf-based prey. Finally, stable isotope ratio
   results, supported by field observations, showed that the diet in spring
   and summer of eastern Aleutian Island transient killer whales is

   composition, phenology, and primary productivity, potentially altering
   trophic dynamics in Arctic marine ecosystems. As one of the Arctic's top
   predators and a species dependent on sea ice habitat for survival, polar
   bears Ursus maritimus are at risk of habitat loss from sea ice declines,
   and therefore have been used to monitor the effects of climate change in
   the Arctic. We used stable isotope (delta N-15, delta C-1(3)) values of
   806 hair samples collected from Western Hudson Bay (WH) polar bears from
   1993-1994 and 2004-2016 to examine variations in isotopic niche size and
   diet within the population, patterns in foraging ecology over time, and
   the relationship between hair isotopic values and sea ice dynamics. We
   found significant variation in isotopic values between age- and
   sex-classes. Adult males had the highest delta N-15 and delta C-1(3)
   values and the largest isotopic niches, reflecting broader diets. In
   contrast, adult females (with and without cubs) and subadults differed
   isotopically from adult males, and their relatively smaller isotopic
   niches potentially make them more vulnerable to habitat change.
   Population delta C-1(5) values significantly increased over time from
   1993 (mean +/- SD: 18.8 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand) to 2016 (19.5 +/-
   0.7 parts per thousand), while delta C-1(3) values significantly
   decreased from 1993 (-16.2 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand) until 2011 (-17.7
   +/- 0.2 parts per thousand) before increasing until 2016 (-17.0 +/- 0.3
   parts per thousand). Values of delta C-1(3) were significantly
   correlated with length of the open-water period, suggesting that this
   apex predator's foraging ecology was affected by climate change. We
   suggest that WH polar bears may have undergone a significant dietary
   niche shift and/or that the baseline isotopic values in this ecosystem
   may have changed over the last 25 yr in response to climate change.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",Article,English,"Johnson, AC (Corresponding Author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.

   islands: What, where and when to sample",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,2022,143,NA,NA,OCT,"Invasive mammal eradications are widely used for managing island
   ecosystems. However, tracking the outcomes of such large-scale, whole
   ecosystem projects is challenging and costly, and monitoring all
   components of an ecosystem is near impossible. Instead, indicators of
   ecosystem change may provide more practical and integrated measures of
   ecosystem response to eradications. As high-order marine predators,
   seabirds subsidise island eco- systems with nutrients isotopically
   enriched in nitrogen. Invasive mammals have caused a global decline of
   seabirds on islands, reducing this nutrient subsidisation. Following
   eradications, nitrogen stable isotope analysis may provide a useful and
   resource-efficient indicator of ecosystem functional change on
   eradicated islands. However, isotope ratios are affected by a myriad of
   factors, with potential sources of variation being introduced by spatial
   and temporal variation in sampling, and within and between different
   taxa and ecosystem components. To correctly attribute isotopic change to
   post-eradication ecosystem function change, these confounding variables
   need to be understood. To address this need, we analysed stable isotopes
   of nitrogen in soil, plant, spider, and seabird guano samples collected
   at different distances from seabird colonies and at different stages of
   the short-tailed shearwater breeding cycle on six island sites around
   south-eastern Tasmania, Australia. Across these cool, temperate islands
   we detected no temporal variability in delta N-15 throughout the
   breeding season. However, there was notable spatial variability in delta
   N-15 values. The effects of seabird-derived nutrient subsidisation were
   highly localised with high delta N-15 values found inside seabird
   colonies and then rapidly decreasing from the colony boundary. Higher
   delta N-15 values also occurred in areas of higher burrow density within
   a colony. Variability in delta N-15 values also existed both within and
   between ecosystem components. Our results highlight the importance of
   context dependency when using ecological indicators and have important
   implications for the design, implementation and interpretation of
   studies employing stable isotopes as indicators for ecosystem change. We
   pro- vide recommendations for designing future stable isotope studies on
   seabird islands.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Pascoe, P (Corresponding Author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine \& Antarctic Studies, 20 Castray Esplanade, Battery Point, Tas 7004, Australia.

   experiments, we determined the growth of juveniles by feeding juveniles
   with different natural food sources. Growth was supported by natural
   biofilm, dreissenid biodeposited material and an algal suspension.
   Stomach analyses showed clearly that L. benedeni fed on small particles
   of both benthic and pelagic origin and fed by both filtering and
   grazing. Absence of high numbers of animal structures in the stomachs
   and SIA supported the lack of predatory impact in the field, but the

   aquatic ecosystems by altering species richness, diversity and trophic
   structure. To investigate the effects of a bleached kraft pulp mill
   effluent (PME) and municipal sewage treatment plant (STP) discharge on
   fish assemblages in a temperate reservoir, we combined standard
   ecological methodologies with stable isotope analysis of d13C and d15N.
   Total catch, species richness, diversity and coefficient of community
   loss indicated lower species richness and diversity at sites exposed to
   PME, whereas sewage-exposed assemblages had intermediate richness and
   diversity relative to reference sites. Stable isotope analysis of d13C
   and d15N revealed that many species fed at higher relative trophic
   positions in the presence of both effluents and showed shifts towards
   increased reliance on littoral-derived and benthic-derived carbon at
   sites downstream of the PME discharge. Fishes at PME-influenced sites
   had also generally higher condition factor whereas fishes at
   STP-influenced sites were more variable in condition factor. These
   differences may, in part, be due to decreased species diversity at these
   sites and to nutrient enrichment manifest from the effluent discharge.
   While standard fisheries and ecological methodologies and stable isotope
   analysis have been separately used in other studies of anthropogenic
   effects on fishes, their integration in this study provides greater
   resolution than either could alone. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \&

   analysis of human bones from the Dabaoshan cemetery, Helingeer County",SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES,2018,61,2,205-214,FEB,"Central-south Inner Mongolia, China, is highly sensitive to the cultural
   interactions between sedentary agriculturalists and nomadic pastoralists
   during the Eastern Zhou Period (770-256 BC). The previous pattern of
   multiple cultures and diverse ethnic groups has been transformed to the
   increasingly dominated cultural system of Central Plain since the middle
   and late Warring States Period, when the states of Zhao and Qin have
   conquered the most parts of central-south Inner Mongolia. However, the
   variation of subsistence strategies during this historical process has
   never been evaluated. Particularly, as the typical representative of
   Central Plain cultures, the effect of intensive millet agriculture is
   still unknown in the process of population integration and culture
   interaction. Thus, to explore the shift of subsistence pattern, carbon
   and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of bone collagen from Dabaoshan
   site (410-180 BC) have been performed. The isotopic result indicates a
   large amount of C4-based animal protein consumed by Dabaoshan humans.
   According to the archaeological backgrounds, we propose the Dabaoshan
   persons intensively relied on the millet agriculture and developed the
   agro-pastoral economy, which hinted the comprehensive influences from
   Central plain civilizations in late Warring States Period. Further
   compared with other published isotopic data in the same region during
   different periods, we suggest the millet agriculture has played the

   trophic niche? A whole-lake manipulation study",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,2021,787,NA,NA,SEP 15,"Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are a potential driver of
   human-induced global change and interactions occurring among GMOs and
   non-GMOs have important implications for ecosystem structure and
   functioning. Genetically modified fish (transgenic fish) can improve the
   production and characteristics of conventional fish strains currently
   exploited in aquaculture, but their ecological impacts on local food web
   remain less studied. We settled ``all-fish{''} growth hormone
   gene-transgenic and non-transgenic common carp (carp(T) and carp(NT))
   sympatrically in an artificial lake, and used stable isotope analysis to
   test the hypothesis that carp(T) and carp(NT) alter their trophic niche
   to facilitate coexistence through local niche partitioning. A general
   paradigm for coexistence of carp(NT) and carp(T) in this study was that
   carp(NT) increased the use of low-quality food resources (such as
   submerged plants) to mitigate the competition for limited resources
   (i.e., zoobenthos) resulting from niche partitioning. This change
   resulted in an enlarged niche width of carp(NT) and increased the niche
   overlap with its sympatric competitor, that is, carp(T), which led to an
   increase in the individual specialization within the population to
   enhance resource use efficiency. This study represents the first
   controlled empirical test of the trophic interactions between
   competitive coexisting transgenic and non-transgenic organisms at
   population and individual levels. Our results indicate that competitive
   niche partitioning operating between carp(NT) and carp(T) shifts through
   time, emphasizing the importance of changing interspecific interactions

   disturbance",PLOS ONE,2017,12,12,NA,DEC 14,"Mesofauna taxa fill key trophic positions in soil food webs, even in
   terrestrial-marine boundary habitats characterized by frequent natural
   disturbances. Salt marshes represent such boundary habitats,
   characterized by frequent inundations increasing from the terrestrial
   upper to the marine pioneer zone. Despite the high abundance of soil
   mesofauna in salt marshes and their important function by facilitating
   energy and carbon flows, the structure, trophic ecology and
   habitat-related diet shifts of mesofauna species in natural salt marsh
   habitats is virtually unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effects of
   natural disturbance (inundation frequency) on community structure, food
   web complexity and resource use of soil mesofauna using stable isotope
   analysis (N-15, C-13) in three salt marsh zones. In this intertidal
   habitat, the pioneer zone is exposed to inundations twice a day, but
   lower and upper salt marshes are less frequently inundated based on
   shore height. The mesofauna comprised 86 species / taxa dominated by
   Collembola, Oribatida and Mesostigmata. Shifts in environmental
   disturbances influenced the structure of food webs, diversity and
   density declined strongly from the land to the sea pointing to the
   importance of increasing levels of inundation frequency. Accordingly,
   the reduced diversity and density was associated by a simplification of
   the food web in the pioneer zone as compared to the less inundated lower
   and upper salt marsh with a higher number of trophic levels. Strong
   variations in delta N-15 signatures demonstrated that mesofauna species
   are feeding at multiple trophic levels. Primary decomposers were low and
   most mesofauna species functioned as secondary decomposers or predators
   including second order predators or scavengers. The results document
   that major decomposer taxa, such as Collembola and Oribatida, are more
   diverse than previously assumed and predominantly dwell on autochthonous
   resources of the respective salt marsh zone. The results further suggest
   that Mesostigmata mostly adopt an intraguild predation lifestyle. The
   high trophic position of a large number of predators suggests that
   intraguild predation is of significant importance in salt marsh food
   webs. Presumably, intraguild predation contributes to stabilizing the
   salt marsh food web against disturbances.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Article,English,"Haynert, K (Corresponding Author), Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool \& Anthropol, Gottingen, Germany.

   algal and phytoplankton bloom dynamics and the vertical transport of

   whether the contribution of sea ice-derived carbon to benthic fauna and

   receding sea ice. We combined compound-specific stable isotope analysis
   of amino acids with highly branched isoprenoid diatom lipid biomarkers

   examine temporal trends of sea ice-derived carbon, nitrogen isotope

   mid-latitudes in the Canadian Arctic. Associated with an 18\% sea ice
   decline in the mid-Arctic, sea ice-derived carbon contribution to
   Atlantic walrus decreased by 75\% suggesting a strong decoupling of sea
   ice-benthic habitats. By contrast, a nearly exclusive amount of sea
   ice-derived carbon was maintained in high-Arctic Atlantic walrus (98\%
   in 1996 and 89\% in 2006) despite a similar percentage in sea ice
   reduction. Nitrogen isotope baseline or the trophic position of Atlantic
   walrus did not change over time at either location. These findings

   macroinvertebrates are robust indicators of aquatic ecosystem
   interactions. They provide information regarding organic matter
   processing, habitat condition and trophic dynamics. In tropical rivers
   with pronounced wet and dry seasons, macroinvertebrate based ecological
   monitoring tools are explicitly focused on metrics and indices, while
   ignoring interactions of FFG5. Therefore, the objective of this study
   was to investigate the functional feeding type metrics, diversity
   indices and feeding interactions among FFG5 of macroinvertebrates along
   the water pollution gradient in Gilgel Gibe watershed, Ethiopia. Water
   quality parameters and macroinvertebrate community attributes were
   assessed for samples collected from upstream sites (15 sites),
   urban-impacted stretches (12 sites) and wetland-affected river zones (7
   sites) of the watershed during the rainy (July) and dry (February)
   seasons. To understand the effect of pollution on the feeding
   interactions, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were analyzed.
   Macroinvertebrate-based diversity indices and functional feeding type
   metric showed deterioration of ecological integrity at the
   urban-impacted sites and substantial recovery in the wetland-affected
   downstream sites. Omnivorous feeding behavior of macroinvertebrates was
   noted for the upstream sites, whereas clear trophic guilds of FFG5 were
   suggested for the wetland-affected river zones by the stable isotope
   results. The results of pollution gradient analysis and feeding
   interactions among FFGs revealed that the urban-impacted sites showed
   weaker interactions when compared to upstream and wetland influenced
   sites. This affirms the potential importance of feeding interactions
   among FFGs of macroinvertebrates in water quality monitoring. (C) 2016

   stable carbon isotope studies",OECOLOGIA,2005,146,1,148-156,NOV,"Increased use of stable isotope analysis to examine food-web dynamics,
   migration, transfer of nutrients, and behavior will likely result in
   expansion of stable isotope studies investigating human-induced global
   changes. Recent elevation of atmospheric CO2 concentration, related
   primarily to fossil fuel combustion, has reduced atmospheric CO2 delta
   C-13 (C-13/C-12), and this change in isotopic baseline has, in turn,
   reduced plant and animal tissue delta C-13 of terrestrial and aquatic
   organisms. Such depletion in CO2 delta C-13 and its effects on tissue
   delta C-13 may introduce bias into delta C-13 investigations, and if
   this variation is not controlled, may confound interpretation of results
   obtained from tissue samples collected over a temporal span. To control
   for this source of variation, we used a high-precision record of
   atmospheric CO2 delta C-13 from ice cores and direct atmospheric
   measurements to model modern change in CO2 delta C-13. From this model,
   we estimated a correction factor that controls for atmospheric change;
   this correction reduces bias associated with changes in atmospheric
   isotopic baseline and facilitates comparison of tissue delta C-13
   collected over multiple years. To exemplify the importance of accounting
   for atmospheric CO2 delta C-13 depletion, we applied the correction to a
   dataset of collagen delta C-13 obtained from mountain lion (Puma
   concolor) bone samples collected in California between 1893 and 1995.
   Before correction, in three of four ecoregions collagen delta C-13
   decreased significantly concurrent with depletion of atmospheric CO2
   delta C-13 (n >= 32, P <= 0.01). Application of the correction to
   collagen delta C-13 data removed trends from regions demonstrating
   significant declines, and measurement error associated with the
   correction did not add substantial variation to adjusted estimates.

   our understanding of the ecology of Newfoundland herring and its
   vulnerability to climate change by identifying key prey items and
   describing adult herring feeding strategies. We compared plankton
   assemblages to stomach content and stable isotope analyses from herring
   collected in Trinity Bay, Newfoundland, in late summer and autumn
   2017-2019. Six distinct zooplankton communities were identified across
   all years, with a shift in community structure in September 2018. This
   shift coincided with a change from fresher, warmer waters (12-17 \&
   nbsp;C) to more saline, cooler waters (10.5 \& nbsp;C). The most
   frequently consumed prey items were amphipods (Themisto spp.) and
   calanoid copepods (primarily Calanus and Temora spp.). Fish eggs,
   larvae, and juveniles, primarily identified as capelin, were observed in
   stomach contents in all years. Fish contributed most to diets in 2017,
   which corresponded with the peak year for larval densities in Trinity
   Bay, suggesting that piscivory may increase at higher larval densities.
   Herring were opportunistic feeders, although some individuals exhibited
   selective feeding on copepods, amphipods, euphausiids, and the early
   life stages of fishes. Stable isotope analyses supported the finding
   that herring piscivory is prevalent in eastern Newfoundland. Given its

   phocoena has undergone a southward shift in the North Sea, which has led
   to an increase in the number of stranded porpoises in its southern part.
   Since the changes in distribution and relative abundance of porpoises
   may be linked to the changes in prey availability, the aim of the
   present work was to investigate whether any changes in the feeding
   habits of harbour porpoises along the North Sea occurred in the past
   decade. The diet of harbour porpoises stranded along the southern North
   Sea (northern France and Belgian coast) was assessed through 3
   complementary methods: stomach content analysis, stable isotopes (carbon
   and nitrogen) analysis determined from muscle samples, and fatty acids
   analysis determined from blubber samples. Fatty acid patterns and stable
   isotope values from 52 porpoises were compared to 14 potential prey
   species collected from the southern North Sea. Our results showed that
   the diet of porpoises along the southern North Sea comprises fish
   species that are among the most abundant and widely distributed in the
   area, except for the sardine Sardina pilchardus that appeared to be a
   new potential prey. Moreover, our results suggested that the decline in
   sandeel (Ammodytidae) in the northern parts of the North Sea along with
   the re-invasion of the southern North Sea by sardine species might
   affect the distribution of harbour porpoises.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",Article,English,"Mahfouz, C (Corresponding Author), CNRS, Natl Ctr Marine Sci, POB 534, Batroun, Lebanon.

   (Easter Island)",AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,2021,31,"2, SI",304-323,FEB,"The structure of food webs provides important insight into biodiversity,
   organic matter (OM) pathways, and ecosystem functioning.
   Stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15) was used to
   characterize the trophic structure and the main OM pathways supporting
   food webs in the Rapa Nui coastal marine ecosystem.
   The trophic position of consumers and isotopic niche metrics were
   estimated for different assemblages (i.e. mesozooplankton, emergent
   zooplankton, reef invertebrates, reef fishes, pelagic fishes, and
   seabirds). Furthermore, the relative importance of different OM sources
   (i.e. macroalgae, zooxanthellate corals, and particulate OM {[}POM]) was
   assessed for heterotrophic consumers using Bayesian mixing model
   (MixSIAR).
   Results show a clear pattern of C-13 and N-15 enrichment from
   small-sized pelagic and benthic invertebrates, to reef and pelagic
   fishes, and seabirds. Most invertebrates were classified as primary
   consumers, reef fishes as secondary consumers and pelagic predators and
   seabirds as tertiary and quaternary consumers.
   Isotopic niche metrics indicate a low trophic diversity for pelagic
   assemblages (mesozooplankton and pelagic fishes), in contrast to reef
   fauna (invertebrates and fishes), whose higher trophic diversity suggest
   the exploitation of a wider range of trophic resources. Overlapping of
   standard ellipses areas between reef invertebrates and reef fishes
   indicates that both assemblages could be sharing trophic resources.
   Mixing models results indicate that POM is the main trophic pathway for
   mesozooplankton, macroalgae (Rhodophyta) for emergent zooplankton, and a
   mix of coral-derived OM and Rhodophyta for coral reef assemblages such
   as macrobenthos and reef invertebrates. In contrast, POM contribution
   was notably more important for some pelagic fishes and seabirds from
   upper trophic levels.

   reefs, management planning and full-implementation of the recently
   created Rapa Nui Multiple Use Marine Protected Area.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Zapata-Hernández, G (Corresponding Author), Millennium Nucleus Ecol \& Sustainable Management, Coquimbo, Chile.

   Kerguelen Islands (Southern Ocean)",POLAR BIOLOGY,2021,44,4,795-808,APR,"Irregular urchins exclusively live in marine soft bottom habitats,
   dwelling either upon or inside sediments and selectively picking up
   sediment grains and organic particles, or swallowing bulk sediment to
   feed on the associated organic matter. The exact food source and dietary
   requirements of most irregular echinoids, however, remain incompletely
   understood. The schizasterid species Abatus cordatus (Verrill, 1876) is
   a sub-Antarctic spatangoid that is endemic to the Kerguelen. The feeding
   behaviour of A. cordatus was investigated using simultaneously
   metabarcoding and stable isotope approaches. Comparison of ingested and
   surrounding sediments by metabarcoding revealed a limited selective
   ingestion of prokaryotes and eukaryotes by the urchin. Compared to
   surrounding sediments, the gut content had (i) higher carbon and
   nitrogen concentrations potentially due to selective ingestion of
   organic matter and/or the sea urchin mucus secretion and (ii) delta N-15
   enrichment due to the selective assimilation of lighter isotope in the
   gut. Feeding experiments were performed using C-13 and (15) N-enriched
   sediments in aquariums. The progression of stable isotope enrichment in
   proximal and distal parts of the digestive track of A. cordatus revealed
   that all particles are not similarly transported likely due to siphon
   functioning. Ingestion of water with associated dissolved and
   particulate organic matter should play an important role in urchin
   nutrition. A. cordatus had a gut resident time fluctuating between 76
   and 101 h and an ingestion rate of 36 mg dry sediment h(-1) suggesting
   that dense populations of the species may play a key ecological role

   rationale of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture to a broader scale",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,2017,201,NA,82-88,OCT 1,"Pollution is one of the most significant issues that is currently
   impeding the development of fish farming. Integrated multi-trophic
   aquaculture (IMTA) has the potential to reduce the accumulation of
   organic wastes in the environment by using taxa of lower trophic levels
   such as filter feeders. However, the capacity of filter feeders to
   assimilate significant quantities of fish farm wastes has not yet been
   fully tested in situ. We analyzed the stable isotopes delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 in mussels from six fish farms and from six other areas that
   were not influenced by fish farming, at two water strata (surface and
   mid -water) across a marked gradient of eutrophication along more than
   900 km of coastline in the Western Mediterranean. We found that the
   mussels did not directly assimilate fish farming wastes. Consequently,
   fish farming wastes did not constitute a major component of mussel diet,
   irrespective of local productivity and depth in the water column. These
   outcomes do not necessarily mean that IMTA is not suitable in other
   cases, but rather that there should be a shift in the rationale of IMTA
   by modifying the concept of direct assimilation of wastes to a more
   general approach of IMTA based on regional budgets of nutrients. (C)

   The distribution of invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) has been sharply
   expanding throughout all regions of Brazil in the last few years. Here
   we demonstrate that large monocultural plantations provide the primary
   resource subsidies to invasive wild pigs in Brazil. We analyzed 106
   stomach contents and carbon stable isotopes (delta C-13) of 50 hair
   samples of wild pigs from a population inunersed in a landscape
   dominated by sugar cane agriculture. Stomach contents were dominated by
   corn (41\%), sugarcane (28.5\%), vegetal matter (all other vegetation
   besides crops, 27\%), and animal matter (vertebrates and invertebrates,
   4\%). Bayesian mixing model analysis of delta C-13 showed that food
   sources from C-4 photosynthetic pathway (represented by corn and
   sugarcane) accounted for 94\% of the long-term diet, while C-3 food
   sources for only 6.2\%. Our results indicate that corn and sugar cane
   are subsidizing the diet of wild pigs and can facilitate the population
   growth of this invasive species. Given that Brazil is a major

   concerning that extensive agriculture may accelerate the expansion of

   community in a mesocosm test system",SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY,2015,84,NA,127-136,MAY,"We hypothesized that the combined effect of rising levels of atmospheric
   carbon dioxide (CO2) and increasing use of genetically modified (GM)
   crops in agriculture may affect soil food-webs. So we designed a study
   for the assessment of the effects of elevated CO2 (eCO(2))
   concentrations and GM barley on a soil-mesofauna community employing a
   2nd tier mesocosm test system. The GM barley, Hordeum vulgare cv. Golden
   Promise, had a modified content of amino acids and it was compared with
   three non-GM barley cultivated varieties including the isogenic line.
   Our mesocosm experiment was conducted in a greenhouse at ambient
   (aCO(2)) and eCO(2) (+80 ppm) levels and included a multispecies
   assemblage of Collembola, Acari and Enchytraeidae with either a GM or
   conventional spring barley varieties. To detect food-web changes we
   added dried maize leaves naturally enriched in delta C-13 and delta N-15
   relative to the soil substrate. Soil, plants and animals were collected
   after five and eleven weeks. We found that the eCO(2) concentration did
   not affect the plant biomass, but the predatory mite and two collembolan
   species showed significantly lower abundances at eCO(2). The densities
   of three collembolan species (Folsomia fimetaria, Proisotoma minuta and
   juveniles of Mesaphorura macrochaeta) was significantly lower in the GM
   treatment compared to some of the non-GM varieties. F. fimetaria was
   less abundant in presence of GM barley compared to the cultivated barley
   variety ``Netto{''} at both CO2 levels, while the density of P. minuta
   was significantly reduced with the GM barley compared to variety
   ``Netto{''} at aCO(2) and the isogenic variety at eCO(2). Maize litter
   acted as a food source for the community, as it was revealed by delta
   C-13 values in rnicroarthropods. Microarthropod delta C-13 decreased
   over time, which, indicates a diet change of the species towards carbon
   derived from barley, due to maize litter decomposition. The industrially
   produced CO2 gas also had a role as an isotopic marker, as the different
   delta C-13 values were reflected in the barley and in the collembolan
   species. GM barley did not affect delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of
   soil animals indicating that the overall trophic structure of the
   mesofauna community was not changed compared to the non-GM cultivated
   varieties. The mesocosm methodology integrating stable isotope analysis
   demonstrates the potential of the multi-species mesocosm as a tool to
   detect and track changes in the soil trophic interactions in response to
   environmental pressures, climate and novel agricultural crops. (C) 2015

   compositions",QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS,2019,211,NA,136-155,MAY 1,"Environmental change in the Arctic has been a primary topic of interest
   in recent years, particularly as it relates to the consequences of
   anthropogenic climate change. Sea ice is of particular importance in
   this context, both in terms of the effects of climate change in the
   Arctic, but also globally. Most studies examining the responses of
   various components of the biosphere to warming temperatures necessarily
   have a short temporal perspective. The purpose of this study was to use
   stable isotopes to examine long-term variation (c. 4000-500 yr BP) in
   the ecology of a ubiquitous Arctic marine mammal (the ringed seal, Pusa
   hispida) that is intimately linked to sea ice. We present delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 values for ringed seal bone collagen from archaeological
   sites in the central Canadian Arctic Archipelago as well as 61 new AMS
   C-14 dates from these sites. Ringed seal delta C-13 values increased
   between the earliest sites in our study, Early Pre-Dorset (c. 4000 cal
   yr BP), through to the Late Dorset period (c. 800 cal yr BP) suggesting
   increasing primary productivity derived from sea ice relative to
   phytoplankton over this period and an overall cooling trend. Between the
   Late Dorset (1500-700 yr BP) and Thule (c. 700-500 yr BP) periods there
   was an abrupt decline in the contribution of sea ice algae to higher
   trophic levels, consistent with reduced sea ice extent and increased
   open water conditions. These data demonstrate the potential of using
   marine mammals from archaeological sites to reconstruct the changing
   importance of sea ice to food webs over time and offer insight into the
   consequences of climatic variation at higher trophic levels, which is
   difficult if not impossible to obtain with other proxy records. (C) 2019

Smits,Food web structure in oil sands reclaimed wetlands,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,2013,23,5,1048-1060,JUL,"Boreal wetlands play an important role in global carbon balance.
   However, their ecosystem function is threatened by direct anthropogenic
   disturbance and climate change. Oil sands surface mining in the boreal
   regions of Western Canada denudes tracts of land of organic materials,
   leaves large areas in need of reclamation, and generates considerable
   quantities of extraction process-affected materials. Knowledge and
   validation of reclamation techniques that lead to self-sustaining
   wetlands has lagged behind development of protocols for reclaiming
   terrestrial systems. It is important to know whether wetlands reclaimed
   with oil sands process materials can be restored to levels equivalent to
   their original ecosystem function. We approached this question by
   assessing carbon flows and food web structure in naturally formed and
   oil sands-affected wetlands constructed in 1970-2004 in the postmining
   landscape. We evaluated whether a prescribed reclamation strategy,
   involving organic matter amendment, accelerated reclaimed wetland
   development, leading to wetlands that were more similar to their natural
   marsh counterparts than wetlands that were not supplemented with organic
   matter. We measured compartment standing stocks for bacterioplankton,
   microbial biofilm, macrophytes, detritus, and zoobenthos; concentrations
   of dissolved organic carbon and residual naphthenic acids; and microbial
   production, gas fluxes, and aquatic-terrestrial exports (i.e., aquatic
   insect emergence). The total biomass of several biotic compartments
   differed significantly between oil sands and reference wetlands.
   Submerged macrophyte biomass, macroinvertebrate trophic diversity, and
   predator biomass and richness were lower in oil sands-affected wetlands
   than in reference wetlands. There was insufficient evidence to conclude
   that wetland age and wetland amendment with peat-mineral mix mitigate
   effects of oil sands waste materials on the fully aquatic biota.
   Although high variability was observed within most compartments, our
   data show that 20-year-old wetlands containing oil sands material have
   not yet reached the same level of function as their reference
   counterparts.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Kovalenko, KE (Corresponding Author), Univ Windsor, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.

   Middle Nile Valley: A multiproxy investigation of dietary shifts between
   the Neolithic and Kerma periods at Kadruka 1 and Kadruka 21",PLOS ONE,2023,18,2,NA,FEB 2,"Human responses to climate change have long been at the heart of
   discussions of past economic, social, and political change in the Nile
   Valley of northeastern Africa. Following the arrival of Neolithic groups
   in the 6(th) millennium BCE, the Northern Dongola Reach of Upper Nubia
   witnessed a cultural florescence manifested through elaborate funerary
   traditions. However, despite the wealth of archaeological data available
   from funerary contexts, including evidence for domesticated animals and
   plants as grave goods, the paucity of stratified habitation contexts
   hinders interpretation of local subsistence trajectories. While it is
   recognised archaeologically that, against the backdrop of increasing
   environmental deterioration, the importance of agriculture based on
   Southwest Asian winter cereals increased throughout the Kerma period
   (2500-1450 BCE), the contribution of domesticated cereals to earlier
   Neolithic herding economies remains unclear. This paper presents direct
   dietary data from a total of 55 Middle Neolithic and Kerma period
   individuals from Kadruka 21 and Kadruka 1. Microbotanical data obtained
   from human dental calculus and grave sediments are integrated with human
   and faunal stable isotopes to explore changes in dietary breadth over
   time. The combined results demonstrate the consumption of wild plant
   species, including C-4 wetland adapted grasses, by Middle Neolithic
   individuals at Kadruka 1. Despite existing evidence for domesticated
   barley in associated graves, the results obtained in this study provide
   no clear evidence for the routine consumption of domesticated cereals by
   Middle Neolithic individuals. Rather, direct microparticle evidence for
   the consumption of Triticeae cereals is only associated with a single
   Kerma period individual and corresponds with an isotopic shift
   indicating a greater contribution of C-3-derived resources to diet.
   These results provide evidence for Neolithic dietary flexibility in
   Upper Nubia through the persistence of foraging activities and support
   existing evidence linking increased agricultural reliance to the
   development of the Kerma culture.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Article,English,"Le Moyne, C (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.

   foraging in the Canadian eastern Arctic",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,2012,469,NA,161-174,NA,"The eastern Canada-West Greenland (EC-WG) bowhead whale Balaena
   mysticetus population is slowly recovering from the intensive commercial
   whaling of the 18th and 20th centuries. However, climate change, through
   effects on ice conditions and prey availability, is one of several
   threats that might affect bowhead whale recovery. In this study, we
   exploited the variability observed in isotopic signatures of prey
   assemblages across the eastern Arctic to examine variability in diet
   among bowhead whales (n = 202) and identify their potential foraging
   areas. We compared delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotope ratios of biopsied
   skin samples with those of potential zooplankton prey species collected
   across the Canadian eastern Arctic, and calculated the proportional
   contributions of various sources (zooplankton) to the diet of bowhead
   whales using a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model. A cluster analysis
   indicated some variability in isotopic composition among groups of
   individuals, but not between males and females or age classes. The
   isotopic model discounted Davis Strait and Disko Bay as potential
   foraging areas for bowhead whales, at least in spring and summer.
   Lancaster Sound, Baffin Bay and the Gulf of Boothia were the 3 main
   areas likely used for summer feeding, where bowhead whales fed primarily
   on large Arctic calanoid copepods (Calanus hyperboreus, C. glacialis,
   Metridia longa, and Paraeuchaeta spp.), mysids and euphausiids. While
   some inter-individual variability in diet was observed, the strong
   dependence of this endemic Arctic species on Arctic zooplankton may make
   them vulnerable to the predicted latitudinal shift in prey species

   the early medieval (Merovingian, Viking, Early Christian) humans buried
   in the unique Luistari cemetery at Eura (ca. 600-1400 CE), southwestern
   Finland, the largest cemetery of the region. Isotope analysis was
   conducted on 37 humans for dentine and bone collagen (delta C-13, delta
   N-15, and delta S-34), and five of them were also studied using
   compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis. Dental enamel and/or bone
   carbonate delta C-13 values were studied from altogether 65 humans, five
   cattle, and five sheep/goats. The bone and dentine collagen and
   carbonate data show that throughout the centuries, freshwater fish was a
   stable part of the diet for the population. Our results do not show
   systematic dietary differences between estimated males and females, but
   differences can be large on the individual level. We also discovered a
   possible temporal change in the enamel carbonate delta C-13 values that
   could be related to the increasing role of carbohydrates (e.g., crops)
   in the diet. Luistari burials are well comparable to contemporary
   Swedish Viking trading communities like Birka in their higher protein
   intake. But contrary to the wider Viking network, they do not show the

   Chukchi Sea fishes",DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY,2017,135,NA,78-94,JAN,"Climate warming and increasing development are expected to alter the
   ecosystem of the Chukchi Sea, including its fish communities. As a
   component of the Arctic Ecosystem Integrated Survey, we assessed the
   ontogenetic, spatial and temporal variability of the trophic level and
   diet of key fish species in the Chukchi Sea using N and C stable
   isotopes. During August and September of 2012 and 2013,16 common fish
   species and two primary, invertebrate consumers were collected from
   surface, midwater and bottom trawls within the eastern Chukchi Sea.
   Linear mixed-effects models were used to detect possible variation in
   the relationship between body length and either delta C-13 or delta N-15
   values among water masses and years for 13 fish species with an emphasis
   on Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida). We also examined the fish community
   isotopic niche space, trophic redundancy, and trophic separation within
   each water mass as measures of resiliency of the fish food web.
   Ontogenetic shifts in trophic level and diet were observed for most
   species and these changes tended to vary by water mass. As they
   increased in length, most fish species relied more on benthic prey with
   the exception of three forage fish species (walleye pollock, Gadus
   chalcogrammus, capelin, Mallotus villosus, and Pacific sandlance,
   Ammodytes hexapterus). Species that exhibited interannual differences in
   diet and trophic level were feeding at lower trophic levels and consumed
   a more pelagic diet in 2012 when zooplankton densities were higher. Fish
   communities occupied different isotopic niche spaces depending on water
   mass association. In more northerly Arctic waters, the fish community
   occupied the smallest isotopic niche space and relied heavily on a
   limited range of intermediate delta C-13 prey, whereas in warmer,
   nutrient-rich Bering Chukchi Summer Water, pelagic prey was important.
   In the warmest, Pacific-derived coastal water, fish consumed both
   benthic and pelagic prey. Examining how spatial gradients in trophic
   position are linked to environmental drivers can provide insight into
   potential fish community shifts with a changing climate. (C) 2016

   functional roles in the cycling of plant derived carbon through the soil
   food web. For this purpose novel isotope tracer approaches were applied,
   whereby stable isotope (C-13) labelled CO2 was fed to plants and the
   root-released labelled carbon was traced into soil microbial biomarkers.
   We will review the data obtained and show how agricultural practices or

   and organic matter. In this sense, fjord ecosystems are a typical
   interface and buffer zone between freshwater systems, glaciated
   continents, and the coastal ocean. In order to evaluate the potential
   sources and composition of organic matter across fjord ecosystems, we
   characterized particulate organic matter along a lake-river-fjord
   corridor in the Chilean Patagonia using stable isotope (delta C-13) and
   lipid (fatty acid composition) biomarker analyses. Furthermore,
   estimates of zooplankton carbon ingestion rates and measurements of
   delta C-13 and delta N-15 in zooplankton (copepods) were used to
   evaluate the implications of allochthonous subsidies for copepods
   inhabiting inner fjord areas. Our results showed that riverine
   freshwater flows contributed an important amount of dissolved silicon
   but, scarce nitrate and phosphate to the brackish surface layer of the
   fjord ecosystem. Isotopic signatures of particulate organic matter from
   lakes and rivers were distinct from their counterparts in oceanic
   influenced stations. Terrestrial allochthonous sources could support
   around 68-86\% of the particulate organic carbon in the river plume and
   glacier melting areas, whereas fatty acid concentrations were maximal in
   the surface waters of the Pascua and Baker river plumes. Estimates of
   carbon ingestion rates and delta C-13 in copepods from the river plume
   areas indicated that terrestrial carbon could account for a significant
   percentage of the copepod body carbon (20-50\%) during periods of food
   limitation. Particulate organic matter from the Pascua River showed a
   greater allochthonous contribution of terrigenous/vascular plant
   sources. Rivers may provide fjord ecosystems with allochthonous
   contributions from different sources because of the distinct vegetation
   coverage and land use along each river's watershed. These observations
   have significant implications for the management of local riverine areas
   in the context of any human project that may modify terrestrial habitats
   as well as the productivity, food webs, and community structure of
   rivers, lakes, fjords, and the coastal ocean in the Chilean Patagonia.

   system under normal estuarine salinity (<= 35) conditions, but are more
   constrained to Baffin Bay under hypersaline (> 35) conditions. This

   cover on the trophic ecology of a highly threatened fish",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2021,66,1,102-113,JAN,"Understanding risks to aquatic systems posed by changing drought regimes
   is particularly important for the conservation of already threatened
   taxa. However, little is known about how local environmental conditions,
   especially those in heavily human-influenced situations, interact with
   regional shifts such as droughts to alter realised impacts on aquatic
   communities, including threatened top predators. Here, we investigated
   the combined effects of stream drying intensity and riparian canopy
   cover on the trophic interactions of critically endangered kowaro, or
   Canterbury mudfish (Neochanna burrowsius) in an agricultural area of New
   Zealand. Fish populations and their potential prey, both terrestrial and
   aquatic, as well as environmental variables, including riparian canopy
   cover and drying measured with stage loggers, were sampled over eight
   visits to 24 sites spanning orthogonal drying and canopy gradients.
   Stable isotope ratios,C-13/C-12 and(15)N/N-14, were used to investigate
   trophic links between mudfish and their terrestrial and aquatic prey
   across these gradients. When non-native willows (predominantlySalix
   fragilis) dominated the riparian canopy, increased tree cover led to
   elevated drying intensity, probably driven by their relatively high
   water demands compared to other trees. However, in the absence of
   willows, canopy cover had no effect on drying intensity. Although this
   was the only direct link between these two environmental factors, they
   had opposing effects on kowaro populations, which will be important for
   management under drought. Increased drying intensity contributed to
   elevated abundance of microcrustacea and aquatic Diptera larvae, and an
   increase in the relative abundance of kowaro juveniles. However,
   drying-affected kowaro populations also had fewer large reproductive
   adults and elevated delta N-15 values, probably driven by physiological
   limitations and an increase in kowaro cannibalism, respectively. By
   comparison, increased canopy cover enhanced input of terrestrial
   invertebrates, a food resource for larger kowaro, leading to elevated
   kowaro delta C-13 values, no effects on delta N-15 values, and higher
   relative abundance of large kowaro in shaded streams compared to
   unshaded streams. Thus, the riparian canopy cover was able to offset
   some of the effects of drying. Overall, we found no interactions between
   drying intensity and canopy cover affecting kowaro. However, their
   opposing effect highlights the important role local conditions such as
   riparian canopies play on aquatic communities and their potential role
   as a restoration tool to mitigate the effects of large-scale shifts such
   as drought.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Meijer, CG (Corresponding Author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.

   and d13C) in the Elwha River prior to dam removal and salmon
   recolonization",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,2011,27,10,1169-1181,DEC,"Two high-head dams on the Elwha River in Washington State (USA) have
   changed the migratory patterns of resident and anadromous fish, limiting
   Pacific salmon to the lower 7.9km of a river that historically supported
   large Pacific salmon runs. To document the effects of the dams prior to
   their removal, we measured carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of
   primary producers, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish, and water
   chemistry above, between and below the dams. We found that d15N was
   significantly higher in fish, stoneflies, black flies, periphyton and
   macroalgae where salmon still have access. Fish and chloroperlid
   stoneflies were enriched in d13C, but the values were more variable than
   in d15N. For some taxa, there were also differences between the two
   river sections that lack salmon, suggesting that factors other than
   marine-derived nutrients are structuring longitudinal isotopic profiles.
   Consistent with trophic theory, macroalgae had the lowest d15N, followed
   by periphyton, macroinvertebrates and fish, with a range of 6.9, 6.2 and
   7.7 parts per thousand below, between, and above the dams, respectively.
   Water chemistry analyses confirmed earlier reports that the river is
   oligotrophic. Phosphorous levels in the Elwha were lower than those
   found in other regional rivers, with significant differences among
   regulated, unregulated and reference sections. The removal of these
   dams, among the largest of such projects ever attempted, is expected to
   facilitate the return of salmon and their marine-derived nutrients (MDN)
   throughout the watershed, possibly altering the food web structure,
   nutrient levels and stable isotope values that we documented. Published

   INVASIVE PLANKTIVOROUS FISH",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,2008,18,"8, SI",A213-A226,DEC,"The invasion, boom, collapse, and reestablishment of a population of the
   planktivorous threadfin shad in Clear Lake, California, USA, were
   documented over a 20-year period, as were the effects of changing shad
   populations on diet and mercury (Hg) bioaccumulation in nearshore
   fishes. Threadfin shad competitively displaced other planktivorous fish
   in the lake, such as inland silversides, young-of-year (YOY) largemouth
   bass, and YOY bluegill, by reducing zooplankton abundance. As a result,
   all three species shifted from a diet that was dominated by zooplankton
   to one that was almost entirely zoobenthos. Stable carbon isotopes
   corroborated this pattern with each species becoming enriched in delta
   C-13, which is elevated in benthic vs. pelagic organisms. Concomitant
   with these changes, Hg concentrations increased by similar to 50\% in
   all three species. In contrast, obligate benthivores such as prickly
   sculpin showed no relationship between diet or delta C-13 and the
   presence of threadfin shad, suggesting that effects of the shad were not
   strongly linked to the benthic fish community. There were also no
   changes in Hg concentrations of prickly sculpin. The temporary
   extirpation of threadfin shad from the lake resulted in zooplankton
   densities, foraging patterns, isotope ratios, and Hg concentrations in
   pelagic fishes returning to pre-shad values. These results indicate that
   even transient perturbations of the structure of freshwater food webs
   can result in significant alterations in the bioaccumulation of Hg and
   that food webs in lakes can be highly resilient.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Eagles-Smith, CA (Corresponding Author), US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Davis Field Stn, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.

   in bat guano",FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2022,10,NA,NA,SEP 15,"Cave guano deposits represent a relatively untapped paleoecological
   archive that can provide information about past vegetation, climate, and
   bat diet over several millennia. Recent research suggests that carbon
   isotope values (delta C-13) measured in guano accumulations from
   insectivorous bats reflect the relative abundance of C-3 and C-4 plants
   on the landscape while nitrogen isotope values (delta N-15) may reflect
   precipitation amount. Together, these proxies can provide useful
   information for restoration practitioners seeking to understand how
   plant species composition has changed over time in relation to climate
   and land use. To better calibrate these proxies for use in restoration,
   we compared instrumental records of precipitation and satellite imagery
   of vegetation with isotope values measured in modern bat guano from Mary
   Lawson Cave, a large limestone cavern located in central Missouri. Mary
   Lawson Cave hosts a maternity colony of insectivorous gray bats (Myotis
   grisescens), and as such, contains significant guano accumulations. In
   the fall of 2018, we collected a 60 cm long guano core that dates to
   1999 cal AD at its base. Guano core delta C-13 values decrease from the
   base toward the surface (from similar to-26 to -27 parts per thousand)
   whereas delta N-15 values increase toward the surface even after
   accounting for ammonia volatilization (from similar to 3 to 5 parts per
   thousand). Presently, the landscape around Mary Lawson Cave is dominated
   by a deciduous forest and pasture. Given that the land cover has changed
   very little over this period, the decline in delta C-13 values toward
   the present likely reflects a shift in land management on farms and/or
   increases in invasive C-3 species. Rainfall amounts from nearby Lebanon,
   Missouri, are significantly positively correlated with guano delta N-15
   values, a relationship that is notably opposite that observed previously
   in soil and plants. We argue that heavy fertilizer application and
   significant grazing intensity could lead to the accumulation of large
   pools of excess labile nitrogen which would be vulnerable to leaching
   during precipitation events. The relationship between guano delta N-15
   values and precipitation may differ for materials from less
   agriculturally impacted locations or periods and should be extended into
   the past with caution.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Reid, REB (Corresponding Author), Virginia Polytech \& State Univ, Dept Geosci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.

   of terrestrial mammals, allowing for expanded habitat use, increased

   the use of sandy beach resources by the threatened island fox (Urocyon

   surveys of potential prey, beach habitat attributes, and stable isotope
   analysis. Consumption of beach invertebrates, primarily intertidal
   talitrid amphipods (Megalorchestia spp.) by island fox varied with
   abundance of these prey across sites. Distance-based linear modeling
   revealed that abundance of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) wrack,

   variation in talitrid amphipod abundance and biomass across beaches.
   delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of fox whisker (vibrissae) segments
   suggested individualism in diet, with generally low delta C-13 and delta
   N-15 values of some foxes consistent with specializing on primarily
   terrestrial foods, contrasting with the higher isotope values of other
   individuals that suggested a sustained use of sandy beach resources, the
   importance of which varied over time. Abundant allochthonous marine

   Micropterus dolomieu) are important species in the recreational
   fisheries of the Laurentian Great Lakes. The invasion of the Round Goby
   (Neogobius melanostomus) into these lakes has changed several facets of
   black bass biology, but there is still much to learn about the
   relationship between these species. Previous dietary analyses have shown
   Round Goby to be important prey for bass, but have been limited by low
   visual identification rates of dissected stomach items. Within the
   present study, DNA barcoding and stable isotope analysis improve prey
   identification and provide a more quantitative dietary analysis of adult
   black bass in Lake Ontario, comparing the importance of Round Goby as
   prey between these two species. Eighty-four LMB (406mm fork length +/-
   4mm SEM) and two hundred sixty-four SMB (422mm +/- 2mm) obtained as
   tournament mortalities had prey identified using DNA-based methods.
   Round Goby was the most prevalent prey species for both predators. The
   diet of LMB was three times more diverse than that of SMB, which almost
   entirely consists of Round Goby. Our results provide further support
   that recent increases in the size of Lake Ontario bass are a result of
   Round Goby consumption, and that the effects of this dietary shift on
   body condition are greater for SMB. Techniques developed in this study
   include reverse-oriented dual priming oligonucleotides used as blocking

   trophic relationships in two Canadian Arctic Archipelago polynyas",PLOS ONE,2017,12,8,NA,AUG 29,"Climate change driven alterations to patterns of Arctic marine primary
   production, with increasing phytoplankton-and decreasing ice algal
   production, have the potential to change the resource utilisation and
   trophic structure of the benthic communities relying on the algae for
   food. To predict the benthic responses to dietary changes, we studied
   the macroinfaunal community compositions, and used the faunal delta(13)
   C and delta(15) N signatures to investigate their main food sources and
   trophic positions in North Water (NOW) and Lancaster Sound (LS) polynyas
   in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Macroinfaunal density (10 952 ind.
   m(-2)) and biomass (3190 mg C m(-2)) recorded in NOW were higher than
   previously found in the Arctic at depths >500m, and significantly higher
   than in LS (8355 ind. m-2 and 2110 mg C m(-2)). This was attributed to
   higher particulate organic matter fluxes to seafloor in NOW. Polychaetes
   were significant taxa at both sites in terms of density and biomass, and
   in addition crustacean density in NOW and bivalve density in LS were
   high. Facultative filter and surface deposit feeders were highly
   prevalent at both sites, suggesting feeding plasticity is a successful
   strategy for accessing different food sources. The macrofaunal delta(13)
   C signatures reflected the signatures of pelagic particulate organic
   matter at the sites, and an isotope mixing model confirmed phytoplankton
   as the main food source for most taxa and feeding guilds. The food web
   length in LS was longer than in NOW (3.2 vs. 2.8 trophic levels). This
   was attributed to a larger reliance on reworked organic matter by the
   benthic community in LS, whereas the high export fluxes at the highly
   productive NOW resulted in higher rates of selective consumption of
   fresh algal matter. Despite studies suggesting that loss of ice algae
   from consumer diets in the Arctic might have a negative impact on the
   benthos, this study suggests that Arctic macrobenthic communities thrive
   using phytoplankton as their main food source and should thus be able to
   cope or even benefit from predicted changes to patterns of primary

   spectrometry",RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY,2018,32,22,1905-1910,NOV 30,"RationaleMethodsOtoliths are usually used to estimate the age of fish
   and the chemical composition such as nitrogen stable isotope ratios
   (N-15 values) may record environmental information and ecological role
   of the fish. However, the isotopic fractionation of N-15 values between
   diets and otoliths has rarely been investigated and remains unclear.
   Nitrogen isotopic fractionation between five different diets (N-15(diet)
   values) and otoliths (N-15(oto) values) were elucidated in tilapia
   Oreochromis mossambica reared in controlled feeding experiments. The
   otoliths were dissolved with hydrogen chloride and peroxodisulfate was
   used to oxidize the total organic materials to nitrate, which was
   further converted into N2O gas by denitrification bacteria before the
   measurement of N-15(oto) values by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The
   N-15 values of muscles, gills, scales and livers of the tilapias were
   also measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry.
   ResultsConclusionsThe peroxodisulfate oxidation-bacterial conversion
   method reduced the minimum mass of the otoliths required for analysis to
   as low as 2mg, unlike past methods, which have required masses of
   8-155mg. The N-15(oto) values were not significantly different from the
   N-15(diet) values of the five diets. Furthermore, the somatic growth
   rate had no effect on the N-15(oto) values. Nevertheless, the N-15
   values of metabolically active tissues were significantly different from
   each other and higher than the N-15(diet) values, due to the deamination
   of these tissues.
   These results suggest that diet was the main source of amino acids for
   the otolith organic matrix and there was no biochemical transamination
   during the assimilation of dietary amino acids to otoliths. The
   N-15(oto) value can be used as a proxy of nitrogen sources of fishes and
   may have potential application in ecological studies such as the
   detection of diet shift, migration, trophic levels and environmental
   changes experienced by the fish population.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Shiao, JC (Corresponding Author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Coll Sci, 1,Sect 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.

   Iberian Early Neolithic: A stable isotope approach",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2018,167,2,257-271,OCT,"Objectives: The Early Neolithic involved an important social and
   economic shift that can be tested not only with the material culture,
   but also through biomolecular approaches. The Iberian Peninsula presents
   few Early Neolithic sites where fauna and humans can be analyzed
   together from an isotopic perspective. Here we present an isotopic study
   on the site of Cueva de Chaves as an example for understanding the
   dietary and economical changes that took place during Early Neolithic in
   Iberia.
   Material and methods: Here we apply carbon and nitrogen stable isotope
   analysis to bone collagen from 4 humans and 64 faunal samples from 14
   different species. The large dataset belongs to the same unique
   chrono-cultural context secured by 20 radiocarbon dates. Three direct
   new radiocarbon dates were carried out on the human remains analyzed.
   Results: Faunal isotope values show no significant differences between
   wild and domestic herbivores, although the latter have more homogeneous
   values. Domestic pigs, potentially considered omnivorous, also show
   signatures of a herbivore diet. Human isotopic results show a diet
   mainly based on terrestrial C3 resources and possibly high meat
   consumption. The only individual found buried with a special funerary
   treatment presents a slightly different protein intake, when taking into
   account the long contemporaneous baseline analyzed.
   Discussion: Similar values between wild and domestic species could be
   the result of common feeding resources and/or grazing on the same parts
   of the landscape. The herbivore diet seen amongst domestic pigs rules
   out feeding on household leftovers. High meat consumption by humans
   would support the hypothesis of the existence of a specialized animal
   husbandry management community in which agriculture was not intensively
   developed. Our results suggest that the development of agricultural
   practices and animal husbandry were not necessarily associated together
   in the early stages of the Western Mediterranean Neolithic.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Villalba-Mouco, V (Corresponding Author), Univ Zaragoza, Dept Ciencias Antiguedad, Pedro Cerbuna 12, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain.

   scales from 50-yr collections to determine the pattern of change of
   delta C-13 during the eutrophication and reoligotrophication of two
   subalpine lakes: Lakes Constance and Geneva. The isotope composition of
   scales from Lake Annecy, a subalpine lake that has been protected from
   eutrophication, was also determined, to provide a control value for
   modifications in the values of whitefish scale delta C-13 in the absence
   of any significant changes in the trophic status of the lake. In Lakes
   Constance and Geneva, changes in whitefish scales delta C-13 were
   closely correlated with those in the mean annual phosphorus
   concentrations and, to a lesser extent, also reflected the efficiency of
   winter mixing in Lake Geneva. In contrast, in Lake Annecy, whitefish 313
   C exhibited only minor changes during the survey. Changes in whitefish
   scale delta C-13 with the trophic status of Lakes Geneva and Constance
   were not linked to either a shift in whitefish feeding behavior or to
   alterations in the length of the pelagic trophic chain. Hence, the
   pattern of variation of whitefish delta C-13 during the last decades
   mirrored the lakes' trophic history. The responses of the Lakes Geneva
   and Constance to changes in P-tot were strictly synchronous and

   native ecosystems. Insects and other arthropods as one of the major
   components of many ecosystems are very sensitive to subtle changes in
   abiotic and biotic environments. We examined the effects of exotic
   Spartina alterniflora invasion on community structure and diets of
   arthropods in a saltmarsh previously dominated by native Phragmites
   australis in Yangtze River estuary through net sweeping and plant
   harvesting methods and stable isotope analysis. Our results showed that
   diversity indices were not significantly different between exotic and
   native plant communities, but the total abundance of insects estimated
   through plant harvesting method was found to be lower in Spartina
   monoculture than that in Phragmites monoculture. Community structure of
   insects in Spartina monoculture was dissimilar to that in Phragmites
   monoculture and Phragmites-Spartina mixture. Moreover, stable carbon
   isotope patterns of arthropods were significantly different between
   Phragmites and Spartina monocultures. Although some native arthropods
   (perhaps generalists) shifted their diets, many native taxa did prefer
   Phragmites to Spartina even in Spartina monoculture. Spartina invasions
   resulted in reduced abundances of some arthropds, and increased
   dominance of others feeding preferably on Spartina. This study provides
   evidence that invasive plants can change the community structure and
   diets of native arthropods, which will eventually alter the arthropod
   food web, and affect the integrity and functioning of native ecosystems
   within a nature reserve that has been set aside for conserving the
   native biodiversity and maintaining the ecosystem integrity. In this

   tropical elevation gradient",OECOLOGIA,2018,187,3,731-744,JUL,"Food resource availability varies along gradients of elevation where
   riparian vegetative cover exerts control on the relative availability of
   allochthonous and autochthonous resources in streams. Still, little is
   known about how elevation gradients can alter the availability and
   quality of resources and how stream food webs respond. We sampled
   habitat characteristics, stable isotope signatures (delta C-13, delta
   N-15, delta H-2) and the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus composition of
   basal food resources and insects in 11 streams of similar size along an
   elevation gradient from 1260 to 4045 m on the northeastern slope of the
   Ecuadorian Andean-Amazon region. Algal-based (autochthonous) food
   resources primarily supported insects occurring at higher elevations,
   but at low elevations there was a shift to greater allochthony,
   corresponding with lower light availability and reduced epilithon
   resource abundance. Additionally, percent phosphorus (\%P) of both
   autochthonous and allochthonous food resources and of body tissue for
   some abundant insect taxa (stonefly Anacroneuria and mayfly Andesiops)
   declined with increasing elevation, despite the greater autochthony at
   high elevation. Allochthonous food resources were always a lower quality
   food resource, as indicated by higher C:N, N:P, and lower \%P, across
   elevation in comparison to autochthonous resources, but autochthonous
   resources had higher \%P than allochthonous resources across all
   elevations and comprised a greater portion of high-elevation insect
   resource assimilation. Aquatic insects may be able to compensate for the
   lower quality of both resource types at high elevations through altered
   body stoichiometry, even though higher quality autochthonous-based foods
   are in high abundance at high elevations.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Article,English,"Atkinson, CL (Corresponding Author), Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.

   acids (delta 13CAA) to determine organic carbon sources utilized by the
   dominant benthic bivalve species collected along a latitudinal gradient
   in the northern Bering and Chukchi Seas, specifically at productivity
   hotspots identified within the Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO)
   program, and over Hanna Shoal in the northern Chukchi Sea. The recent
   shift to earlier sea-ice melt is one of the climate change consequences
   influencing Pacific Arctic ecosystems, which we integrate within our
   observations. Our goals included investigating the utilization of
   organic matter resources by several dominant Arctic bivalves and their
   trophic elasticity to changes in primary productivity patterns following
   changes in the onset of the annual productive season. Based upon delta
   13CAA patterns observed, these species utilized different carbon sources
   along the latitudinal gradient, including a strong input of bacterially
   reworked material and microalgae, mainly in particulate organic matter
   mixtures. Species type and the sampling location both played roles in
   delta 13CAA variability, suggesting the influence of local production
   and decomposition processes. Macoma calcarea and Ennucula tenuis were
   shown to utilize organic matter of different quality, suggesting they
   may switch their feeding preferences to more detrital sources on a
   seasonal basis, but this was also affected by geographical location.

   the organic matter produced in situ as well as that delivered from the
   landscape and neighboring ecosystems. Disturbances, such as
   eutrophication, and seasonal swings in primary production may influence
   sediment organic matter composition and, as a result, the sources of
   carbon available to bacteria. We evaluated whether bacterial carbon
   sources varied between 2 salt marsh tidal creeks with different water
   column nutrient levels (fertilized versus ambient) and if they changed
   over a growing season through field observations and stable isotope
   labeling experiments. Sediment organic matter composition, determined
   using lipid biomarkers and stable isotopes, was similar between the
   tidal creeks and did not change over time. In the field, isotopic
   analysis (natural abundance delta C-13) of bacterial lipids and
   potential organic matter sources revealed that bacteria assimilated
   carbon from several sources but mainly relied on microalgae. In the
   experiments, C-13 was added to sediment cores from both creeks as sodium
   bicarbonate (June, August, October) or Spartina alterniflora detritus

   similar rates. Further, C-13 from S. alterniflora was rapidly

   enrichment did not affect bacterial carbon sources in the field or
   incorporation of C-13 from BMA and S. alterniflora in the experiments.
   Tight coupling between BMA and bacteria may explain why nitrogen

   Positions of Dominant Zooplankton Groups in Jiaozhou Bay, China",FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,2022,9,NA,NA,JUN 22,"The spatial and seasonal distributions of stable carbon and nitrogen
   isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in dominant zooplankton groups were
   investigated in Jiaozhou Bay. Zooplankton delta C-13 values ranged from
   -22.89 parts per thousand to -15.86 parts per thousand, and delta N-15
   values ranged from 3.18 parts per thousand to 13.57 parts per thousand,
   respectively. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 values generally followed
   the order of small zooplankton < large calanoids < small Sagitta < large
   Sagitta. Spatial distribution patterns of zooplankton delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 values varied in different seasons. Our results suggested
   that the spatial variation of delta C-13 was mainly controlled by
   terrigenous organic matter (OM) input and phytoplankton biomass, but
   water temperature may have played a key role in the seasonal variation
   of delta C-13. In spring, the high phytoplankton biomass might increase
   the delta C-13 value of small zooplankton in the inner bay. During other
   seasons, the delta C-13 values of zooplankton generally increased from
   the inner bay to the outer bay, which might be associated with the
   influence of C-13-depleted terrigenous OM carried by the river
   discharge. Small zooplankton stable isotope values were significantly
   correlated with that of particulate organic matter (POM). The influence
   of anthropogenic nutrient input on isotopic baseline can be cascaded to
   the zooplankton, and the effect might be weak at higher trophic levels.
   The Bayesian standard ellipse areas of dominant zooplankton groups were
   generally smallest in the winter, suggesting a narrow niche width during
   that time. The niche partition between small zooplankton, large
   calanoids, and Sagitta was most distinct in winter, and followed by
   summer. The relative trophic level of Sagitta ranged from 2.23 to 4.01,
   which generally declined from the inner bay to the outer bay during the
   spring, autumn, and winter seasons. High anthropogenic nutrient loading
   might reduce the difference in trophic niches among zooplankton groups.

   mesopredators in the Colombian Caribbean",FOOD WEBS,2023,35,NA,NA,JUN,"The ecological interactions between invasive species and members of the
   invaded community determine the impacts of biological invasions. Severe
   detrimental impacts of the invasive lionfish (Pterois volitans) in the
   Western-Atlantic have been well documented in northern regions of the
   invaded area. Yet, the fundamental nature of lionfish interactions with
   native predators remains unclear and understudied in the Southern
   Carib-bean. Here, we use a series of quantitative tools applied on bulk
   muscle tissue stable isotope data (delta 13C and delta 15N), to compare
   inter and intraspecific isotopic niche metrics, similarity in the use of
   food resources, and the proportional contribution of two primary carbon
   sources to the diet of lionfish and two common ecologically similar
   mesopredators (Cephalopholis cruentata and Lutjanus mahogoni) in Taganga
   Bay (Colombian Caribbean). Limited overlap in the Bayesian standard
   ellipses of native mesopredators and lionfish suggested a substantial
   amount of partitioning in the use of food resources and, therefore,
   little apparent ecological impacts on native mesopredators by lionfish,
   in terms of strict competition for the use of food resources. Native
   mesopredators showed low trophic diversity, and a high degree of trophic
   redundancy (for C. cruentata). In contrast, lionfish had broad trophic
   diversity and high among-individual isotopic variability. This was
   consistent with Bayesian mixing models that revealed differential
   patterns in the importance of primary carbon sources in the diet of
   lionfish compared to native mesopredators. These results imply that
   different resource-consumer dynamics exist between lionfish and native
   mesopredators, despite fulfilling similar functional roles in the food
   web structure of Taganga bay, as indicated by similar Bayesian estimated
   trophic positions. Thus, our study highlights the importance of
   species-specific trophic characteristics in delineating invasive-native
   ecological interactions and constitutes the first study to examine

   Mediterranean have increased exponentially during the last decade. This
   region has a high number of Mesolithic and Neolithic carbon and nitrogen
   isotope ratio data available compared with other world areas, resulting
   from the interest in the ``transition{''} between hunter-gathering and
   farming. This type of analysis is important as one of the few tools that
   give direct information on the poorly understood dietary transition from
   hunter-gatherer to agro-pastoralist subsistence in the Mediterranean
   Basin. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis on bulk collagen are
   especially useful for exploring marine vs. terrestrial protein input and
   therefore assess marine resource exploitation by these two different
   lifestyles. Gathering together all isotopic data for these chronologies
   we show that the Western Mediterranean underwent a unique/distinct
   Neolithisation process. These data show a gradual dietary shift in
   aquatic resource consumption during the transition to farming that
   contrasts to elsewhere in Europe. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All

   inferred from stable isotope and fatty acid analyses",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,2014,500,NA,121-137,NA,"The abyss of the Sea of Japan represents an example of an isolated
   deep-sea environment that contains mostly endemic fauna and has a
   complicated Quaternary history. To determine the trophic structure and
   sources supporting this abyssal benthic community, the carbon and
   nitrogen stable isotope ratios and fatty acid (FA) compositions of key
   invertebrate species and sedimentary organic matter (SOM) were analysed.
   Samples were collected at a range of depths from 2481 to 3666 m in the
   deep-water basin of the Sea of Japan in August 2010. Species of the most
   abundant invertebrates-including polychaetes, sea anemones, peracarid
   crustaceans, bivalves and brittle stars-showed similar delta N-15
   values, corresponding to relatively high and similar trophic positions.
   Analysis of FA trophic markers showed that all of these equally
   N-15-enriched omnivores, carnivores and scavenger species in the Sea of
   Japan abyssal environment fed mostly on sinking zooplankton animals. The
   resulting FA profiles of these species showed a high 18:1 omega 9/18:1
   omega 7 ratio, and the 22:6 omega 3 and 20:5 omega 3 polyunsaturated FAs
   were the most abundant FAs. Only one macrobenthic species, the
   filter-feeding Thyasira (Parathyasira) sp., had low 22:6 omega 3 and
   20:5 omega 3 FA proportions, but it exhibited significant levels of 18:2
   omega 6 and 16:1 omega 10 FAs characteristic of the SOM of the deep
   waters of the Sea of Japan. These data reveal the dominant role of
   descending zooplankton as a food resource for mega- and macrobenthos in
   this marginal deep-water environment. Despite the proximity of the
   productive shelf area, which exports plant residues to the deep-water
   basin of the Sea of Japan, we found no isotopic or FA indications of
   feeding on allochtonous detritus of seagrasses or macroalgae among
   abyssal consumers. Our data did not support cannibalism as a feeding
   mode of the abundant abyssal carnivorous polychaetes, as had previously
   been suggested. Different key invertebrate species of the Sea of Japan
   abyssal food web occupied similar trophic positions and fed
   predominantly on descended zooplankton. We suggest that the simple
   structure of the Sea of Japan abyssal food web, lacking abundant
   deposit-feeder food chains, is the result of the young evolutionary age
   of this community rather than the low availability of bottom detritus or
   the specific structure of the pelagic community that provides abundant
   downward flow of zooplankton.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",Article,English,"Kiyashko, SI (Corresponding Author), Russian Acad Sci, AV Zhirmunsky Inst Marine Biol, Far East Branch, Vladivostok 690059, Russia.

   predator",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,2021,27,5,1052-1067,MAR,"Rapid anthropogenic environmental change is expected to impact a host of
   ecological parameters in Southern Ocean ecosystems. Of critical concern
   are the consequences of these changes on the range of species that show
   fidelity to migratory destinations, as philopatry is hypothesized to
   help or hinder adaptation to climate change depending on the
   circumstances. Many baleen whales show philopatry to feeding grounds and
   are also capital breeders that meet migratory and reproductive costs
   through seasonal energy intake. Southern right whales (Eubalaena
   australis, SRWs) are capital breeders that have a strong relationship
   between reproductive output and foraging success. The population
   dynamics of South Africa's population of SRWs are characterized by two
   distinct periods: the 1990s, a period of high calving rates; and the
   late 2010s, a period associated with lowered calving rates. Here we use
   analyses of stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope
   values from SRW biopsy samples (n = 122) collected during these two
   distinct periods to investigate foraging ecology of the South African
   population of SRWs over a time period coincident with the demographic
   shift. We show that South African SRWs underwent a dramatic northward
   shift, and diversification, in foraging strategy from 1990s to 2010s.
   Bayesian mixing model results suggest that during the 1990s, South
   African SRWs foraged on prey isotopically similar to South Georgia/Islas
   Georgias del Sur krill. In contrast, in the 2010s, South African SRWs
   foraged on prey isotopically consistent with the waters of the
   Subtropical Convergence, Polar Front and Marion Island. We hypothesize
   that this shift represents a response to changes in preferred habitat or
   prey, for example, the decrease in abundance and southward range
   contraction of Antarctic krill. By linking reproductive decline to
   changing foraging strategies for the first time in SRWs, we show that
   altering foraging strategies may not be sufficient to adapt to a
   changing ocean.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Carroll, EL (Corresponding Author), Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand.

   Plateau",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2019,9,14,8119-8132,JUL,"Pteropods are a group of small marine gastropods that are highly
   sensitive to multiple stressors associated with climate change. Their
   trophic ecology is not well studied, with most research having focused
   primarily on the effects of ocean acidification on their fragile,
   aragonite shells. Stable isotopes analysis coupled with isotope-based
   Bayesian niche metrics is useful for characterizing the trophic
   structure of biological assemblages. These approaches have not been
   implemented for pteropod assemblages. We used isotope-based Bayesian
   niche metrics to investigate the trophic relationships of three
   co-occurring pteropod species, with distinct feeding behaviors, sampled
   from the Southern Kerguelen Plateau area in the Indian Sector of the
   Southern Ocean-a biologically and economically important but poorly
   studied region. Two of these species were gymnosomes (shell-less
   pteropods), which are traditionally regarded as specialist predators on
   other pteropods, and the third species was a thecosome (shelled
   pteropod), which are typically generalist omnivores. For each species,
   we aimed to understand (a) variability and overlap among isotopic
   niches; and (b) whether there was a relationship between body size and
   trophic position. Observed isotopic niche areas were broadest for
   gymnosomes, especially Clione limacina antarctica, whose observed
   isotopic niche area was wider than expected on both delta C-13 and delta
   N-15 value axes. We also found that trophic position significantly
   increased with increasing body length for Spongiobranchaea australis. We
   found no indication of a dietary shift toward increased trophic position
   with increasing body size for Clio pyramidata f. sulcata. Trophic
   positions ranged from 2.8 to 3.5, revealing an assemblage composed of
   both primary and secondary consumer behaviors. This study provides a
   comprehensive comparative analysis on trophodynamics in Southern Ocean
   pteropod species, and supports previous studies using gut content, fatty
   acid and stable isotope analyses. Combined, our results illustrate
   differences in intraspecific trophic behavior that may be attributed to
   differential feeding strategies at species level.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Weldrick, CK (Corresponding Author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine \& Antarctic Studies, Locked Bag 129, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.

   fishes? Absence of evidence from Hong Kong streams",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2021,66,9,1751-1764,SEP,"Exotic poeciliids have been reported to reduce abundance and richness of
   native fishes and, more generally, constrain the trophic niches of
   native counterparts. However, understanding of the consequences of
   poeciliids on native fishes in tropical streams is limited. We conducted
   a survey of lowland streams in Hong Kong during 2018-19 to document the
   prevalence of poeciliids and look for signs that they had affected the
   distribution of native fishes. Overall, 31 native and 15 exotic fishes
   were recorded during the survey. Exotics occurred at 37 out of 45 survey
   sites, with poeciliids present at 35 sites. Richness of poeciliids or
   other exotic fishes had no correlation with the number of native species
   at each site. Moreover, native fish assemblages appeared unaffected by
   poeciliids, which might reflect a legacy of stream pollution. By
   comparing nine streams where the presence and composition of poeciliids
   varied, we investigated whether the mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis)
   alone, and in combination with the guppy (Poecilia reticulata),
   swordtail (Xiphophorus hellerii), and variable platy (Xiphophorus
   variatus), affected the trophic niche of native half-banded barb
   (Puntius semifasciolatus: Cyprinidae) which has a similar body size to
   the poeciliids, as quantified by gut content and stable-isotope
   analysis. We also tested whether the trophic niche of the mosquitofish
   was affected by the three other poeciliids. Gut-content analysis
   indicated that the half-handed barb fed on aquatic invertebrates, while
   the mosquitofish ate mainly terrestrial insects. The three other
   poeciliids were predominately primary consumers. The mosquitofish, alone
   or in combination with other poeciliids, had no detectable effects on
   the dietary or isotopic niche of the barb, nor was the niche of the
   mosquitofish influenced by the presence of other poeciliids. Limited
   dietary overlap and differences in microhabitat use were likely to
   account for the absence of a detectable niche shift by the barb where
   poeciliids were present.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Tsang, AHF (Corresponding Author), Univ Hong Kong, Div Ecol \& Biodivers, Sch Biol Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

   to Homo in eastern Africa was linked to the spread of open and arid
   environments near the Plio-Pleistocene boundary, but data for the latest
   Pliocene are scarce. Here we present new stable carbon isotope data from
   the late Pliocene mammalian fauna from Ledi-Geraru, in the lower Awash
   Valley (LAV), Ethiopia, and mammalian community analyses from the LAV
   and Turkana Basin. These data, combined with pedogenic carbonate stable
   isotopes, indicate that the two regions were largely similar through the
   Plio-Pleistocene, but that important environmental differences existed
   during the emergence of Homo around 2.8 million years ago. The
   mid-Pliocene to late Pliocene interval in the LAV was characterized by
   increasingly C-4-dominated, arid and seasonal environments. The early
   Homo mandible LD 350-1 has a carbon isotope value similar to that of
   earlier Australopithecus from the LAV, possibly indicating that the
   emergence of Homo from Australopithecus did not involve a dietary shift.
   Late Pliocene LAV environments contrast with contemporaneous
   environments in the Turkana Basin, which were more woody and mesic.
   These findings have important implications for the environmental

   an agricultural soil depends on bacterial prey",FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY,2017,93,9,NA,SEP,"Predation is a fundamental mechanism of all food webs, but its drivers
   and organismic connectivities, especially at microbial level, are still
   poorly understood. Specifically, competitive carbon flows in the
   presence of multiple micropredators, as well as trophic links within and
   between microbial kingdoms have rarely been resolved. Here, using
   maize-planted agricultural soil as a model system, we have investigated
   the predation of amended bacterial prey by both prokaryotic and
   eukaryotic micropredators. We have queried how soil compartment
   (rhizosphere vs bulk soil) and nature of prey (Gram-positive vs
   Gram-negative) influence predation outcomes. We added C-13-labelled
   biomass of Pseudomonas putida and Arthrobacter globiformis to soil
   microcosms and found that P. putida was consumed much more rapidly.
   Bacteria and microeukaryotes specifically responsive to the biomass
   amendments were identified by RNA-stable isotope probing. Amongst the
   bacteria, only a few myxobacteria sequestered C from A. globiformis,
   whereas a considerable diversity of predatory bacteria incorporated C
   derived from P. putida. Diverse groups of heterotrophic protists,
   especially amoeba including Glaeseria, Hartmanella and Vahlkampfia spp.,
   were observed to incorporate C-13 from both amendments, but with
   pronounced niche differentiation between rhizosphere and bulk soil. This
   provides novel insights into niche partitioning between bacterial and
   eukaryotic micropredators in soil, driven not only by the nature of

   significant, but these impacts may be modified by other environmental
   factors, especially when migratory populations are small. This study
   implements a before-after (BA) impact design and takes advantage of
   natural, reach-scale variation in channel gradient to explore how
   environmental context influences the response of stream and riparian
   ecosystems to a small, recolonizing population of anadromous Pacific
   salmon. After a 102-y absence, adult Pacific salmon began naturally
   recolonizing the Cedar River in northwest Washington, USA, following
   installation of a fish passage at the Landsburg Dam in 2003. For our BA
   analysis, we sampled water chemistry, stream biofilm, aquatic
   macroinvertebrates, and fish assemblages before (1999-2003) and after
   (2008, 2015) fish passage installation in 3 study reaches above the dam.
   We also conducted an above-dam reach-scale (n = 7) comparison in 2015,
   for which we sampled the same metrics, as well as riparian spider and
   bird assemblages, across 500-m-long sections in each study reach,
   spanning a total of 18 km of river habitat that varied in both adult
   salmon inputs and channel gradient. The BA and reach-scale analyses both
   indicated that salmon biomass inputs were associated with increases in
   aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa richness and the densities of 2 primary
   consumers (Glossosoma spp. and Chironomidae larvae). Stable isotope
   analysis indicated that adult salmon subsidies were also associated with
   dietary changes in pelagic-foraging predators (the non-anadromous
   resident Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum, 1792) and
   benthic-foraging sculpin (Cottus spp.). The reach-scale analysis also
   showed that channel gradient best explained variation in several
   metrics, including a negative association with adult Chinook Salmon
   inputs (r = -0.70, p = 0.08) and bird diversity (r = -0.91, p < 0.01).
   We found that channel gradient was a key driver of observed biotic
   variation through its effects on channel morphology and complexity,
   factors that influence biotic assemblages and ecosystem processes.
   Overall, this study provides a holistic assessment of the ecosystem
   impacts of a small recolonizing salmon population while accounting for
   spatial variation in stream geomorphology. Understanding these dynamics

   conservation concern, stable isotope analysis (SIA) of delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 values of tissue from museum collections and ongoing
   non-invasive monitoring programs offers an effective approach. Here, we
   assessed the long-term alterations in the trophic structure of a
   generalist large carnivore over a time of population loss and recovery.
   Wolverine stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes
   were measured in hair samples collected from 44 individuals in Finland
   for the period 1905-2020, and potential dietary were quantified using
   isotopic niche metrics shifts in two study areas. We provide evidence of
   a long-term diet shift in Finnish wolverines, with a temporal depletion
   of hair's delta C-13 (beta = -0.016 parts per thousand, R-2 = 0.46, p <
   0.001). Correspondingly, there was a shift in the isotopic niches of the
   Historical population (before the year 2000) and Recent population
   (after 2000), with the niche overlap between the Historical and Recent
   periods being only 33\% throughout Finland, and even lower in the two
   study areas (22\% to 24\%). The breadth of the isotopic niche, however,
   did not significantly differ between the two periods, suggesting that
   despite a change in diet composition, wolverines did not specialize
   more. The trophic level of wolverines in Finland was stable throughout
   the study period, with no significant change in delta N-15 with time
   (beta = 0.0055 parts per thousand, R-2 = 0.043, p = 0.17). In summary:
   A) the strong trophic resilience of this top predator was shown by the
   stability of its niche breadth and trophic level feeding regime during
   periods of population decline and recovery as well as during a period of
   major anthropogenic alterations in their environment; B) the use of SIA
   methods on historical and recent hairs provided a unique tool to unravel
   long-term changes in wolverine feeding strategies.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Massé, CF (Corresponding Author), Univ Oulu, Ecol \& Genet Res Unit, Oulu, Finland.

   Mediterranean coastal ecosystem",FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2022,10,NA,NA,SEP 8,"Biological invasions are a widespread problem worldwide, as invasive
   non-indigenous species (NIS) may affect native populations through
   direct (e. g., predation) or indirect (e.g., competition) trophic
   interactions, leading to changes in the food web structure. The trophic
   relationships of the invasive eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki
   and the native big-scale sand smelt Atherina boyeri coexisting in three
   Mediterranean coastal ponds characterized by different trophic statuses
   (from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic) were assessed in spring through
   isotopic niche analysis and Bayesian mixing models. The two fish relied
   on the distinctive trophic pathways in the different ponds, with the
   evidence of minimal interspecific niche overlap indicating site-specific
   niche divergence mechanisms. In more detail, under hypereutrophic and
   mesotrophic conditions, the two species occupied different trophic
   positions but relying on a single trophic pathway, whereas, under
   oligotrophic conditions, both occupied a similar trophic position but
   belonging to distinct trophic pathways. Furthermore, the invaders showed
   the widest niche breadth while the native species showed a niche
   compression and displacement in the ponds at a higher trophic status
   compared to the oligotrophic pond. We argue that this may be the result
   of an asymmetric competition arising between the two species because of
   the higher competitive ability of G. holbrooki and may have been further
   shaped by the trophic status of the ponds, through a conjoint effect of
   prey availability and habitat complexity. While the high trophic
   plasticity and adaptability of both species to different environmental
   features and resource availability may have favored their coexistence
   through site-specific mechanisms of niche segregation, we provide also
   empirical evidence of the importance of environmental control in invaded
   food webs, calling for greater attention to this aspect in future

   their stable isotope, amino acid, and fatty acid composition",MARINE BIODIVERSITY,2023,53,6,NA,DEC,"Holothurians are the dominant megabenthic deposit feeders in the Peru
   Basin (SE Pacific) and feed to various degrees of selectivity on a
   heterogenous pool of sedimentary detritus, but drivers of feeding
   selectivity and diet preferences for most holothurian species are
   unknown. This study reconstructs the diets of 13 holothurian species of
   the orders Elasipodida, Holothuriida, and Synallactida. Bulk stable
   isotope analyses (delta 13C, delta 15N) of holothurian body wall and gut
   wall tissues, gut contents, and feces were combined with
   compound-specific stable isotope analyses of amino acids,
   phospholipid-derived fatty acids, and neutral-lipid-derived fatty acids
   in the body wall. We further assessed how holothurians in the Peru Basin
   partition their resources and calculated how much of the daily
   particulate organic carbon (POC) flux to the area is ingested by them
   using information about gut contents of nine species. To assess the
   dependence of holothurians on fresh phytodetritus, we performed in situ
   pulse-chase experiments using 13C- and 15N-enriched phytodetritus. By
   measuring the uptake of this phytodetritus in fatty acids and amino
   acids and by comparing it with the presence of these compounds in the
   sediment, we calculated net accumulation and net deficiency for specific
   fatty acids and amino acids and discussed how climate change might
   affect the dependence on specific compounds. A Sorensen-Dice
   coefficient-based cluster analysis using data from trophic levels,
   levels of heterotrophic re-synthesis of amino acids, feeding
   selectivity, and food sources/diet suggested two major trophic groups
   with two optional subgroups each. Species-specific traits of locomotion,
   tentacle morphology, and gut structure likely allow resource
   partitioning and differences in selectivity among the holothurians, of
   which a subpopulation of 65\% of all specimens can ingest 4 to 27\% of
   the daily POC flux to the Peru Basin. Holothurians are specifically
   dependent on the uptake of arachidonic acid from phytodetritus, while
   most essential amino acids are available in the Peru Basin in sufficient
   concentrations.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",Article,English,"Stratmann, T (Corresponding Author), NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Ocean Syst OCS, Texel, Netherlands.

   sustainable harvesting of fisheries worldwide. Knowledge of trophic
   interactions is crucial since changes in trophic balances can induce
   severe changes in the structure of marine communities. While advocated
   for deep-sea fisheries, a lack of studies in the benthopelagic area
   persist. The Antarctic toothfish, Dissostichus mawsoni, is a top
   predator inhabiting the Southern Ocean deep-sea and a high-value species
   in a fishery managed by CCAMLR (Commission for the Conservation of
   Antarctic Marine Living Resources). Previous studies suggested a
   geographical variability in its diet, but never studying it in the same
   year. We analysed stomach contents and stable isotopes of delta N-15 and
   delta C-13 in the muscle of D. mawsoni captured in three fishing areas
   from the Amundsen and Dumont D'Urville Seas, during the 2016/17 fishing
   season. Although significant spatial differences were found, five taxa
   were found in all sites, Antimora rostrata, Macrourus spp., Muraenolepis
   spp., Moroteuthopsis longimana and Psychroteuthis glacialis. High
   diversity of prey confirms D. mawsoni as a generalist feeder. Values of
   delta N-15 showed similar trophic position across areas, in contrast to
   the differences found in delta C-13 values. GLM showed that delta N-15
   and delta C-13 values varied with otolith length, latitude and the
   opposite isotope, i.e. delta C-13 and delta N-15 respectively.

   changes and mammalian evolution in Africa, but high-resolution
   examinations of the fossil and climatic records have been hampered by
   poor sampling. By using fossils from the well-dated Shungura Formation
   (lower Omo Valley, northern Turkana Basin, southern Ethiopia), we
   investigate palaeodietary changes in one bovid and in one suid lineage
   from 3 to 2 Ma using stable isotope analysis of tooth enamel. Results
   show unexpectedly large increases in C-4 dietary intake around 2.8 Ma in
   both the bovid and suid, and possibly in a previously reported
   hippopotamid species. Enamel delta C-13 values after 2.8 Ma in the bovid
   (Tragelaphus nakuae) are higher than recorded for any living
   tragelaphin, and are not expected given its conservative dental
   morphology. A shift towards increased C-4 feeding at 2.8 Ma in the suid
   (Kolpochoerus limnetes) appears similarly decoupled from a
   well-documented record of dental evolution indicating gradual and
   progressive dietary change. The fact that two, perhaps three, disparate
   Pliocene herbivore lineages exhibit similar, and contemporaneous changes
   in dietary behaviour suggests a common environmental driver. Local and
   regional pollen, palaeosol and faunal records indicate increased aridity
   but no corresponding large and rapid expansion of grasslands in the
   Turkana Basin at 2.8 Ma. Our results provide new evidence supporting
   ecological change in the eastern African record around 2.8 Ma, but raise
   questions about the resolution at which different ecological proxies may
   be comparable, the correlation of vegetation and faunal change, and the

   ecosystems has been a focus of long-term debate among ecologists and
   evolutionary biologists. Such coexistence can be promoted by trophic
   plasticity and seasonal changes in omnivorous feeding. We combined
   stomach content and stable isotope analyses to determine how seasonal
   variation in resource availability influences the consumption and
   assimilation of resources by two syntopic fish species, Psalidodon aff.
   gymnodontus and P. bifasciatus, in the Lower Iguacu basin. We also
   tested the impact of seasonality on trophic niche breadth and diet
   overlap of these two dominant omnivores. Seasonal changes in resource
   availability strongly influenced the consumption and assimilation of
   resources by the two fish species. Both species exhibited high levels of
   omnivory, characterized by high diversity of allochthonous resources in
   the wet season. Terrestrial invertebrates were the main component of
   diet during this season. However, in the dry season, both species
   reduced their isotopic niches, indicating diet specialization. High diet
   overlap was observed in both seasons, but the isotopic niche overlap was
   smaller in the dry season. Substantial reduction in the isotopic niche
   of P. bifascistus and a shift toward aquatic invertebrates can
   facilitate coexistence during this season of resource shortage. Feeding
   plasticity allows omnivorous fish to adjust their trophic niches
   according to seasonality, promoting the exploitation of different
   resources during periods of greater resource diversity. This seasonal
   variation could be an important mechanism that contributes to the
   resource partitioning and coexistence of dominant omnivores in
   Neotropical streams.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Neves, MP (Corresponding Author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, Dept Zool, Programa Posgrad Biol Anim, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.

   invertebrates in various marine ecosystems, as well as being a valuable
   fisheries resource. At the World Malacological Congress, held 21 - 28
   July 2013 in Ponta Delgada, Azores, Portugal, a number of cephalopod
   experts convened to honour the contribution of the late Malcolm R.
   Clarke, FRS (1930 - 2013) to cephalopod research. Endorsed by the
   Cephalopod International Advisory Council (CIAC), the meeting discussed
   some of the major challenges that cephalopod research will face in the
   future. These challenges were identified as follows: (1) to find new
   ways to ascertain the trophic role and food web links of cephalopods
   using hard tissues, stable isotopes and novel concepts in theoretical
   ecology; (2) to explore new approaches to the study of cephalopod
   morphology; (3) to further develop cephalopod aquaculture research; (4)
   to find new ways to ascertain cephalopod adaptation and response to
   environmental change; (5) to strengthen cephalopod genetics research;
   and (6) to develop new approaches for cephalopod fisheries and
   conservation. The present paper presents brief reviews on these topics,
   followed by a discussion of the general challenges that cephalopod
   research is bound to face in the near future. By contributing to
   initiatives both within CIAC and independent of CIAC, the principle aim
   of the paper is to stimulate future cephalopod research.",CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",Article,English,"Xavier, JC (Corresponding Author), Univ Coimbra, Inst Marine Res, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal.

   Snook habitat use across variable nutrient environments",FISHERIES RESEARCH,2019,218,NA,35-47,OCT,"Habitat selection by organisms can be driven by a number of factors,
   including the availability of resources. In particular, nutrient
   enrichment can alter the quality of landscapes, and thus the
   availability of resources, with implications for consumer movement and
   habitat use. In coastal ecosystems, eutrophication can affect the
   production and distribution of resources, and thus the behaviors and
   space use of consumers. In this study, we coupled acoustic telemetry
   methods and stable isotope analyses (SIA) to examine the effects of
   nutrient enrichment on the movement, habitat use, and resource use of
   Common Snook (Centropomus undecimalis), a valuable recreational fishery,
   across two neighboring estuarine lake systems of varying trophic state
   (eutrophic vs. mesotrophic), located in Florida Bay (Florida, USA).
   Snook had more inter-zone movement events in the mesotrophic system,
   suggesting higher mobility. More specifically, increased inter-zone
   movement events were observed in the upstream and middle zones of the
   mesotrophic system where salinity and submerged aquatic vegetation was
   lower, and Chlorophyll a levels were higher. We also observed longer
   movement event durations in the eutrophic system, suggesting higher
   residency and a trend for event durations to vary across zones. Based on
   delta N-15, delta C-13 and delta S-34 analyses, we determined that
   although Snook had similar trophic levels across systems, eutrophic
   Snook relied on a greater diversity of basal sources relative to
   mesotrophic Snook. When relating movement to trophic metrics, we found
   the relationship to be zone-dependent, with higher trophic level Snook
   showing more movements into the middle and downstream zones, but less
   movements into the upstream zones. These findings highlight the value of
   cross-site comparisons that pair movement and trophic measurements to
   improve our understanding of how animals select habitats under varying
   environmental conditions and production regimes.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Eggenberger, CW (Corresponding Author), Florida Int Univ, Earth \& Environm, 11200 SW 8th St AHC5 389, Miami, FL 33199 USA.

   using stomach contents and δ<SUP>13</SUP>C and δ<SUP>15</SUP>N stable
   isotopes",DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY,2017,135,NA,124-136,JAN,"We used stomach content and stable delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotope
   analyses to investigate male and female snow crab diets over a range of
   body sizes (30-130 mm carapace width) in five regions of the Pacific
   Arctic (southern and northern Chukchi Sea, western, central, and
   Canadian Beaufort Sea). Snow crab stomach contents from the southern
   Chukchi Sea were also compared to available prey biomass and abundance.
   Snow crabs consumed four main prey taxa: polychaetes, decapod
   crustaceans (crabs, amphipods), echinoderms (mainly ophiuroids), and
   mollusks (bivalves, gastropods). Both approaches revealed regional
   differences. Crab diets in the two Chukchi regions were similar to those
   in the western Beaufort (highest bivalve, amphipod, and crustacean
   consumption). The Canadian Beaufort region was most unique in prey
   composition and in stable isotope values. We also observed a trend of
   decreasing carbon stable isotopes in crabs from the Chukchi to those in
   the Canadian Beaufort, likely reflecting the increasing use of
   terrestrial carbon sources towards the eastern regions of the Beaufort
   Sea from Mackenzie River influx. Cannibalism on snow crabs was higher in
   the Chukchi regions relative to the Beaufort regions. We suggest that
   cannibalism may have an impact on recruitment in the Chukchi Sea via
   reduction of cohort strength after settlement to the benthos, as known
   from the Canadian Atlantic. Prey composition varied with crab size only
   in some size classes in the southern Chukchi and central Beaufort, while
   stable isotope results showed no size-dependent differences. Slightly
   although significantly higher mean carbon isotope values for males in
   the southern Chukchi may not be reflective of a gender-specific pattern
   but rather be driven by low sample size. Finally, the lack of prey
   selection relative to availability in crabs in the southern Chukchi
   suggests that crabs consume individual prey taxa in relative proportions
   to prey field abundances. The present study is the first to provide a
   baseline of the omnivorous role of snow crabs across the entire Pacific
   Arctic, as well as evidence for cannibalism in the Chukchi Sea. In light
   of climate change predictions for the Alaska Arctic, and the potential
   for future fisheries harvest of snow crabs in this region, continued
   monitoring of snow crabs, including population and trophic dynamics, is
   increasingly important to assess snow crab impacts on benthic
   communities and vice versa. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Divine, LM (Corresponding Author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, POB 757220, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.

   geographical range of the quokka (<i>Setonix brachyurus</i>)",JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,2020,311,2,106-115,JUN,"European arrival into Australia had large-scale impacts on the local
   flora and fauna. Most notably, Europeans brought with them numerous
   non-native species, including the European red fox (Vulpes vulpes),
   European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and the goat (Capra hircus)
   among many others. The introduction of these species had significant
   consequences on native Australian mammals, causing some small- to
   medium-sized herbivores to become geographically restricted to primarily
   islands. Here, we examined the dietary ecology of the quokka (Setonix
   brachyurus), a native marsupial herbivore with a restricted geographic
   range in Western Australia before and after European arrival. Fossils
   from south-western Australia and modern specimens were examined via
   dental microwear texture analysis and stable isotope analysis to assess
   whether the diet of the quokka had changed dramatically over time.
   Collectively, we help clarify whether there were any ecological reasons
   as to why this marsupial became geographically restricted, aside from
   the presence of invasive predators on mainland Australia. The quokka
   maintains a browsing diet from the Pleistocene to the present on the
   mainland, but modern island populations eat drier and tougher foods when
   living on islands lacking invasive mammals. There is also an apparent
   shift in the feeding environment of the quokkas on mainland Australia,
   from more open forests/shrublands in the Pleistocene to denser and
   wetter forests. Multi-proxy data collectively indicate that the
   restricted range of the quokka today is most likely a result of
   predation from non-native taxa and/or other human influences-not because

   intensity of the sardine run (Sardinops sagax) have been documented in
   recent years along the coastline of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. This
   study aimed to determine whether variations in the availability of
   sardine were reflected in the diet and condition of common dolphins
   (Delphinus capensis) over the past three decades. Stomach contents from
   95 common dolphins incidentally caught between 2000 and 2009 were
   analysed and compared to historical data collected between 1972 and
   1992. A shift in the principal prey species consumed by the dolphins was
   observed over the past 30 years. Prior to 1992, sardine comprised up to
   49 \% of the total stomach contents by mass, whilst chub mackerel
   (Scomber japonicus) was the dominant prey recorded in the stomach
   contents between 2000 and 2009 (66 \%). As common dolphins prey on
   locally abundant fish species, this dietary shift may indicate changes
   in the availability of the most abundant fish prey. Stable isotope
   analyses of tooth tissue revealed no significant changes in the delta
   N-15 and delta C-13 isotopic ratios over the past three decades (P =
   0.283 for N and P = 0.922 for C). Blubber thickness as a percentage of
   body length and blubber weight as a percentage of total body weight were
   assessed as indicators of animal condition. No significant changes in
   proportional blubber weight or blubber thickness were seen over the last
   40 years (1970-2009) for all age cohorts. This species appears to be
   well adapted to cope with changes in prey species availability, without
   impacting on body condition.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",Article,English,"Plön, S (Corresponding Author), SAIAB, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.

   urbanization",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,2015,56,NA,41-49,SEP,"Nitrogen stable isotope values (delta N-15) have commonly been used as a
   qualitative indicator of catchment urbanization in estuaries, but no
   quantitative relationship has to date been established between delta
   N-15 and degree of urbanization. We sampled five species of common
   estuarine fish (Mugil cephalus, Acanthopagrus australis, Sillago
   ciliata, Gerres subfasciatus and Herklotsichthys castelnaui) of
   different trophic levels from six estuaries in Southeast Queensland,
   Australia, to test if a quantitative relationship exists between fish
   delta N-15 and urbanization in the catchment. Degree of urbanization
   (urban \%) in the catchment adjacent to the tidal estuary was measured
   using polygons constructed in Google Earth images, and verified using
   data from the detailed Queensland Land Use Mapping Project (QLUMP).
   Significant linear relationships exist between fish delta N-15 and urban
   \% in most cases irrespective of the section of the estuary (upper,
   middle and lower) where the fish were caught, with no difference in
   slope and elevation between lines established for different sections.
   Inclusion of additional fish delta N-15 data from other Australian
   estuaries in a combined multiple regression model adding trophic level
   as a predictor generated a significant relationship predicting increase
   in fish delta N-15 values with increasing urban \% and trophic level.
   There is therefore a generic quantitative relationship between estuarine
   fish delta N-15 values and degree of urbanization applicable to
   different fish species, geographic location or feeding habit. While the
   generality of this relationship needs to be tested further in other
   geographic locations, our findings potentially improve the applicability
   of fish delta N-15 values as a quantitative indicator of urban influence

   markedly in response to climate change. Range-expanding fish encounter
   novel diets and environments, but we know little about how these

   relative growth rate, morphometric condition and trophic niche of
   juvenile Acanthurus triostegus, a dominant range-expanding tropical
   surgeonfish, at four locations across 10 degrees of latitude off eastern
   Australia. We related these metrics to differences in temperature and
   nutritional quality of dominant seaweeds and the epilithic algal matrix.
   Temperate food sources were richer in nitrogen than tropical diets.
   Stable isotope analysis (delta(13) carbon and delta(15) nitrogen) of
   fish muscle revealed a large trophic niche breadth at the highest
   latitude indicating a generalist foraging strategy, and more
   nitrogen-enriched isotopic signatures compared to tropical regions. Fish
   length was strongly correlated to delta C-13 in all regions, suggesting
   an ontogenetic shift in diet independent of latitude. Despite
   temperature differences of 4 degrees C, fish growth and body condition
   were similar across tropical and temperate regions. These results
   suggest that more nutritious temperate diets may compensate for the
   effects of cooler water temperatures. Neither summer water temperatures

   Animals from the Qinglongquan Site, China",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OSTEOARCHAEOLOGY,2018,28,2,85-94,MAR-APR,"The Qinglongquan site, China, includes materials from the Neolithic
   Qujialing (3000-2600 bc) and Shijiahe (2600-2200 bc) periods, and lies
   within the Sui-Zao Corridor that connects the Nanyang Basin in the north
   and the Hanjiang River Plain in the south. Previous research suggested a
   dietary shift from rice-based to millet-based agriculture between the
   Qujialing and Shijiehe periods at this site. The reason for this dietary
   shift is still unclear, and it is possible because of immigration into
   the region by people who already had a mainly C-4-millet-based diet
   (i.e. from Northern China). In this study, we examine the carbon (C-13)
   and nitrogen (N-15) results and present sulfur (S-34) isotope analyses
   of human (n=27) and animal (n=36) samples to test the hypothesis of
   whether this dietary shift was due to migration. The S-34 values of the
   Qujialing humans ranged from 5.5 parts per thousand to 8.1 parts per
   thousand {[}average 6.5 parts per thousand +/- 1.0 (n=7)], and the S-34
   values of the Shijiahe humans ranged from 4.1 parts per thousand to 7.4
   parts per thousand {[}average 5.8 parts per thousand +/- 0.9 (n=18)].
   Because these values overlapped and were similar to the animal S-34
   results {[}4.3 parts per thousand to 8.8 parts per thousand, average of
   6.6 +/- 1.3 parts per thousand (n=31)], no evidence of migration was
   found for the humans with the different diets at the Qinglongquan site.

   AMERICA",2011,108,3,1011-1015,JAN 18,"Despite the importance of the nitrogen (N) cycle on marine productivity,
   little is known about variability in N sources and cycling in the ocean
   in relation to natural and anthropogenic climate change. Beyond the last
   few decades of scientific observation, knowledge depends largely on
   proxy records derived from nitrogen stable isotopes (delta N-15)
   preserved in sediments and other bioarchives. Traditional bulk delta
   N-15 measurements, however, represent the combined influence of N source
   and subsequent trophic transfers, often confounding environmental
   interpretation. Recently, compound-specific analysis of individual amino
   acids (delta N-15-AA) has been shown as a means to deconvolve trophic
   level versus N source effects on the delta N-15 variability of bulk
   organic matter. Here, we demonstrate the first use of delta N-15-AA in a
   paleoceanographic study, through analysis of annually secreted growth
   rings preserved in the organic endoskeletons of deep-sea gorgonian
   corals. In the Northwest Atlantic off Nova Scotia, coral delta N-15 is
   correlated with increasing presence of subtropical versus subpolar slope
   waters over the twentieth century. By using the new delta N-15-AA
   approach to control for variable trophic processing, we are able to
   interpret coral bulk delta N-15 values as a proxy for nitrate source
   and, hence, slope water source partitioning. We conclude that the
   persistence of the warm, nutrient-rich regime since the early 1970s is
   largely unique in the context of the last approximately 1,800 yr. This
   evidence suggests that nutrient variability in this region is
   coordinated with recent changes in global climate and underscores the
   broad potential of delta N-15-AA for paleoceanographic studies of the

   England, more than 100 years ago, but relatively little is known of its
   potential ecological impacts on native species and ecosystems. In
   England, the pumpkinseed is currently established in ponds of the River
   Ouse (Sussex) and its flood plain. Escapee pumpkinseeds are found in
   some small tributaries that contain native species of conservation
   interest (brown trout Salmo trutta, brook lamprey Lampetra planeri,
   European eel Anguilla anguilla, European bullhead Cottus gobio). We used
   using electrofishing surveys and telemetry methods to examine the
   interactions between pumpkinseeds and native stream fishes (mainly brown
   trout), including predator prey relationships, home range size,
   microhabitat preferences, home range fidelity, and habitat
   overlap/repartition. To assess impacts of pumpkinseed on stream food
   webs, a preliminary study quantified trout growth and food-web structure
   of a stream ecosystem (abundance of primary and secondary producers,
   fish, and riparian spiders) in reaches with and without pumpkinseed.
   Where pumpkinseeds were in high density, differences were observed in
   stream food -web structure, in proportional representation of fish
   species traits and in riparian spider community composition, but these
   differences cannot be attributed solely to pumpkinseed presence. From
   the available evidence, there appears to be little direct or indirect
   adverse impact of pumpkinseed on native species and the stream ecosystem
   when in low densities, including as a host of nonnative infectious
   agents. However, this could change under conditions of climate warming,
   which are likely to favor pumpkinseed reproduction, potentially to the
   detriment of native species. In a context in which freshwater ecosystems
   are impacted by several human and climate-induced factors acting
   synergistically, our results underline the need to study nonnative
   species impacts through a series of experimental and long-term studies

   after introduced species become established, more gradual effects may
   take years to manifest and can thus require long-term data for
   quantification. We analyzed an 8-year record of stable isotope data on
   Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) from southern California to infer
   how the trophic position of this widespread invasive species changes
   over time as native ant species are displaced. We couple this
   longitudinal analysis with a biregional comparison of stable isotope
   data (delta N-15) on ants from Argentina (native range) and California
   (introduced range) to quantify (i) how the trophic position of L. humile
   differs between native and introduced populations, and (h) how relative
   trophic position as estimated by delta N-15 values of Argentine ants
   compare with those of other ants at the same site. Both long-term and
   biregional comparisons indicate that the Argentine ant's relative
   trophic position is reduced at sites with a longer history of
   occupation. over the course of 8 years, the relative trophic position of
   L. humile remained high at the leading edge of an invasion front but
   declined, on average, behind the front as native ants disappeared.
   Relative to native populations, where L. humile is among the most
   carnivorous of ants, Argentine ants from California occupied lower
   trophic positions. These results support the hypothesis that Argentine
   ants shift their diet after establishment as a result of resource
   depletion and increasing reliance on plant-based resources, especially
   honeydew-producing Hemiptera. Our results demonstrate the value of

   Interest (SNI) since 2002 and has been closed to any human activity
   awaiting to be remediated according to national laws. Our results
   indicate that, two decades after the SNI declaration (a decade after the
   plant decommissioning), there is no longer any sign of the impact of
   historical contaminations on macrofauna and benthic food web
   functioning. Overall, all the thirty-six sites showed high/good
   ecological quality according to the score assigned by AMBI and M-AMBI
   indexes, reflecting the absence of chronic impacts. Our findings reveal,
   for the first time, the positive effects of passive restoration (i.e.,
   unassisted, or spontaneous recovery following cessation of anthropogenic
   impacts) on historically impacted coastal ecosystems since their health
   conditions, in terms of both abiotic (environmental variables and
   contaminant concentration) and biotic (macrofauna diversity and
   community composition, and benthic food-web structure) factors, were
   indistinguishable from surrounding non-impacted areas. These findings
   also suggest that other effective area-based conservation measures
   (OECMs) could be useful not only for biodiversity conservation of
   vulnerable and priority habitats in larger ocean sectors but also to
   promote the passive recovery of historically contaminated ecosystems.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Corinaldesi, C (Corresponding Author), Natl Biodivers Future Ctr, Palermo, Italy.

   used to determine the trophic position and relative importance of
   benthic and pelagic pathways for different life stages and species of
   the major fishes and invertebrate prey in Lake Washington. Significant
   coupling of the benthic and pelagic pathways was evident in this complex
   food web across seasons and fish ontogenies. Among apex predators,
   cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii and northern pikeminnow
   Ptychocheilus oregonensis shifted ontogenetically from benthic omnivory
   to pelagic piscivory, whereas yellow perch Perca flavescens shifted from
   pelagic zooplanktivory to benthic piscivory. Apex predators continued to
   rely on benthic prey seasonally, particularly in winter and spring.
   Benthic pathways were less important to the current diets of apex
   predators than they were during the recovery from eutrophication in the
   1970s. Surprisingly, the delta N-15 values for copepods during winter
   and for zooplanktivorous longfin smelt Spirinchus thaleichthys and
   threespine sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus were similar to those for
   top piscivores, whereas the significantly lower values for
   zooplanktivorous juvenile sockeye salmon O. nerka were more similar to
   expectations. Nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios of pelagic planktivores
   and invertebrates also varied seasonally. Mixing model results showed
   that stable isotopes and stomach contents were comparable for
   determining ontogenetic trends, but stable isotopes established these
   trends with many fewer samples and less variability and accurately
   portrayed ontogenetic trends when few stomach samples were available.

   importance of local vs. allochthonous carbon sources and on microbial
   food-web functioning and structure. Over the year ecosystem metabolism
   varies as a result of seasonal changes in environmental parameters such
   as nutrient levels, light, temperature, and variability in the food web.
   This is reflected in isotopic compositions of phytoplankton and
   bacteria. Here, we present the results of a 17-month study on carbon
   dynamics in two basins of Lake Naarden, The Netherlands. One basin was
   restored after anthropogenic eutrophication, whereas the other basin
   remained eutrophic. We analyzed natural stable carbon isotope abundances
   (C-13) of dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and
   macrophytes, and combined these data with compound-specific C-13
   analyses of phospholipid-derived fatty acids, produced by phytoplankton
   and bacteria. Isotopic fractionation (epsilon) between phytoplankton
   biomass and CO2(aq) was similar for diatoms and other eukaryotic
   phytoplankton, and differences between sampling sites were small.
   Highest epsilon values were observed in winter with values of 23.5 +/-
   0.6 parts per thousand for eukaryotic phytoplankton and 13.6 +/- 0.3
   parts per thousand for cyanobacteria. Lowest epsilon values were
   observed in summer: 10.5 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand for eukaryotic
   phytoplankton and 2.7 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand for cyanobacteria. The
   annual range in C-13(bact) was between 6.9 parts per thousand and 8.2
   parts per thousand for the restored and eutrophic basin, respectively,
   while this range was between 11.6 parts per thousand and 13.1 parts per
   thousand for phytoplankton in the restored and eutrophic basin,
   respectively. Correlations between C-13(phyto) and C-13(bact) were
   strong at both sites. During summer and fall, bacterial biomass derives
   mainly from locally produced organic matter, with minor allochthonous
   contributions. Conversely, during winter, bacterial dependence on
   allochthonous carbon was 39-77\% at the restored site, and 17-46\% at
   the eutrophic site.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Middelburg, JJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Earth Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands.

   floodplain regions of a large river",OECOLOGIA,1998,117,4,551-563,DEC,"Analyses of stable isotope (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) and C:N ratios of
   food webs within a floodplain and a constricted-channel region of the
   Ohio River during October 1993 and July 1994 indicate that the
   increasingly influential flood pulse concept (FPC) does not, for either
   location, adequately address food web structure for this very large
   river. Furthermore, results of this study suggest that the riverine
   productivity model (RPM) is more appropriate than the widely known river
   continuum concept (RCC) for the constricted region of this river. These
   conclusions are based on stable isotope analyses of potential sources of
   organic matter (riparian C-3 trees, riparian C-4 grasses and
   agricultural crops, submerged macrophytes, benthic filamentous algae,
   benthic particulate organic matter, and transported organic matter
   containing detritus and phytoplankton) and various functional feeding
   groups of invertebrate and fish consumers. The FPC, which stresses the
   key contribution of organic matter, particularly terrestrial organic
   matter, originating from the floodplain to riverine food webs, was
   judged inappropriate for the floodplain region of the Ohio River for
   hydrodynamic and biotic reasons. The rising limb and peak period of
   discharge typically occur in November through March when temperatures
   are low (generally much less than 10 degrees C) and greater than
   bank-full conditions are relatively unpredictable and short-lived. The
   major food potentially available to riverine organisms migrating into
   the floodplain would be decaying vegetation because autotrophic
   production is temperature and light limited and terrestrial insect
   production is minimal at that time. It is clear from our data that
   terrestrial C-4 plants contribute little, if anything, to the consumer
   food web (based on delta(13)C values), and delta(15)N values for C-3
   plants, coarse benthic organic matter, and fine benthic organic matter
   were too depleted (similar to 7-12 parts per thousand, lower than most
   invertebrate consumer values) for this organic matter to be supporting
   the food web. The RPM, which emphasizes the primary role of autotrophic
   production in large rivers, is the most viable of the remaining two
   ecosystem models for the constricted-channel region of the Ohio based on
   stable isotope linkage between sources and consumers of organic matter
   in the food web. The most important form of food web organic matter is
   apparently transported (suspended) fine (FTOM) and ultra-fine
   particulate organic matter. We propose that phytoplankton and detritus
   of an autochthonous origin in the seston would rep resent a more usable
   energy source for benthic (bivalve molluscs, hydropsychid caddisflies)
   and planktonic (microcrustaceans) suspension feeders than the more
   refractory allochthonous materials derived from upstream processing of
   terrestrial organic matter. Benthic grazers depend heavily on
   nonfilamentous benthic algae (based on gut analysis from a separate
   study), but filamentous benthic algae have no apparent connection to
   invertebrate consumers (based on delta(13)C values). Amphipod and
   crayfish show a strong relationship to aquatic macrophytes (possibly
   through detrital organic matter rather than living plant tissue). These
   observations contrast with the prediction of the RCC that food webs in
   large rivers are based principally on refractory FTOM and dissolved
   organic matter from upstream inefficiencies in organic-matter processing
   and the bacteria growing upon these suspended or dissolved detrital
   compounds.
   The conclusions drawn here for the Ohio River cannot yet be extended to
   other floodplain and constricted-channel rivers in temperate and
   tropical latitudes until more comparable data are available on
   relatively pristine and moderately regulated rivers.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Article,English,"Thorp, JH (Corresponding Author), Clarkson Univ, Sch Sci, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA.

   feed intensively at sea during summer. In Cumberland Sound, Nunavut,
   Canada, there has been a recent increased availability of a forage fish,
   Capelin. To investigate changes over time in Arctic Char foraging, we
   assessed Arctic Char trophic niche from 2002 to 2011 using stomach
   content analysis and stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15)
   of muscle tissue from two river/lake systems, Isuituq and Kipisa. We
   also compared population characteristics by calculating Fulton's
   condition factor (K) and by fitting von Bertalanffy growth curves with
   length-at-age data. Results revealed Capelin were newly present in the
   diets of Arctic Char in 2011, describing a shift from a primarily
   invertebrate-based to a fish-based diet. No trend in delta N-15 over
   time suggests that the trophic level of Arctic Char has not changed;
   however, the delta C-15 for both systems converged in 2011 on a value
   suggestive of feeding on Capelin. Growth curves and length-at-age

   climate-driven change in prey availability on the degree of individual
   and population specialization of a large marine predator, the fin whale
   (Balaenoptera physalus). We examined skin biopsies from 99 fin whales
   sampled in the St. Lawrence Estuary (Canada) over a nine year period
   (1998-2006) during which environmental change was documented. We
   analyzed stable isotope ratios in skin and fatty acid signatures in
   blubber samples of whales, as well as in seven potential prey species,
   and diet was quantitatively assessed using Bayesian isotopic models. An
   abrupt change in fin whale dietary niche coincided with a decrease in
   biomass of their predominant prey, Arctic krill (Thysanoessa spp.). This
   dietary niche widening toward generalist diets occurred in nearly 60\%
   of sampled individuals. The fin whale population, typically composed of
   specialists of either krill or lipid-rich pelagic fishes, shifted toward
   one composed either of krill specialists or true generalists feeding on
   various zooplankton and fish prey. This change likely reduced
   intraspecific competition. In the context of the current
   ``Atlantification{''} of northern water masses, our findings emphasize

   goal in ecology and conservation biology. Seabirds are commonly used as
   sentinels of marine ecosystems, but there is a lack of quantitative
   information providing a synoptic view of their community structure and
   of its underlying mechanisms. We used stable isotope analysis of chick
   feathers to investigate the structure of 2 communities that are
   representative of the subantarctic (Kerguelen) and Antarctic (Adelie
   Land) seabird diversity. Total area of the convex hull (a measure of the
   total delta C-13-delta N-15 niche space) was 8.4-fold higher at the
   Kerguelen Islands than in Adelie Land, a consequence of the higher
   seabird diversity at the former locality. Kerguelen seabirds grouped
   into 2 clusters of oceanic and inshore species, with the latter group
   not represented in Adelie Land. Communities are primarily structured by
   the availability of foraging habitats (delta C-13) and then of trophic
   resources (delta N-15), with body size being a major driving force of
   trophic position. Ecological characteristics are more important than
   phylogeny to shape seabird isotopic niche breadth (standard ellipse area
   corrected for small sample size, SEAc), with no significant differences
   between Sphenisciformes, Procellariiformes, and Charadriiformes. By
   contrast, SEAc varies according to foraging guilds, diet, and a
   specialist-generalist gradient, with ubiquitous seabirds having a
   10-fold larger mean SEAc than pelagic divers. This study sets a baseline
   against which the effects of long-term environmental changes on seabird
   community structure can be studied across years and conditions, and

   multi-trophic level responses at ocean basin scales",PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY,2009,81,"1-4, SI",214-222,APR-JUN,"Variation in life history traits of organisms is thought to reflect
   adaptations to environmental forcing occurring from bottom-up and
   top-down processes. Such variation occurs not only among, but also
   within species, indicating demographic plasticity in response to
   environmental conditions. From a broad literature review, we present
   evidence for ocean basin- and large marine ecosystem-scale variation in
   intra-specific life history traits, with similar responses occurring
   among trophic levels from relatively short-lived secondary producers to
   very long-lived apex predators. Between North Atlantic and North Pacific
   Ocean basins, for example, species in the Eastern Pacific exhibited
   either later maturation, lower fecundity, and/or greater annual survival
   than conspecifics in the Western Atlantic. Parallel variations in life
   histories among trophic levels also occur in adjacent seas and between
   eastern vs. western ocean boundaries. For example, zooplankton and
   seabird species in cooler Barents Sea waters exhibit lower fecundity or
   greater annual survival than conspecifics in the Northeast Atlantic. Sea
   turtles exhibit a larger size and a greater reproductive output in the
   Western Pacific vs. Eastern Pacific. These examples provide evidence for
   food-web-wide modifications in life history strategies in response to
   environmental forcing. We hypothesize that such dichotomies result from
   frequency and amplitude shifts in resource availability over varying
   temporal and spatial scales. We review data that supports three primary
   mechanisms by which environmental forcing affects life history
   strategies: (1) food-web structure; (2) climate variability affecting
   the quantity and seasonality of primary productivity; (3) bottom-up vs.
   top-down forcing. These proposed mechanisms provide a framework for
   comparisons of ecosystem function among oceanic regions (or regimes) and
   are essential in modeling ecosystem response to climate change, as well
   as for creating dynamic ecosystem-based marine conservation strategies.

   sources and food web structure in ecosystems, and more recently, to
   study the effects of anthropogenic stress on aquatic ecosystems. We
   investigated the effect of nutrient enrichment on delta(13)C and
   delta(15)N in fine (FPOM), coarse (CPOM) particulate organic matter,
   periphyton, invertebrates and fish in nine boreal streams in
   south-central Sweden. In addition, we analysed the diet of benthic
   consumers using stable isotope data. Increases in delta(15)N of
   periphyton (R (2) = 0.88), CPOM (0.78), invertebrates (0.92) and fish
   (0.89) were related to nutrient enrichment. In contrast, delta(13)C
   signatures did not change along the nutrient gradient. Our results show
   that delta(15)N has potential as a sensitive indicator of nutrient
   enrichment in boreal streams. Carbon and nitrogen isotopes failed to
   elucidate putative diets of selected aquatic consumers. Indeed,
   comparison of low- and high-impact sites showed that delta(13)C of many
   consumers were found outside the ranges of basal resource delta(13)C.
   Moreover, ranges of basal resource delta(13)C and delta(15)N overlapped
   at both low and high sites, making discrimination between the importance
   of allochthonous and autochthonous production difficult. Our findings
   show that a fractionation rate of 3.4aEuro degrees is not always be

   in resource assimilation and isotopic enrichment",OECOLOGIA,2010,164,3,763-771,NOV,"Studies of food webs often employ stable isotopic approaches to infer
   trophic position and interaction strength without consideration of
   spatio-temporal variation in resource assimilation by constituent
   species. Using results from laboratory diet manipulations and monthly
   sampling of field populations, we illustrate how nitrogen isotopes may
   be used to quantify spatio-temporal variation in resource assimilation
   in ants. First, we determined nitrogen enrichment using a controlled
   laboratory experiment with the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema
   humile). After 12 weeks, worker delta N-15 values from colonies fed an
   animal-based diet had delta N-15 values that were 5.51\% greater
   compared to colonies fed a plant-based diet. The shift in delta N-15
   values in response to the experimental diet occurred within 10 weeks. We
   next reared Argentine ant colonies with or without access to
   honeydew-producing aphids and found that after 8 weeks workers from
   colonies without access to aphids had delta N-15 values that were 6.31\%
   larger compared to colonies with access to honeydew. Second, we sampled
   field populations over a 1-year period to quantify spatio-temporal
   variability in isotopic ratios of L. humile and those of a common native
   ant (Solenopsis xyloni). Samples from free-living colonies revealed that
   fluctuations in delta N-15 were 1.6-2.4aEuro degrees for L. humile and
   1.8-2.9aEuro degrees for S. xyloni. Variation was also detected among L.
   humile castes: time averaged means of delta N-15 varied from 1.2 to
   2.5aEuro degrees depending on the site, with delta N-15 values for
   queens a parts per thousand yen workers > brood. The estimated trophic
   positions of L. humile and S. xyloni were similar within a site;
   however, trophic position for each species differed significantly at
   larger spatial scales. While stable isotopes are clearly useful for
   examining the trophic ecology of arthropod communities, our results

   discharge on the coastal trophic structure. The coastal delta N-15

Article,Jianxiang Feng and Qian Huang and Hui Chen and Jiemin Guo and Guanghui Lin,"Restoration of native mangrove wetlands can reverse diet shifts of
   benthic macrofauna caused by invasive cordgrass",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2018,55,2,905-916,MAR,"1. Ecological replacement using native mangrove species combined with
   physical treatments has become an effective method in controlling the
   spread of invasive cordgrass Spartina alterniflora. To re-establish
   ecosystem functions, trophic interactions between macrofauna and their
   potential food resources must be considered during the restoration
   process.
   2. Here, we examined the changes in the diets of macrofauna in three
   restored mangrove ecosystems with different invasion histories following
   the removal of S.alterniflora in southern China. Carbon and nitrogen
   stable isotope ratios for dominant macrofauna, as well as their
   potential food sources, were analysed. The relative contributions of the
   different carbon sources to the diets of benthic macrofauna and isotopic
   niche width, including convex hull areas and standard ellipse areas of
   the macrofaunal community, were then calculated and compared among
   sampling sites in each region.
   3. Our results indicated that Spartina-derived detritus contributed to
   >80\% of the organic carbon sources of dominant macrofauna in the
   S.alterniflora communities in all three regions. Spartina alterniflora
   communities had lower convex hull areas and standard ellipse areas than
   natural mangrove forests, indicating significant resource competition
   among different consumer populations. Replacing S.alterniflora with the
   native mangrove species Kandelia obovata could reverse the diets of
   these macrofaunal species, resulting in a shift from homogeneous
   Spartina-dominated diets to more heterogeneous algae-based diets. It
   could take several decades to restore food web interactions to a
   pre-impacted state. Even the diets of macrofauna in mature mangrove
   (>40years) remained affected by the Spartina-derived organic matter.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our study reveals that the ecological
   replacement of invasive Spartina alterniflora using native mangrove
   species could restore food web function gradually. However, this removal

Article,Vanessa {De Santis} and Catherine {Gutmann Roberts} and J. Robert Britton,"Trophic consequences of competitive interactions in freshwater fish:
   Density dependent effects and impacts of inter-specific versus
   intra-specific competition",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2021,66,2,362-373,FEB,"Determining the comparative impacts of increased intra- versus
   inter-specific competition is important in freshwater ecosystems for
   understanding the ecological changes that can result from activities
   such as fish stocking events (using alien and/or native fish species),
   as well as from natural processes that elevate population abundances
   (e.g. increased annual recruitment success). While increased
   inter-specific competition can result in slower growth rates and/or
   reduced population density in the weaker or less abundant competitor, it
   is important that this is assessed in relation to the impacts of
   increased intra-specific competition.
   We tested how the strength of inter-specific competition from a
   co-existing species varies with abundance, and how this compares with
   increased intra-specific competition. Fish were the model taxa, as their
   growth rates strongly correlate with competitive success. Replicated
   pond mesocosms (150 days) used chub Squalius cephalus in an allopatric
   control (n = 5; C5) and allopatric treatment (n = 10; C10), and in
   sympatric treatments (n = 5) with European barbel Barbus barbus (n = 5
   (T1), 10 (T2) and 15 (T3)). Treatment effects were tested on
   fish-specific growth rates (SGRs), and the size and position of the
   trophic and isotopic niche (stomach contents and stable isotope {[}SI]
   analyses respectively).
   Chub SGRs were significantly higher in C5 versus all other treatments,
   but did not differ among the other allopatric and sympatric treatments.
   Chub trophic niche sizes in T1 to T3 were significantly smaller than C5,
   indicating more specialised diets in the presence of barbel. Chub
   trophic niche size in C10 was, however, larger than C5 and T1,
   indicating a shift to a more generalised diet as intra-specific
   competition increased.
   As SGRs reduced in treatments, so did the predicted extent of fish SI
   turnover, with SI data in T1 to T3 not at isotopic equilibrium with
   their diet in the mesocosms at the experiment's end. Following
   conversion of fish SI data to represent values at 95\% isotopic
   turnover, chub isotopic niches also revealed shifts to a more general
   diet as intra-specific competition increased, but to more specialised
   diets as inter-specific competition increased.
   Increased intra- and inter-specific competition impacts on the trophic
   and isotopic niches were contrasting; both metrics indicated niche
   constrictions in sympatry but niche expansions in allopatry. Impacts on
   fish growth were evident from both. These results emphasise that the
   trophic consequences of competition in freshwater fish can differ
   between stocking events involving the release of conspecifics or other
   species, with this having important considerations for how freshwater
   fish communities are managed for angling exploitation.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Britton, JR (Corresponding Author), Bournemouth Univ, Fac Sci \& Technol, Dept Life \& Environm Sci, Poole, Dorset, England.

Article,Rajeev Patnaik and Ningthoujam Premjit Singh and Debajyoti Paul and Raman Sukumar,"Dietary and habitat shifts in relation to climate of Neogene Quaternary
   proboscideans and associated mammals of the Indian subcontinent",QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS,2019,224,NA,NA,NOV 15,"y Several studies have established that African proboscideans shifted
   their feeding strategies (browsing vs. grazing) in response to climatic
   and ecological changes. However, similar studies on their Indian
   relatives are rare. In this regard, we analysed the stable carbon (delta
   C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope composition, hypsodonty indices
   (HI), and lamellae numbers of both newly recovered and existing fossil
   material (proboscideans and associated mammals) spanning the last
   similar to 14 Ma. We also obtained intra-tooth delta C-13 and delta O-18
   values of selected extant and extinct proboscideans as well as
   associated mammals to understand any intra- and inter-annual variation
   in dietary and water intake behaviour, respectively. Our results reveal
   that Middle Miocene brachydont deinotheres (ex. Deinotherium indicum)
   and bunodont gomphotheres (ex. Gomphotherium) with few cusp pairs were
   browsers living in relatively closed forests under moist conditions. By
   Late Miocene they continued browsing in relatively open forests.
   Deinotheres in the subcontinent did not survive the Late Miocene climate
   change that led to drier conditions and the spread of grasslands. The
   Late Miocene endemic forms Stegolophodon and Stegodon were browsers
   while the immigrant Choerolophodon was a mixed feeder. However, Pliocene
   gomphotheres such as bunodont Anancus and brachydont Stegodon adapted
   themselves to shrinking forests and spreading grasslands; the former
   sustained on grazing, whereas the latter showed flexibility in its diet
   ranging from browsing, mixed-feeding to pure grazing. Associated mammals
   such as rhinoceratids, giraffids, equids, and bovids responded in a
   similar manner to this climatic and ecological transition across the
   Late Miocene to Pliocene by shifting their diets accordingly. The
   Mid-Pliocene hypsodont elephantid immigrant Elephas planifrons, the
   Early Pleistocene hypsodont immigrant E. hysudricus, and Elephas
   platycephalus, with multiple lamellae (10-16) were also essentially
   grazers. Sometime around Middle Pleistocene, the giant elephantid
   immigrant Palaeoloxodon namadicus, a pure grazer, appeared on the
   grasslands of the subcontinent, coinciding with a shift in E. hysudricus
   diet from pure grazing to browsing. E. hysudricus likely gave rise to
   the extant E. maximus, a mixed feeder with higher contribution of browse
   to its diet. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Patnaik, R (Corresponding Author), Panjab Univ, Ctr Adv Study Geol, Chandigarh 160014, India.

   INTER-BASIN WATER TRANSFER SCHEME",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,2013,29,9,1131-1146,NOV,"African sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus has become established as
   a non-native invasive species in Eastern Cape, South Africa, where it
   was translocated primarily through an inter-basin water transfer scheme
   into the Great Fish and Sundays rivers. This study examined the patterns
   in catfish distribution and abundance, and compared trophic niches in
   relation to the ichthyofauna of the two rivers. Correspondence analysis
   revealed upstream to downstream gradients associated with the spatial
   distribution in species richness for most species within the mainstream
   and mainstream to tributary gradients that were associated mostly with
   the spatial distribution of native minnows in both rivers. Catfish was
   predicted to occur widely within the mainstream habitats and to decrease
   progressively from mainstreams to tributaries. Based on classification
   and regression trees, the physico-chemical environment was found to be a
   good proxy for predicting the occurrence and abundance of catfish.
   Although non-significant relationships were observed between catfish and
   other native fish species abundances, the study suggests potential
   impact due to predation and interference in habitats where the invader
   co-occurs with other fishes. Comparisons of trophic niches indicated
   higher trophic diversity for the mainstream ichthyofauna than the
   tributary communities in both rivers, suggesting an upstream to
   downstream continuum in community structure and resource availability.
   Catfish within the invaded mainstream had comparable trophic niches and
   similar dispersion patterns among individuals for both rivers, but
   indicated differences in shapes of scatter. This suggests that the
   catfish exhibited a differential response, probably in relation to
   resource availability, that may be indicative of its dietary plasticity.
   The study suggests the proliferation of catfish and its probable impact
   within the mainstream flow-altered habitats where invasion resistance
   was possibly reduced. Comparisons of trophic niches provided information
   on its probable impact at different scales and the potential risk of
   invasion of tributaries inhabited by native minnow species. Copyright

   its trophic positioning relative to other fish community members,
   through stomach content and stable isotope analyses. Micropterus
   salmoides was a top predator in both dams. In the Mankazana Dam, it
   depended predominately on insect prey, demonstrating a generalised
   feeding strategy, with shifts to include increasing proportions of fish
   prey with increasing size. Contrastingly, in the Wriggleswade Dam, M.
   salmoides displayed no ontogenetic shifts and preferred Gilchristella
   aestuaria, likely indicating a shift to a predominantly fish-based diet
   at smaller sizes, in the presence of small pelagic fish prey. Overall,
   M. salmoides diet was opportunistic, likely associated with prey
   morphology and behaviour (associated with refuge availability) and

   human-dominated systems, offering unique opportunities to study
   individual adaptation to novel environments. One hypothesis for why some
   wildlife succeed in urban areas is that they are subsidized with
   anthropogenic food. Here, we combine individual-level movement patterns
   with diet composition based on stable isotope analysis to assess the
   degree to which a rapidly growing population of coyotes (Canis latrans)
   in Chicago consumes anthropogenic resources. We used telemetry to
   classify coyotes into three groups based on social class and home range
   composition: (1) residents with home ranges in urban nature preserves;
   (2) residents with home ranges that had a high proportion of urban land;
   and (3) transients that had relatively large home ranges and variable
   use of urban land. We found that natural and anthropogenic resources in
   this system can be reliably partitioned with carbon isotopes. Mixing
   models revealed that resident coyotes associated with most urban nature
   preserves consumed trace to minimal amounts of anthropogenic resources,
   while coyotes that live in the urban matrix consume moderate (30-50 \%)
   to high (>50 \%) proportions of anthropogenic resources. Lastly, we
   found evidence of prey switching between natural and anthropogenic
   resources and a high degree of inter-individual variation in diet among
   coyotes. In contrast to the expectation that urban adaptation may dampen
   ecological variation, our results suggest individuality in movement and
   diet exemplifies the successful establishment of coyotes in urban
   Chicago. Our study also suggests that direct anthropogenic food
   subsidization is not a prerequisite for successful adaptation to urban

   the origin and patterns of food production of ancient populations and
   the correlation of both aspects with demographic growth and social
   complexity. Some studies associated population growth with the shift
   from foraging to agricultural practices in hotspots on the continent.
   This association has been confronted by a number of studies performed in
   recent years that reconstructed dietary patterns for several tropical
   and subtropical areas of eastern South America. However, there is still
   a lack of information on the diet for Late Holocene populations in the
   wetlands of the Pampa Biome. In order to access the paleodiet of
   earthen-mound builders from southern Patos Lagoon (Brazil), this study
   combined bulk collagen stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes analysis of
   faunal and human remains with Bayesian Stable Isotope Mixing Models. The
   paleodiet of 20 human and one dog remains from six sites was
   reconstructed. The Bayesian mixing model on collagen 613C and 615N
   values revealed variable subsistence strategies with high consumption of
   marine/estuarine protein for some individuals. Other individuals' diets
   relied on terrestrial/ freshwater resources as protein sources. In
   southeastern South America, such patterns reinforce the resource-rich
   aquatic environment as a facilitator for the endurance of mixed
   economies. In addition, our results suggest that the Patos Lagoon

   changes over the four-decade history of the Rimov Reservoir (Czechia)",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,2021,755,2,NA,FEB 10,"Using archived fish scale samples together with long-term monitoring
   data, this study investigates the potential of fish scales to record
   historical changes in the aquatic environment. We analysed stable carbon
   (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes in the scales of two
   planktivorous cyprinid species collected from the meso-eutrophic Rimov
   Reservoir, Czechia, over its entire four-decade history (1979-2016). The
   delta C-13 of the fish scales varied greatly throughout the reservoir
   history. The lowest delta C-13 values were observed immediately after
   the reservoir was filled in 1979, indicating that fish production at
   that time was likely partially supported by C-13-depleted CO2 released
   from the inundated soil. During the 1980s, due to the high levels of
   phytoplankton production stimulated by high phosphorus inputs from the
   catchment, the delta C-13 values substantially increased. However, since
   1990, the delta C-13 values have generally decreased, reflecting a
   gradual reduction in reservoir primary production caused by the
   decreasing input of phosphorus and increasing input of dissolved organic
   carbon from the catchment. The delta C-13 of fish scales was also used
   to reconstruct the CO2 concentration of the surface water. The
   reconstructed CO2 varied significantly during the four-decade history,
   but it was always below the air-equilibrium concentration, suggesting
   that the surface water of the reservoir has consistently absorbed
   atmospheric carbon. The fish-scale delta N-15 values remained relatively
   stable, while slightly increasing within three years after impoundment,
   likely because the nitrogen supply was high throughout the studied
   period. Our study contributes to the growing body of literature
   demonstrating that stable isotope analysis of archived biological
   samples is a promising approach for understanding historical trends in
   the biogeochemistry of aquatic environments. In particular, our results
   highlight the potential of delta C-13 in archived fish scales in
   reconstructing carbon cycle changes and evaluating human impacts on
   aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Vasek, M (Corresponding Author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, Biol Ctr, Na Sadkach 7, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.

Article,Emma T. Nolan and Catherine {Gutmann Roberts} and J. Robert Britton,"Predicting the contributions of novel marine prey resources from angling
   and anadromy to the diet of a freshwater apex predator",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2019,64,8,1542-1554,AUG,"Anadromous fishes can be important prey resources for piscivorous fauna
   in lowland rivers. Freshwater anglers exploiting large-bodied
   cypriniform fishes use high quantities of pelletised marine fishmeal
   baits that can contribute substantially to fish diets. This
   marine-derived energy pathway also potentially provides a marine prey
   resource for freshwater piscivores. However, large-bodied cypriniform
   fishes are often in a size refuge against predation due to their large
   sizes. Stable isotope (delta N-15 and delta C-13) analysis assessed how
   novel marine prey resources influenced the diet of a freshwater apex
   predator, northern pike Esox lucius, in an impounded river basin (lower
   River Severn, western England). Up to three groups of prey resources
   were present: anadromous European shad (Alosa spp.), cypriniform fishes
   with dietary specialisms based on marine fishmeal baits, and freshwater
   prey. The availability of these prey resources to E. lucius varied
   according to river connectivity and levels of angling exploitation in
   different river reaches. Where the three prey groups were present, E.
   lucius were more enriched in delta C-13 values (range: -24.74 to -16.34
   parts per thousand) compared to river reaches where aspects of the
   marine prey groups were absent (range: -28.30 to -21.47). In all
   reaches, delta C-13 increased as E. lucius length increased. In the
   reach where all prey groups were present, the isotopic niches of three
   E. lucius size categories were strongly partitioned; this was not
   apparent in reaches where the marine pathways were unavailable. Stable
   isotope mixing models suggested that freshwater prey were the most
   important prey item, contributing between 42\% and 96\% to the diet of
   individual E. lucius. However, where present, anadromous fishes and
   cypriniform fishes specialising on marine fishmeal baits were also
   important prey items, contributing substantially to the diet of larger
   E. lucius (length > 650 mm). The total dietary contributions of the
   marine resources varied considerably among the individual larger fish
   (22-58\% of total diet). The presence of two marine resource pathways in
   a lowland river thus strongly influenced the diet of an apex predator,
   but with contributions being a function of their spatial availability,
   E. lucius body size and individual trophic specialisations. These
   results emphasise how the anthropogenic activities of river engineering
   and human subsidies can affect the trophic dynamics of apex predators.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Britton, JR (Corresponding Author), Bournemouth Univ, Fac Sci \& Technol, Dept Life \& Environm Sci, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England.

   worldwide. Understanding their impacts on organisms that use this zone,
   such as juvenile flatfish, is critical. By combining stable isotope
   data, digestive tract contents and community analyses of flatfish and
   their potential prey (benthic macroinvertebrates) from two North-East
   Atlantic sandy beaches (one impacted by blooms and one not), we detected
   similar and species-specific trophic changes among three co-occurring
   species (sand sole, plaice and turbot). Across flatfish species,
   juveniles displayed more opportunistic foraging behavior at the impacted
   site. Differently, plaice and sand sole relied more on the additional
   basal resource (Ulva spp.) than turbot. Finally, sand sole and turbot
   presented a stronger diet shift at the impacted site than plaice. We
   hypothesize that the species-specific response to the blooms are mostly
   driven by how the flatfish detect their prey (using visual and/or
   chemical cues) and when they forage (diurnal or nocturnal foraging).",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Jones, AG (Corresponding Author), INRAE, Ecol \& Ecosyst Hlth, ESE Ecol, Agrocampus Ouest, F-35042 Rennes, France.

   a Valuable Sport Fishery",TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,2016,145,6,1386-1398,NA,"Unintentional and illegal introductions of species disrupt food webs and
   threaten the success of managed sport fisheries. Although many
   populations of Burbot Lota lota are declining in the species' native
   range, a nonnative population recently expanded into Flaming Gorge
   Reservoir (FGR), Wyoming-Utah, and threatens to disrupt predator-prey
   interactions within this popular sport fishery. To determine potential
   impacts on sport fishes, especially trophy Lake Trout Salvelinus
   namaycush, we assessed the relative abundance of Burbot and quantified
   the potential trophic or food web impacts of this population by using
   diet, stable isotope, and bioenergetic analyses. We did not detect a
   significant potential for food resource competition between Burbot and
   Lake Trout (Schoener's overlap index = 0.13), but overall consumption by
   Burbot likely affects other sport fishes, as indicated by our analyses
   of trophic niche space. Diet analyses suggested that crayfish were
   important diet items across time (89.3\% of prey by weight in autumn;
   49.4\% in winter) and across Burbot size-classes (small: 77.5\% of prey
   by weight; medium: 76.6\%; large: 39.7\%). However, overall consumption
   by Burbot increases as water temperatures cool, and fish consumption by
   Burbot in FGR was observed to increase during winter. Specifically,
   large Burbot consumed more salmonids, and we estimated
   (bioenergetically) that up to 70\% of growth occurred in late autumn and
   winter. Further, our population-wide consumption estimates indicated
   that Burbot could consume up to double the biomass of Rainbow Trout
   Oncorhynchus mykiss stocked annually (>1.3 x 10(5) kg; >1 million
   individuals) into FGR. Overall, we provide some of the first information
   regarding Burbot trophic interactions outside of the species' native
   range; these findings can help to inform the management of sport
   fisheries if Burbot range expansion occurs elsewhere.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Klobucar, SL (Corresponding Author), Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, 5210 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.

   the broad-billed prion specialises in feeding on large copepods. We
   investigated historical trends in non-breeding distribution by analysing
   feather stable isotope ratios from a time-series dating back to 1926,
   and examined contemporary non-breeding distributions of broad-billed
   prions tracked using miniaturised geolocation-immersion loggers. After
   controlling temporally for the Suess effect, we found that the delta
   C-13 signatures of Antarctic prions, but not broad-billed prions,
   declined during the study period. This suggests a southward shift in
   Antarctic prion non-breeding distribution over the last century. Both
   species exhibited significant declines in delta N-15 during the same
   period, indicative of long-term decreases in marine productivity in
   their moulting areas, or changes in the trophic structure of prey
   communities. Tracked broad-billed prions migrated ca. 1000 km to an area
   east of the breeding colony where the Louisville seamount chain bisects
   the subtropical front. Topographically driven upwellings are stable and
   predictable features and may be crucial in aggregating plankton.
   Targeting seamounts could therefore mitigate the impact of
   climate-induced prey shifts by providing refugia for the broad-billed
   prion.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",Article,English,"Grecian, WJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet \& Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth \& Comparat Med, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.

   DEVELOPMENT OF A REGIONAL ECONOMY IN THE MOCHE VALLEY, PERU DURING THE
   EARLY INTERMEDIATE PERIOD",LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY,2012,23,2,144-166,JUN,"In this paper we test the hypothesis that an intensification of maize
   production preceded the development of a regional Moche political
   economy in the Mocha Valley of north coastal Peru during the Early
   Intermediate period (400 B.C.-AD. 600). To do so we analyze stable
   isotopic signatures of 48 bone apatite and 17 tooth enamel samples from
   human remains recovered from the site of Cerro Oreja, a large urban and
   ceremonial center in the Moche Valley. These remains date to the
   Guanape,Salinar, or Gallinazo phases and provide a diachronic picture of
   subsistence before the appearance of the Southern Moche state. The most
   notable patterns identified in the study include a lack of significant
   change in delta C-13(apatite) values from the Guanape to Salinar phases,
   followed by a significant enrichment in delta C-13(apatite) values from
   the Salinar to Gallinazo phases. Several lines of evidence, including
   archaeological context, dental data, and comparative carbon stable
   isotope data from experimental animal studies and studies of
   archaeological human remains support the interpretation that the
   observed C-13 enrichment in stable isotope values in the Gallinazo phase
   primarily reflects maize intensification. The stable isotope data from
   Cerro Oreja thus suggest that a shift in subsistence toward a highly
   productive and storable crop may have served as an important precursor
   to state development during the Early Intermediate period in the Moche

   change",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,2016,22,9,3233-3252,SEP,"Predicting how individual taxa will respond to climatic change is
   challenging, in part because the impacts of environmental conditions can
   vary markedly, even among closely related species. Studies of chipmunks
   (Tamias spp.) in Yosemite National Park provide an important opportunity
   to explore the reasons for this variation in response. While the alpine
   chipmunk (T.alpinus) has undergone a significant elevational range
   contraction over the past century, the congeneric and partially
   sympatric lodgepole chipmunk (T.speciosus) has not experienced an
   elevational range shift during this period. As a first step toward
   identifying the factors underlying this difference in response, we
   examined evidence for dietary changes and changes in cranial morphology
   in these species over the past century. Stable isotope analyses of fur
   samples from modern and historical museum specimens of these species
   collected at the same localities indicated that signatures of dietary
   change were more pronounced in T.alpinus, although diet breadth did not
   differ consistently between the study species. Morphometric analyses of
   crania from these specimens revealed significant changes in cranial
   shape for T.alpinus, with less pronounced changes in shape for
   T.speciosus; evidence of selection on skull morphology was detected for
   T.alpinus, but not for T.speciosus. These results are consistent with
   growing evidence that T.alpinus is generally more responsive to
   environmental change than T.speciosus, but emphasize the complex and
   often geographically variable nature of such responses. Accordingly,
   future studies that make use of the taxonomically and spatially
   integrative approach employed here may prove particularly informative
   regarding relationships between environmental conditions, range changes,
   and patterns of phenotypic variation.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Walsh, RE (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, 3101 Valley Life Sci Bldg, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.

   the ocean every year, but there are still fundamental gaps in how
   allochthonous OM is processed in the marine environment. Here, we
   estimated the relative contribution of allochthonous OM (allochthony) to
   the biomass of benthic and pelagic consumers in a shallow coastal
   ecosystem in the northern Baltic Sea. We used deuterium as a tracer of
   allochthony and assessed both temporal variation (monthly from May to
   August) and spatial variation (within and outside river plume). We found
   variability in allochthony in space and time and across species, with
   overall higher values for zoobenthos (26.2 +/- 20.9\%) than for
   zooplankton (0.8 +/- 0.3\%). Zooplankton allochthony was highest in May
   and very low during the other months, likely as a result of high inputs
   of allochthonous OM during the spring flood that fueled the pelagic food
   chain for a short period. In contrast, zoobenthos allochthony was only
   lower in June and remained high during the other months. Allochthony of
   zoobenthos was generally higher close to the river mouth than outside of
   the river plume, whereas it did not vary spatially for zooplankton.
   Last, zoobenthos allochthony was higher in deeper than in shallower
   areas, indicating that allochthonous OM might be more important when
   autochthonous resources are limited. Our results suggest that climate
   change predictions of increasing inputs of allochthonous OM to coastal
   ecosystems may affect basal energy sources supporting coastal food webs.",SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",Article,English,"Bartels, P (Corresponding Author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol \& Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.

   understanding of the role that migrating birds may play in spreading
   H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAD. Bird banding,
   traditionally used in studies of migration, is limited by low recapture
   rates. Telemetry can only be applied to larger species and a limited
   number of birds. We show that analyses of multiple stable isotopes
   (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta O-18 and delta D) can provide an
   understanding of the number of breeding populations represented at large
   congregations of wintering birds, probable locations of these breeding
   populations, and which breeding populations do not contribute migrants
   to a wintering site. As Asia is thought to be the origin of many HPAI
   strains and the center of their evolution, and as bird migration is
   poorly understood in this part of the world, we recommend that, in

   Nachukui Formation, West Turkana, Kenya",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,2016,371,1698,NA,JUL 5,"Reconstructing vegetation at hominin fossil sites provides us critical
   information about hominin palaeoenvironments and the potential role of
   climate in their evolution. Here we reconstruct vegetation from carbon
   isotopes of plant wax biomarkers in sediments of the Nachukui Formation
   in the Turkana Basin. Plant wax biomarkers were extracted from samples
   from a wide range of lithologies that include fluvial-lacustrine
   sediments and palaeosols, and therefore provide a record of vegetation
   from diverse depositional environments. Carbon isotope ratios from
   biomarkers indicate a highly dynamic vegetation structure (ca 5-100\%
   C-4 vegetation) from 2.3 to 1.7 Ma, with an overall shift towards more
   C-4 vegetation on the landscape after about 2.1 Ma. The biomarker
   isotope data indicate ca 25-30\% more C-4 vegetation on the landscape
   than carbon isotope data of pedogenic carbonates from the same sequence.
   Our data show that the environments of early Paranthropus and Homo in
   this part of the Turkana Basin were primarily mixed C-3-C-4 to
   C-4-dominated ecosystems. The proportion of C-4-based foods in the diet
   of Paranthropus increases through time, broadly paralleling the increase
   in C-4 vegetation on the landscape, whereas the diet of Homo remains
   unchanged. Biomarker isotope data associated with the Kokiselei
   archaeological site complex, which includes the site where the oldest
   Acheulean stone tools to date were recovered, indicate 61-97\% C-4
   vegetation on the landscape.

   into the belowground food web of an agricultural system. Plots were
   established and planted with maize (Zea mays) in a rye field (Secale
   cereale) near Gottingen (northern Germany) in May 1999. In October 1999,
   April 2000, and October 2000, meso- and macrofauna and maize and rye
   litter were collected in each plot and analyzed for C-13 and N-15
   content. N-15 signatures suggested that the soil animal species analyzed
   span three trophic levels with the trophic position of species varying
   little in time. The species investigated formed a continuum from primary
   to secondary decomposers to predators. On average, predator species
   differed from primary and secondary decomposers by 3.9 delta N-15
   suggesting that they fed on a mixed diet of both decomposer groups. The
   combined analysis of C-13 and N-15 signatures allowed us to identify
   links between prey and consumer species. In October 1999, shortly after
   maize residues had been incorporated into the plots, maize-born carbon
   was present in each of the animal species investigated, including top
   predators. The incorporation of maize carbon into the belowground food
   web increased during the following 12 months but the concentration of
   maize-born carbon never exceeded 50\% in any of the species.
   Furthermore, the ranks of the incorporation of maize-born carbon of the
   species changed little. The results suggest that the belowground food
   web relies heavily on carbon originating from plant residues from before
   the recent two growing seasons. In most species the amount of maize-born
   carbon increased continuously; however, in some species it decreased
   during winter, suggesting that these species switched to a diet based
   more on C3 plants during winter, or predominantly metabolized carbon
   incorporated during the last growing season. The study documents that
   the combined analysis of C-13 and N-15 signatures in soil invertebrate
   species, after replacement of C3 by C4 plants, is a powerful tool to
   better understand the structure of the belowground food web and the flux
   of carbon through it.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Scheu, S (Corresponding Author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Zool, Schnittspahnstr 3, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany.

   local populations' lives including dietary patterns. Stable isotope
   analysis has become a valuable tool for investigating paleodietary and
   paleomobility patterns in ancient societies using samples of human and
   animal skeletal remains from individual burials. This is an isotopic
   study of collagen and apatite from Iron Age Liburian burials seventh to
   first century BC from Nadin-Gradina, Croatia. Sixty human samples
   include 40 teeth and 20 bones. Fifteen individuals with paired tissues
   (teeth and bone) are used to explore differences between early and later
   life isotope compositions. Zooarchaeological remains from the site help
   approximate local dietary baselines of domesticated and hunted animal
   sources (n = 22 bones). Samples produced excellent collagen and
   uncontaminated carbonate yields to measure isotope ratios of carbon
   (C-13/C-12) and nitrogen (N-15/N-14). Overall, the dietary indicators
   are quite uniform, delta C-13 average -19.1 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand
   and delta N-15 average +9.8 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand for bone and
   almost identical values for sectioned crown and root tooth dentin. This
   suggests a consistent lifetime diet with strong reliance on C-3 plants
   such as wheat, oats, and other vegetables and that there was a moderate
   amount of animal protein, but unlikely including marine sources. This
   isotopically homogeneous dataset suggests that Iron Age hillforts and
   agricultural settlements in this region had relatively stable diets that
   were distinct compared with other nearby inland sites where millet was
   more prevalent. This research expands our understanding of a shift

   community structure and the origin of crustacean zooplankton carbon
   following additions of two different sources of dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), natural humic water and cane sugar, in two mesocosm experiments
   lasting 15-18 days. Experimental water with the natural plankton
   community originated from two boreal lakes in southern Finland having
   similar total organic carbon (ca. 11 mg L-1) and total phosphorus (ca.
   13 mu g L-1) content, but differing in total nitrogen content (ca. 1450
   and 440 mg L-1). The experiments demonstrated limitation of bacterial
   activity mainly by biodegradable DOC in the high nitrogen lake water,
   and by nitrogen in the low nitrogen lake water, which was also reflected
   in total pelagic energy metabolism and zooplankton productivity. DOC
   additions caused changes in the bacterial community structure, shown by
   length heterogeneity analysis of the PCR amplified 16S rRNA gene
   (LH-PCR). Cane sugar, differing in stable carbon isotope value (delta
   C-13 ca. -11 parts per thousand) from that of humic matter of boreal
   terrestrial vegetation (delta C-13 ca. -28 parts per thousand), proved
   to be a good tracer of DOC via bacteria to metazooplankton, especially
   in the nitrogen-limited conditions. Utilization of detrital particulate
   terrestrial organic matter by zooplankton was also evident, but it
   appeared to be a poor quality food. Our results show that an increased
   loading of allochthonous DOC to boreal lakes as predicted under future
   climate scenarios will not necessarily stimulate bacterial production
   and hence carbon transfer up the food web. Whether this happens will be

   (Thunberg), to Provide Potential to Enhance Biological Control for
   Aphids in Cotton",PLOS ONE,2012,7,9,NA,SEP 12,"Background: Biological control provided by natural enemies play an
   important role in integrated pest management. Generalist insect
   predators provide an important biological service in the regulation of
   agricultural insect pests. Our goal is to understand the explicit
   process of oviposition preference, habitat selection and feeding
   behavior of predators in farmland ecosystem consisting of multiple
   crops, which is central to devising and delivering an integrated pest
   management program.
   Methodology: The hypotheses was that maize can serve as habitat for
   natural enemies and benefits predators to provide potential to enhance
   biological control for pest insects in cotton. This explicit process of
   a predatory beetle, Propylea japonica, in agricultural ecosystem
   composed of cotton and maize were examined by field investigation and
   stable carbon isotope analysis during 2008-2010.
   Principal Finding: Field investigation showed that P. japonica adults
   will search host plants for high prey abundance before laying eggs,
   indicating indirectly that P. japonica adults prefer to inhabit maize
   plants and travel to cotton plants to actively prey on aphids. The delta
   C-13 values of adult P. japonica in a dietary shift experiment found
   that individual beetles were shifting from a C-3- to a C-4-based diet of
   aphids reared on maize or cotton, respectively, and began to reflect the
   isotope ratio of their new C-4 resources within one week. Approximately
   80-100\% of the diet of P. japonica adults in maize originated from a
   C-3-based resource in June, July and August, while approximately 80\% of
   the diet originated from a C-4-based resource in September.
   Conclusion/Significance: Results suggest that maize can serve as a
   habitat or refuge source for the predator beetle, P. Japonica, and

   Chukchi Sea sediments could have major implications on carbon cycling,
   carbon sequestration, and food sources for lower benthic trophic levels.
   The aim of this study was two-fold: (1) to identify the proportional
   contributions of organic matter from various primary producers
   (phytoplankton, terrestrial, and bacterial) to depth-stratified
   sediments (0-5 cm) across the Arctic Chukchi Sea shelf using essential
   amino acid (EAA) specific stable carbon isotope biomarkers; and (2) to
   experimentally evaluate sediment bacterial production under different
   temperature scenarios. Proportional contributions of EAA sources to
   surface sediments had little relationship with environmental variables
   across the Chukchi Shelf and only showed noticeably higher terrestrial
   proportions in surface sediments in a high-deposition region in the
   southern study area. Across all sediment depth strata, the majority of
   EAA in sediments (similar to 76\%) originated from terrestrial sources
   and may be indicative of accumulation over time due to slow degradation
   processes of this source within sediments. The different EAA sources
   showed no significant differences in proportional contributions with
   sediment depth except for phytoplankton-derived EAA, which decreased
   with increasing sediment depth. These patterns indicate a well-mixed
   upper sediment horizon, possibly from bioturbation activities by the
   abundant benthos. One EAA source assumed to respond quickly to changing
   environmental conditions are bacteria. To evaluate if and how bacterial
   production would respond to elevated temperatures, sediment bacterial
   production was measured experimentally using phospholipid fatty acid
   (PLFA) analysis. Bacterial production was initially (first 24 h) higher
   at 5 degrees C than at 0 degrees C; however, a drawdown of substrate or
   potential increase in predation activity and viral lysis resulted in
   bacterial production to subsequently be similar at both temperature
   settings. Overall results of this study suggest that terrestrial and
   bacterial carbon sources may become more prominent in a future, warmer
   Arctic. Identifying current patterns and potential shifts in organic
   matter sources with changes in temperature can aid in the understanding

   resource for the opportunistic kelp gull (<i>Larus dominicanus</i>) in
   Argentine Patagonia",AQUATIC INVASIONS,2020,15,"1, SI",140-159,MAR,"Introduced species are one of the main threats to biological diversity,
   but they can also facilitate native species through mechanisms such as
   trophic subsidy. We quantified the diet of breeding kelp gulls (Larus
   dominicanus) and their consumption of the introduced green crab
   (Carcinus maenas) at five colonies located along over 600 km of
   coastline in Patagonia, Argentina, and analyzed differences in
   consumption rates among breeding locations. Results based on pellet
   analysis (n = 961 pellets) showed that kelp gulls consumed green crabs
   during most or part of the breeding cycle at all study locations
   (0-73.9\%, depending on location, year and breeding stage). Green crab
   consumption differed among breeding locations, with lower consumption
   further from the reported location of first Argentinean introduction
   (Golfo San Jorge, Chubut, Patagonia) in 1999-2000. Despite kelp gulls
   regularly consumed green crabs at most breeding locations, this invasive
   species was not an important component in their diet. Both stomach
   content and stable isotope analyses from breeding kelp gulls indicated
   that the main prey were fish such as Argentine anchovy and Argentine
   hake (Engraulis anchoita and Merluccius hubbsi, respectively) and squat
   lobster (Munida gregaria). At Isla Vernaci Este and Punta Tombo, green
   crabs were found in only one stomach of all kelp gull age classes
   sampled (incubating adults (n = 42), young chicks (n = 75), and old
   chicks (n = 105)). Based on carbon and nitrogen isotopic values from
   blood samples from incubating adults (n = 54), Bayesian mixing model
   outputs showed that green crabs contributed 7.3-23.9\% to the overall
   diet. The study showed that the relatively recent introduction of green
   crabs supplements the available prey base of a widely distributed and
   abundant predator, the kelp gull, at least during its breeding season in
   a large coastal sector of central Patagonia. The extent to which the

   use in subarctic lakes",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2019,64,4,643-658,APR,"Climate warming and consequent greening of subarctic landscapes increase
   the availability of organic carbon to the detrital food webs in aquatic
   ecosystems. This may cause important shifts in ecosystem functioning
   through the functional feeding patterns of benthic organisms that rely
   differently on climatically altered carbon resources. Twenty-five
   subarctic lakes in Finnish Lapland across a tree line ecotone were
   analysed for limnological and optical variables, carbon (delta C-13) and
   nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope (SI) composition of surface
   sediment organic matter (OM) and fossil Chironomidae (Diptera) remains
   to examine environmental controls behind chironomid functional feeding
   group (FFG) structure and their isotopic associations for assessing
   ecosystem functioning and carbon utilisation. We hypothesise that the
   chironomid SI signatures reflect increased allochthony with increasing
   allochthonous input, but the resource use may be altered by the
   functional characteristics of the assemblage. Multivariate analyses
   indicated that carbon geochemistry in the sediments (delta C-13, delta
   N-15, C/N), nutrients, indices of productivity (chlorophyll-a) and lake
   water optical properties, related to increasing presence of OM, played a
   key role in defining the chironomid FFG composition and isotopic
   signatures. Response modelling was used to examine how individual FFGs
   respond to environmental gradients. They showed divergent responses for
   OM quantity, dissolved organic carbon and nutrients between feeding
   strategies, suggesting that detritivores and filter feeders prefer
   contrasting carbon and nutrient conditions, and may thus hold
   paleoecological indicator potential to identify changes between
   different carbon fluxes. Benthic production was the primary carbon
   source for the chironomid assemblages according to a three-source SI
   mixing model, whereas pelagic and terrestrial components contributed
   less. Between-lake variability in source utilisation was high and
   controlled primarily by allochthonous OM inputs. Combination of
   biogeochemical modelling and functional classification is useful to
   widen our understanding of subarctic lake ecosystem functions and
   responses to climate-driven changes in limnology and catchment
   characteristics for long-term environmental change assessments and
   functional paleoecology.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Kivilä, EH (Corresponding Author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol \& Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla, Finland.

   evidence of recent human impact to oceanic food webs","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA",2013,110,22,8972-8977,MAY 28,"Human exploitation of marine ecosystems is more recent in oceanic than
   near shore regions, yet our understanding of human impacts on oceanic
   food webs is comparatively poor. Few records of species that live beyond
   the continental shelves date back more than 60 y, and the sheer size of
   oceanic regions makes their food webs difficult to study, even in modern
   times. Here, we use stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes to study the
   foraging history of a generalist, oceanic predator, the Hawaiian petrel
   (Pterodroma sandwichensis), which ranges broadly in the Pacific from the
   equator to near the Aleutian Islands. Our isotope records from modern
   and ancient, radiocarbon-dated bones provide evidence of over 3,000 y of
   dietary stasis followed by a decline of ca. 1.8 parts per thousand in
   delta N-15 over the past 100 y. Fishery-induced trophic decline is the
   most likely explanation for this sudden shift, which occurs in
   genetically distinct populations with disparate foraging locations. Our
   isotope records also show that coincident with the apparent decline in
   trophic level, foraging segregation among petrel populations decreased
   markedly. Because variation in the diet of generalist predators can
   reflect changing availability of their prey, a foraging shift in
   wide-ranging Hawaiian petrel populations suggests a relatively rapid
   change in the composition of oceanic food webs in the Northeast Pacific.
   Understanding and mitigating widespread shifts in prey availability may
   be a critical step in the conservation of endangered marine predators
   such as the Hawaiian petrel.",NATL ACAD SCIENCES,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",Article,English,"Wiley, AE (Corresponding Author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.

   insecticide use and the presence of certain agricultural pests, thus
   improving food and environmental safety. Nevertheless, effects of GM
   plant residues on the soil food web are still poorly understood. Zea
   mays L., enriched with a gene from Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner
   subsp. kurstaki (Bt) as a defence against the maize borer, is widely
   cultivated. In this study, we explored the invertebrate food webs
   associated with residues of Bt and non-Bt maize, respectively
   represented by DKC6575, with a Cry1Ab transgene (event MON810), and its
   near-isogenic Tietar variety, in a five-month field experiment. C and N
   stable isotopes and Bayesian mixing models were used to assess trophic
   niche metrics and track nutrient flows from maize residues and weeds
   occurring in maize crops to invertebrate detritivores and predators.
   While there were no initial differences in the structural components of
   maize residues between varieties, after five months of exposure in the
   field, the lignin content was higher and the organic matter content was
   lower in non-Bt than in Bt maize. Organic matter depletion over time was
   associated with a decrease in primary consumer abundance and an increase
   in their trophic niche width in both Bt and non-Bt maize, but it was
   faster in the former. The abundance of primary consumers and predators
   was higher in non-Bt than in Bt maize, but the distribution of organisms
   across trophic levels differed between varieties, with prey availability
   being lower in non-Bt than in Bt maize. This allowed Bt-associated
   predators to maintain a diet based primarily on the maize food chain
   throughout the experimental period. In contrast, non-Bt-associated
   predators were more dependent on weed-feeding prey by the end of the
   experiment, increasing the coupling between the maize and weed energy
   channels in the soil food web. Some taxon-specific effects were evident.
   Less vagile organisms such as Diptera had a specific diet mostly related
   to maize regardless of variety and time, while the diets of more vagile
   organisms like Coleoptera and Opiliones changed the most over time.
   Overall, our results suggest that the attractiveness of non-Bt maize
   residues for invertebrate consumers is higher than the Bt variety,
   although the higher recalcitrant content following decomposition reduces
   it over time. The attractiveness also affects the movement of
   invertebrate predators (potentially including pest control agents) and
   thus nutrient flows in tritrophic detritus-based food webs in cultivated
   and uncultivated plots.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Calizza, E (Corresponding Author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Environm Biol, Via Sardi 70, I-00185 Rome, Italy.

   and Tobago (TT). The coastline of TT is highly complex, bordered by the
   Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Paria and the Columbus
   Channel, and subject to local terrestrial runoff and regional riverine
   inputs (e.g. the Orinoco and Amazon rivers). Coastal organisms can
   assimilate energy from allochthonous and autochthonous Sources, We
   assessed whether stable isotopes delta C-13 and delta N-15 Could be used
   to provide a rapid assessment of trophic interactions in primary
   consumers around the islands. Filter-feeding (bivalves and barnacles)
   and grazing organisms (gastropods and chitons) were collected from 40
   marine sites during the wet season. The flesh of organisms was analysed
   for delta C-13 and delta N-15. Results indicate significant variation in
   primary consumers (by feeding guild and sampling zone). This variation
   was linked to different energy Sources being assimilated by consumers.
   Results suggest that offshore production is fuelling intertidal
   foodwebs; for example, a depleted delta C-13 signature in grazers from
   the Gulf of Paria, Columbus Channel and the Caribbean and Atlantic
   coastline of 9 Tobago indicates that carbon with an offshore origin
   (e.g. phytoplankton and dissolved organic matter) is more important than
   benthic or littoral algae (luring the wet season. Results also confirm
   findings from other studies indicating that much of the coastline is
   subject to Cultural eutrophication. This Study revealed that ecosystem

   subsistence within a single city through time using stable isotope
   analysis of human and animal bone collagen. The diet and economy of the
   medieval city of Valencia (Spain) are examined over a 1000-year period

   stable isotope analysis of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15)
   was carried out on 67 humans and 47 animals sampled from several
   archaeological sites dating between the fifth and fifteenth centuries
   AD. Terrestrial C-3 resources dominated the diet in all periods.
   However, an increase in consumption of C-4 plants (e.g. millet, sorghum)
   and/or marine resources is detected among individuals dating to the
   Islamic period. Differences in the isotopic values of humans and animals
   between the three periods indicate a significant dietary diversity
   during the Islamic phases (eleventh to thirteenth century), compared
   with the earlier Visigothic phase (fifth-seventh century) and the later
   Christian phase (fourteenth and fifteenth century). Observed diachronic
   changes in isotopic results provide evidence for a shift in diet and
   subsistence, particularly during the Muslim and later Christian periods.
   This is linked with change in population and economic focus. Dietary
   diversity among Muslim individuals is hypothesised to indicate the

   dioxide to the atmosphere that are globally significant. Carbon exported
   from land (allochthonous) also supplements the carbon fixed by
   photosynthesis in aquatic ecosystems (autochthonous), contributing to
   the organic matter (OM) that supports aquatic consumers. Although the
   presence of terrestrial compounds in aquatic OM is well known, the
   contribution of terrestrial versus aquatic sources to the composition of
   OM has been quantified for only a handful of systems. Here we use stable
   isotopes of hydrogen and carbon to demonstrate that the terrestrial
   contribution (Phi(Terr)) to particulate organic matter (POM) is as large
   or larger (mean = 54.6\% terrestrial) than the algal contribution in 39
   lakes of the northern highlands region of Wisconsin and Michigan.
   Further, the largest carbon pool, dissolved organic matter (DOM), is
   strongly dominated by allochthonous material (mean for the same set of
   lakes approximately 100\% terrestrial). Among lakes, increases in
   terrestrial contribution to POM are significantly correlated with more
   acidic pH. Extrapolating this relationship using a survey of pH in 1692
   lakes in the region reveals that, with the exception of eutrophic lakes,
   most of the OM in lakes is of terrestrial origin. These results are
   consistent with the growing evidence that lakes are significant conduits

   fish, the trophic role of upstream migrating forage fish in freshwater
   ecosystems remains unquantified. We combined food web delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 analyses with fish biomass estimates to quantify estuarine
   resource contribution (from the ecologically significant Waituna lagoon)
   to the diet and growth of the apex predators, longfin eels (Anguilla
   dieffenbachii) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Waituna Creek,
   Southland, Aotearoa (New Zealand) during 2019 and 2021. Our results
   demonstrated that exceptionally high biomasses of large predatory fishes
   (610-830 kg km(-1)) were maintained in a degraded agricultural catchment
   through connectivity to a near-pristine estuarine lagoon. Inanga
   (Galaxias maculatus) migrating upstream from the lagoon supported
   60\%-80\% of longfin eel and 40\%-90\% of brown trout biomass over the
   two years sampled. Mass-balance modelling suggested that large predatory
   fish in the Waituna Creek consume about two tonnes of migrating
   whitebait annually. These findings highlight the wider role of
   estuarine/marine subsidies in structuring New Zealand freshwater food
   webs and challenge the orthodoxy of `restoring streams from the
   headwaters down'. Estuarine ecosystems may be more important than
   headwater areas for sustaining large predatory fish, such as longfin

Article,Eve Rioux and Jory Cabrol and Veronique Lesage,"Long-term evolution of the structure of the St. Lawrence (Canada) marine
   ecosystem in the context of climate change and anthropogenic activities:
   An isotopic perceptive",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2023,13,11,NA,NOV,"Documenting long-term changes in the trophic structure of food webs and
   how species respond to these changes is essential to forecast their
   vulnerability and resilience to environmental stressors. Over the past
   decades, the St. Lawrence marine ecosystem (Canada) has experienced
   major changes in its physical, chemical, and biological conditions from
   overfishing, acoustic and chemical pollution, climate change, and the
   increased abundance of some top predators. These changes have likely
   affected the trophodynamics of the ecosystem, and are suspected to have
   deleterious effects on endangered species of mammals and other
   components of the ecosystem, such as blue whales (Balaenoptera
   musculus), fin whales (B. physalus), and beluga (Delphinapterus leucas).
   This study examined the trophic structure of the St. Lawrence marine
   ecosystem, including the isotopic niche of various species, over two
   periods of contrasting pressures from anthropogenic and climatic
   stressors (1995-2003 vs. 2019-2021). Stable isotope ratios were measured
   in 1240 samples of 21 species of marine invertebrates, fishes, and
   mammals sampled during both periods. A significant change in the
   isotopic value and niche position between periods is observed in most of
   the sampled species. While the direction of change and effect size were
   not uniform among species, these changes confirmed that substantial
   modifications in community structure have occurred over time. Niche
   overlap decreased considerably among some of the pelagic and demersal
   fishes, and among whale species during the most recent period. Combined
   with a concomitant reduction in niche breadth in several species, these
   observations suggested that resource sharing was limited among these
   species. This study highlighted some degree of dietary plasticity in
   several species, and a long-term change in the trophic structure of the
   St. Lawrence marine ecosystem, with likely effects on diet composition
   and energetics of several populations, including endangered species.

   such as the Maryland Coastal Bays (MCBs) is derived from allochthonous
   and autochthonous sources. Little is known, however, about the
   contribution of terrestrially derived organic matter to SPOM in the
   MCBs. The sources of SPOM in the MCBs were evaluated using stable
   isotope ratios of nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13), and C/N
   molar ratios. The values of SPOM delta N-15, delta C-13 and C/N ratios
   from samples collected seasonally (July 2014 to October 2017) at 13
   sites ranged from -0.58 to 10.51 parts per thousand, -26.85 to -20.33
   parts per thousand, and 1.67 to 11.36, respectively, indicating a
   mixture of terrestrial SPOM transported by tributaries, marine organic
   matter from phytoplankton, and sewage. SPOM delta C-13 levels less than
   -24 parts per thousand, suggesting the dominance of terrestrially
   derived carbon, occurred mainly at sites close to the mouths of
   tributaries, and were less depleted at sites near the ocean. The mean
   value of SPOM delta C-13 was higher in October 2014 (-22.76 parts per
   thousand) than in October 2015 (-24.65 parts per thousand) and 2016
   (-24.57 parts per thousand) likely due to differences in river
   discharge. Much lower values (<4 parts per thousand) of delta N-15
   observed in February 2016 coincided with a high freshwater inflow that
   accompanied a major storm, indicating a strong influence of untreated
   sewage. Results from a two end-member mixing model suggest that on
   average, the SPOM in the MCBs is composed of 44\% terrestrial materials
   with the highest percent contributions in October 2015 and 2016 (61\%),
   and lowest (28\%) in July 2015. The contribution of terrestrial
   materials to the SPOM was highest (58\%) near the mouth of St. Martin
   River and lowest (25\%) near the Ocean City inlet. SPOM composition and
   distribution in MCBs are, therefore, a function of land use, freshwater
   inflow, and water circulation that influence in situ phytoplankton
   production, and the transport and distribution of terrestrially derived

   ecosystem",LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,2021,66,7,2810-2826,JUL,"Understanding the ecological interactions that enhance the resilience of
   threatened ecosystems is essential in assuring their conservation and
   restoration. Top-down trophic interactions can increase resilience to
   bottom-up nutrient enrichment, however, as many seagrass ecosystems are
   threatened by both eutrophication and trophic modifications,
   understanding how these processes interact is important. Using a
   combination of approaches, we explored how bottom-up and top-down
   processes, acting individually or in conjunction, can affect eelgrass
   meadows and associated communities in the northern Baltic Sea. Field
   surveys along with fish diet and stable isotope analyses revealed that
   the eelgrass trophic network included two main top predatory fish
   species, each of which feeds on a separate group of invertebrate
   mesograzers (crustaceans or gastropods). Mesograzer abundance in the
   study area was high, and capable of mitigating the effects of increased
   algal biomass that resulted from experimental nutrient enrichment in the
   field. When crustacean mesograzers were experimentally excluded,
   gastropod mesograzers were able to compensate and limit the effects of
   nutrient enrichment on eelgrass biomass and growth. Our results suggest
   that top-down processes (i.e., suppression of algae by different
   mesograzer groups) may ensure eelgrass resilience to nutrient enrichment
   in the northern Baltic Sea, and the existence of multiple trophic
   pathways can provide additional resilience in the face of trophic
   modifications. However, the future resilience of these meadows is likely
   threatened by additional local stressors and global environmental
   change. Understanding the trophic links and interactions that ensure
   resilience is essential for managing and conserving these important

   highly abundant crab in coastal habitats, may serve as important
   indicators of habitat condition. Here we investigated feeding patterns
   of Armases in coastal palm scrub forest to intertidal mangrove forest
   transition zones (transitions) as well as the relationship between
   habitat disturbance and Armases' trophic position across three pairs of
   geographically separated populations in Tampa FL, USA. Each pair of
   sites represented an unmodified ``natural{''} location as well as a
   ``disturbed{''} location lacking upland terrestrial palm scrub forested
   habitat. Laboratory experiments established a baseline understanding of
   feeding preference of Armases offered strictly mangrove material as well
   as sources abundant at the transition. In-situ feeding behavior was
   examined using MixSIAR mixing models with delta C-13 and delta N-15
   stable isotope tracers. Armases showed a strong preference for consuming
   partially-decomposed mangrove material from Avicennia germinans and an
   equally strong preference for Iva frutescens. Armases also displayed

   The rate of non-native fish introductions have more than doubled over
   the last decades yet the effect on natural ecosystems, in the scope of
   biologically mediated transport and biomagnification of Hg and
   Hg-isotopes, is unknown. Using geochemistry (THg) and stable isotopes
   (N, Sr and Hg), we evaluate natal origin and trophic position of brown
   trout (Salmo trutta fario), as well as mercury biomagnification trends
   and potential pollution sources to three high-altitude lakes. Farmed
   trout show Hg-isotope signatures similar to marine biota whereas wild
   trout shows Hg-isotope signatures typical of fresh water lakes. Stocked
   trout initially show Hg-isotope signatures similar to marine biota. As
   the stocked trout age and shifts diet to a higher trophic level, THg
   concentrations increase and the marine Hg isotope signatures, induced
   via farm fish feed, shift to locally produced MeHg with lower delta
   Hg-202 and higher Delta Hg-199. We conclude that stocking acts a humanly
   induced biovector that transfers marine Hg to freshwater ecosystems,
   which is seen in the Hg-isotopic signature up to five years after
   stocking events occurred. This points to the need of further
   investigations of the role of stocking in MeHg exposure to freshwater
   ecosystems.",NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Hansson, SV (Corresponding Author), Univ Toulouse, CNRS, INPT, EcoLab,UPS, Ave Agrobiopoley, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.

   season, sex, and body size",BMC ECOLOGY,2020,20,1,NA,JUN 3,"Background Resolving the preferred prey items and dietary proportions of
   leopard seals is central to understanding food-web dynamics in the
   rapidly-warming Antarctic Peninsula region. Previous studies have
   identified a wide range of prey items; however, due to anecdotal or
   otherwise limited information, leopard seal diets remain unresolved by
   seal sex, individual, body size, region, and season. Over the 2013,
   2014, and 2017 field seasons we collected scat, tissue samples (red
   blood cells and plasma; n = 23) for stable isotope analyses, and
   previously-reported animal-borne video from 19 adult leopard seals
   foraging near mesopredator breeding colonies at Cape Shirreff,
   Livingston Island. We summarized a priori diet information from scat and
   video analysis and applied a three-isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15,
   delta S-34), four-source (fish, fur seal, krill, penguin) Bayesian
   mixing model to examine temporal variability in both prey sources and
   leopard seal tissues. Results The austral spring diets of males and
   females focused on Antarctic krill (31.7-38.0\%), notothen fish
   (31.6-36.5\%), and penguin (24.4-26.9\%) and were consistent across all
   3 years. Several lines of evidence suggest the transition to summer
   foraging was distinct for males and females. Female diets transitioned
   rapidly to higher delta N-15 values (+2.1 parts per thousand),
   indicating increased consumption of penguin (29.5-46.2\%) and
   energy-dense Antarctic fur seal pup (21.3-37.6\%). Conclusions The
   seasonal increase in leopard seal delta N-15 values, and thus fur seal
   in their diet, was predictably related to larger body size; it may also
   be forcing reductions to the largest Antarctic fur seal colony in the
   Antarctic Peninsula. Our ensemble sampling approach reduces historical
   biases in monitoring marine apex predator diets. Further, our results
   are necessary to best inform regional fisheries management planning.",BMC,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Krause, DJ (Corresponding Author), NOAA, Fisheries Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Antarctic Ecosyst Res Div, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.

   seals",MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE,2013,29,4,E428-E447,OCT,"Determining how marine predators partition resources is hindered by the
   difficulty in obtaining information on diet and distribution. Stable
   isotopes (SI) of carbon (C-13/C-12, C-13) and nitrogen (N-15/N-14, N-15)
   provide a two-dimensional estimate of the dietary space of consumers; an
   animal's isotopic composition is directly influenced by what they
   consume and where they feed. Harp (Pagophilus groenlandicus) and hooded
   (Cystophora cristata) seals are abundant phocid species found in the
   North Atlantic. We measured and contrasted SI values between seals
   sampled at nearshore and offshore sites to test for effects of sampling
   location, sex, age-class, and body size to gain insight into how these
   species partition space and prey resources. In addition we contrasted
   previously published results for gray seals (Halichoerus grypus).
   Isotope values differed significantly by age class and location in harp
   and hooded seals. We found significant differences in SI values (mean
   C-13 and N-15 +/- SE) between all species. Hooded seals, a continental
   shelf-edge, deep-diving species, exhibited low SI values (juveniles:
   -20.9 parts per thousand +/- 0.03 parts per thousand, 13.36 parts per
   thousand +/- 0.05 parts per thousand; adults: -20.41 parts per thousand
   +/- 0.03 parts per thousand, 14.81 parts per thousand +/- 0.04 parts per
   thousand) characteristic of feeding on meso- to bathypelagic prey. Harp
   seals, which dive to moderate depths primarily on the shelf had
   intermediate SI values (juveniles: -20.53 parts per thousand +/- 0.01
   parts per thousand, 13.91 parts per thousand +/- 0.01 parts per
   thousand; adults: -20.13 parts per thousand +/- 0.01 parts per thousand,
   14.96 parts per thousand +/- 0.01 parts per thousand) characteristic of
   feeding on epipelagic prey, whereas gray seals, which feed on or near
   the sea floor in shallow shelf waters, had high SI values (juveniles:
   -19.74 parts per thousand +/- 0.04 parts per thousand, 17.51 parts per
   thousand +/- 0.05 parts per thousand; adults: -18.86 parts per thousand
   +/- 0.01 parts per thousand, 17.23 parts per thousand +/- 0.02 parts per
   thousand) characteristic of feeding on demersal prey. In all species,
   C-13 values increased with body size and age in the same manner,
   indicating that seals exploit or forage in deeper habitats as they get
   larger and older. We hypothesize that the consistent ontogenetic shift
   in foraging niche, despite large differences between species in their
   diving behavior, geographic range and habitat use, not only reflects
   increased access to different prey due to increased diving capacity, but
   a progressive adjustment to balance energy budgets by reducing foraging

   composition of archived material have a great potential for describing
   past effects of anthropogenic ecosystem alterations or natural shifts in
   ecosystems. In this study, we examined the effects of two commonly used
   preservation substances of freshwater invertebrates, ethanol and lugol,
   on delta C-13 and delta N-15 of various planktonic and benthic taxa. For
   both isotopes, the average effect of fixation in ethanol was stronger
   than in lugol, and the effects on delta C-13 were stronger than on delta
   N-15 (average +/- SD: 1.18 +/- 0.94 and -0.47 +/- 0.99 for delta C-13
   ethanol and lugol fixed samples, respectively, and 0.39 +/- 0.68 and
   0.17 +/- 0.77 for delta N-15, respectively). The changes in the isotopic
   composition were not dependent on the initial isotopic composition of
   each taxon, but were related with concomitant changes in the carbon or
   nitrogen content. Application of a mass balance correction equation to
   the fixed samples resulted in a significantly lower average effect of
   fixation in ethanol (0.01 +/- 0.59 and 0.44 +/- 0.65 for delta N-15 and
   delta C-13, respectively), while corrections had little effect for lugol
   fixed samples (0.24 +/- 0.53 and -0.39 +/- 0.85, respectively). For both
   isotopes and fixatives, corrections resulted in linear relationships
   between fixed vs. control samples, with slopes and intercepts not
   significantly different from 1 and 0, respectively. Therefore, mass
   balance correction of stable isotopes in fixed invertebrates is

   animals. The diet and trophic position of Rattus rattus introduced on
   Ile de la Possession (Iles Crozet) was assessed from two sites,

   three complementary assays: macroanalyses of the stomach, faecal
   microhistology, and stable isotope analyses of delta N-15/delta C-13 in
   liver. Near the rookery, spermatophytes contributed on average 50\%
   (confidential interval: 23-75) to the diet based on isotopes, mainly
   consisting in reproductive parts of Poa spp., Agrostis magellanica, and
   Cerastium fontanum identified in faeces. Terrestrial animal preys were
   represented by insects that contributed 25\% (0-56) in isotopes,
   dominated in faeces by caterpillars of Pringleophaga spp. and adult
   weevils. Bird remains were found in faeces, forming 18\% (6-30) of
   isotopes. Terrestrial earthworms contributed to 7\% (0-21), with chaetae
   observed in faeces. On the other site, spermatophytes represented 62\%

   and Acaena magellanica, insects by caterpillars {[}24\% (10-39)], and
   terrestrial earthworms {[}13\% (2-23)]. Our results suggest that rats,
   which were found at the top of terrestrial food chains, may have a
   direct role on a such simplified ecosystem, by preying on the most
   abundant and largest body-sized terrestrial invertebrates,-e.g. the
   keystone species Pringleophaga spp.-, and by feeding on both
   reproductive and vegetative parts of autochthonous and introduced

   surface waters. Benthic invertebrates (ophiuroids, polychaetes) and
   sediments had high proportions of diatom-associated FAs in their lipid
   composition. H-Print estimates of the proportional contributions of sea
   icederived carbon to the carbon pool of the benthic community were
   substantial, ranging on average between 77 and 85\%. High carbon stable
   isotope values (delta C-13) in benthic invertebrates and sediments
   (delta C-13: -19.6 to -11.6\%) further suggests that a large portion of
   the benthic carbon pool was of sea-ice origin, while surface waters were
   significantly lower (delta C-13: -22.32 +/- 2.17\%). In this ecosystem
   where landfast ice is present for most of the year, strong sea
   ice-benthic coupling emphasizes the dependency of the food web on ice
   productivity. As timing and magnitude of sea icederived carbon will
   change under alterations of climatic conditions and possibly with
   increased shipping activities in the study region, the adaptive capacity
   of sea ice-dependent species is anticipated to play a key role in
   determining future food webs.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",Article,English,"Kohlbach, D (Corresponding Author), Fisheries \& Oceans Canada, Freshwater Inst, 501 Univ Crescent, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N6, Canada.

   northern Bering and Chukchi seas, specifically in biologically
   productive ``hotspots{''} within the Distributed Biological Observatory
   (DBO) program. The stable nitrogen isotope composition of
   compound-specific amino acids (delta N-15(AA)) was used as an approach
   to assess how several benthic species in this Arctic ecosystem are
   responding to the earlier timing of sea-ice melt and associated shifts
   to the onset of the annual production season. The trophic level of 16
   common benthic taxa with different feeding behaviors were collected
   along a south-to-north latitudinal gradient extending from the northern
   Bering Sea, south of St. Lawrence Island, to the northern Chukchi Sea,
   including the Barrow Canyon undersea feature, and examined with respect
   to the available food sources. The delta N-15(AA) values of source and
   trophic amino acids varied among studied regions and among species.
   delta N-15(AA)-based trophic level estimations, using delta N-15 values
   in both source and trophic amino acids and the measure of heterotrophic
   resynthesis (Sigma V parameter), provided new insights on trophic levels
   and feeding behaviors of different taxonomic groups that were not
   apparent from more commonly used isotopic measurements of bulk tissues.
   The compound-specific amino acid isotope compositions varied
   geographically, but not necessarily by latitude. This indicates that a
   simple time for space replacement perspective extending from south to
   north over the study area and reflecting variable persistence of
   seasonal sea ice, is inadequate to explain food web complexity. Highest
   bulk delta N-15 and delta N-15(AA) values were observed in depositional
   zones (near and within the St. Lawrence Island Winter-Spring Polynya, in
   particular). The delta N-15(AA) values also suggested high feeding
   plasticity in benthic species in the northern Bering and Chukchi seas
   hotspots. Benthic consumers most likely can change feeding behavior
   (e.g. suspension versus deposit feeding) in response to different
   environmental conditions and resulting changes in the quality of organic
   matter reaching the sea floor. We conclude that the sensitivity of
   productive arctic benthic ecosystems to climate related change, i.e.
   earlier sea-ice melt and related onset of primary production, might be
   mitigated by robust capabilities to adapt to changes in food quality and

   permafrost degradation, and altered precipitation patterns can have
   profound effects on contaminants, such as mercury (Hg), in High Arctic
   lakes. Two physically similar lakes, East Lake and West Lake at the Cape
   Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory on Melville Island, Nunavut, Canada
   are being affected by climate change differently. Both lakes have
   experienced permafrost degradation in their catchments; however, West
   Lake has also undergone multiple underwater Mass Movement Events (MMEs;
   beginning in fall 2008), leading to a sustained 50-fold increase in
   turbidity. This provided the unique opportunity to understand the
   potential impacts of permafrost degradation and other climate-related
   effects on Hg concentrations and body condition of landlocked Arctic
   char (Salvelinus alpinus), an important sentinel species across the
   Circum-Arctic. Our objectives were to assess temporal trends in char Hg
   concentrations and to determine potential mechanisms driving the trends.
   There was a significant decrease in Hg concentrations in East Lake char,
   averaging 6.5\%/year and 3.8\%/year for length-adjusted and age-adjusted
   means, respectively, from 2008 to 2019. Conversely, in West Lake there
   was a significant increase, averaging 7.9\%/year and 8.0\%/year for
   length-adjusted and age-adjusted mean Hg concentrations, respectively,
   for 2009 to 2017 (the last year with sufficient sample size). The best
   predictors of length-adjusted Hg concentrations in West Lake were carbon
   and nitrogen stable isotope ratios, indicating a shift in diet including
   possible dietary starvation brought on by the profound increase in lake
   turbidity. Our study provides an example of how increasing lake
   turbidity, a likely consequence of climate warming in Arctic lakes, may
   influence fish condition and Hg concentrations. Environ Toxicol Chem

   Canada, have changed from the Pleistocene (>52.8 ka BP to 26.5 ka BP
   {[}+/- 170 y BP]) to the recent Holocene (1960s) using dental microwear
   analysis of carnassial teeth and stable isotope analyses of carbonates
   (delta C-13(CO3) and delta O-18(CO3)) and collagen (delta C-13(col) and
   delta N-15(col)) from bone. We find that dental microwear patterns are
   similar between the Pleistocene and Holocene specimens, indicating that
   there has been no change in carcass utilization behaviours, where flesh,
   not bone, is primarily consumed. Based on minimal changes in delta
   C-13(CO3) and delta C-13(col) values, we find that, over thousands of
   years, Yukon gray wolves have remained generalist predators feeding upon
   several large ungulate species. Interestingly, delta N-15(col) values
   suggest that the extinction of megafaunal species at similar to 11.7 Ka
   induced a shift from a diet comprised primarily of horse (Equus sp.) to
   one based on cervids (i.e. moose and caribou). Survival of large-bodied
   cervids, such as caribou (Rangifer tarandus), was likely key to wolf
   survival. Although gray wolves survived the end Pleistocene megafauna
   extinction and demonstrate a degree of ecological flexibility, we
   suggest that failure to preserve major elements of their current niche

   Marine Ecosystems: Confirmations from the Past",PLOS ONE,2014,9,7,NA,JUL 30,"The human exploitation of marine resources is characterised by the
   preferential removal of the largest species. Although this is expected
   to modify the structure of food webs, we have a relatively poor
   understanding of the potential consequences of such alteration. Here, we
   take advantage of a collection of ancient consumer tissues, using stable
   isotope analysis and SIBER to assess changes in the structure of coastal
   marine food webs in the South-western Atlantic through the second half
   of the Holocene as a result of the sequential exploitation of marine
   resources by hunter-gatherers, western sealers and modern fishermen.
   Samples were collected from shell middens and museums. Shells of both
   modern and archaeological intertidal herbivorous molluscs were used to
   reconstruct changes in the stable isotopic baseline, while modern and
   archaeological bones of the South American sea lion Otaria flavescens,
   South American fur seal Arctocephalus australis and Magellanic penguin
   Spheniscus magellanicus were used to analyse changes in the structure of
   the community of top predators. We found that ancient food webs were
   shorter, more redundant and more overlapping than current ones, both in
   northern-central Patagonia and southern Patagonia. These surprising
   results may be best explained by the huge impact of western sealing on
   pinnipeds during the fur trade period, rather than the impact of fishing
   on fish populations. As a consequence, the populations of pinnipeds at
   the end of the sealing period were likely well below the ecosystem's
   carrying capacity, which resulted in a release of intraspecific
   competition and a shift towards larger and higher trophic level prey.

Trueman,"Tracking, feather moult and stable isotopes reveal foraging behaviour of
   a critically endangered seabird during the non-breeding season",DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,2017,23,2,130-145,FEB,"Aim The movement patterns of marine top predators are likely to reflect
   responses to prey distributions, which themselves can be influenced by
   factors such as climate and fisheries. The critically endangered
   Balearic shearwater Puffinus mauretanicus has shown a recent northwards
   shift in non-breeding distribution, tentatively linked to changing
   forage fish distribution and/or fisheries activity. Here, we provide the
   first information on the foraging ecology of this species during the
   non-breeding period.
   Location Breeding grounds in Mallorca, Spain, and non-breeding areas in
   the north-east Atlantic and western Mediterranean.
   Methods Birdborne geolocation was used to identify non-breeding grounds.
   Information on feather moult (from digital images) and stable isotopes
   (of both primary wing feathers and potential prey items) was combined to
   infer foraging behaviour during the non-breeding season.
   Results Almost all breeding shearwaters (n = 32) migrated to
   non-breeding areas in the Atlantic from southern Iberia to the French
   Atlantic coast, where the majority of primary feather moult took place.
   Birds foraging off western Iberia yielded feather isotope ratios
   consistent with a diet composed largely of pelagic fishes, while the
   isotopic composition of birds foraging in the Bay of Biscay suggested an
   additional contribution of benthic prey, most likely from demersal
   fishery discards.
   Main conclusions Combined application of geolocators and stable isotopes
   indicates spatial variation in dietary behaviour and interactions with
   fisheries. Our results imply that both pelagic fish and fisheries
   discards are important components of diet during the non-breeding
   period, which may have implications for the at-sea distribution of this
   migratory species. These findings will contribute to bycatch mitigation
   in non-breeding areas and provide baseline data that should inform
   future assessment of seabird responses to changing fishery practices and
   prey distributions.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Meier, RE (Corresponding Author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Nicholson Bldg,Brownlow St, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England.

   stomach contents and tissue stable isotopes analysis",JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM,2014,94,6,1203-1220,SEP,"Common bottlenose dolphin (CBD) and bottom trawlers exploit the same
   ecological niche. The estimated CBD population along the Israeli
   coastline consumes roughly 1280 t of prey annually, similar to the mean
   annual trawl-fishery yield of 1300 t. In the ultra-oligotrophic
   Levantine Basin, the potential for competition for limited resources
   therefore exists. We aimed to examine whether the two consumers indeed
   harvest the same trophic level of the food web and the same members of
   that level. These questions were addressed by stomach content and stable
   isotope (delta N-15 and delta C-13) analyses. The database included 26
   prey-containing stomachs collected between 1996 and 2008 and muscle
   tissue samples of 23 dolphins and of 27 species of commercial fish and
   invertebrates for stable isotopes analysis. The 59.3 kg combined stomach
   content included at least 754 prey items, 97.3\% of which were fish,
   belonging to 22 identified species. About half (46.4\%) of the prey mass
   had medium-to-high commercial value. The overall similarity of the
   composition of the pooled biomass and that of the average commercial
   catch was expressed by a Pianka index of 0.49. Sparidae (sea bream) was
   the only family important for both consumers. The mean delta N-15 value
   of CBD muscle was found to be relatively low compared to other
   geographical areas and the estimated mean delta N-15 of its diet fell
   below that of most commercial species tested. Our findings suggest that
   CBD and the fisheries only partly share resources, with CBD having an
   overall minor effect on the bottom trawl fishery, mainly on the Sparidae
   catch.",CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",Article,English,"Scheinin, AP (Corresponding Author), Univ Haifa, Leon H Charney Sch Marine Sci, Leon Recanati Inst Maritime Studies, Dept Maritime Civilizat, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.

Article,Rocio Moreno and Gabriele Stowasser and Rona A. R. McGill and Stuart Bearhop and Richard A. Phillips,"Assessing the structure and temporal dynamics of seabird communities:
   the challenge of capturing marine ecosystem complexity",JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,2016,85,1,199-212,JAN,"1. Understanding interspecific interactions, and the influences of
   anthropogenic disturbance and environmental change on communities, are
   key challenges in ecology. Despite the pressing need to understand these
   fundamental drivers of community structure and dynamics, only 17\% of
   ecological studies conducted over the past three decades have been at
   the community level.
   2. Here, we assess the trophic structure of the procellariiform
   community breeding at South Georgia, to identify the factors that
   determine foraging niches and possible temporal changes. We collected
   conventional diet data from 13 sympatric species between 1974 and 2002,
   and quantified intra-and inter-guild, and annual variation in diet
   between and within foraging habits. In addition, we tested the
   reliability of stable isotope analysis (SIA) of seabird feathers
   collected over a 13-year period, in relation to those of their potential
   prey, as a tool to assess community structure when diets are diverse and
   there is high spatial heterogeneity in environmental baselines.
   3. Our results using conventional diet data identified a four-guild
   community structure, distinguishing species that mainly feed on
   crustaceans; large fish and squid; a mixture of crustaceans, small fish
   and squid; or carrion. In total, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba
   represented 32\%, and 14 other species a further 46\% of the combined
   diet of all 13 predators, underlining the reliance of this community on
   relatively few types of prey. Annual variation in trophic segregation
   depended on relative prey availability; however, our data did not
   provide evidence of changes in guild structure associated with a
   suggested decline in Antarctic krill abundance over the past 40 years.
   4. Reflecting the differences in delta N-15 of potential prey
   (crustaceans vs. squid vs. fish and carrion), analysis of delta N-15 in
   chick feathers identified a three-guild community structure that was
   constant over a 13-year period, but lacked the trophic cluster
   representing giant petrels which was identified using conventional diet
   data.
   5. Our study is the first in recent decades to examine dietary changes
   in seabird communities over time. Conventional dietary analysis provided
   better resolution of community structure than SIA. However, delta N-15
   in chick feathers, which reflected trophic (level) specialization, was
   nevertheless an effective and less time-consuming means of monitoring
   temporal changes.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Moreno, R (Corresponding Author), British Antarctic Survey, Nat Environm Res Council, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.

   due to the high fish consumption of the Amazonian population and the
   high toxicity of this metal. In the Amazon, floodplain lake
   hydrodynamics change considerably along the four seasons of the
   hydrological cycle (rising water, high water, falling water and low
   water), which can influence Hg bioaccumulation in fish. The main aim of
   this study was to evaluate if Hg biomagnification is influenced by
   seasonality in a floodplain lake (Puruzinho Lake) in the Brazilian
   Amazon. Additionally, the influence of food chain modeling on
   measurement of Hg biomagnification was tested. Hg concentrations and
   stable isotope signatures (carbon and nitrogen) were estimated in four
   species, Mylossoma duriventre (herbivorous), Prochilodus nigricans
   (detritivorous), Cichla pleiozona (piscivorous) and Serrasalmus rhombeus
   (piscivorous). The ``trophic magnification slope{''} (TMS) of the food
   chain composed by the four species was calculated and compared among the
   four seasons. There was no significant seasonal variation in TMS among
   rising water, high water, falling water and low water seasons (p =
   0.08), suggesting that Hg biomagnification does not change seasonally.
   However, there was significant variation in TMS among different food
   chain models. Lower TMS was observed in a food chain composed of
   detritivorous and piscivorous fish (0.20) in comparison with a food
   chain composed of the four species (0.26). The results indicate food
   chain modeling influences TMS results.",ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",Article,English,"Azevedo, LS (Corresponding Author), Univ Estadual Norte Fluminense, Ctr Biociencias \& Biotecnol, Lab Ciencias Ambientais, Parque California, BR-28013602 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.

   proportion to its presence in the landscape?",PEERJ,2020,8,NA,NA,FEB 19,"Examination of the feeding habits of mammalian species such as the
   African elephant (Loxodonta africana) that range over large seasonally
   dynamic areas is exceptionally challenging using field-based methods
   alone. Although much is known of their feeding preferences from field
   studies, conclusions, especially in relation to differing habits in wet
   and dry seasons, are often contradictory. Here, two remote approaches,
   stable carbon isotope analysis and remote sensing, were combined to
   investigate dietary changes in relation to tree and grass abundances to
   better understand elephant dietary choice in the Kruger National Park,
   South Africa. A composited pair of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper
   satellite images characterising flushed and senescent vegetation states,
   typical of wet and dry seasons respectively, were used to generate
   land-cover maps focusing on the forest to grassland gradient. Stable
   carbon isotope analysis of elephant faecal samples identified the
   proportion of C-3 (typically browse)/C-4 (typically grass) in elephant
   diets in the 1-2 days prior to faecal deposition. The proportion of
   surrounding C-4 land-cover was extracted using concentric buffers
   centred on faecal sample locations, and related to the faecal \%C-4
   content. Results indicate that elephants consume C-4 vegetation in
   proportion to its availability in the surrounding area during the dry
   season, but during the rainy season there was less of a relationship
   between C-4 intake and availability, as elephants targeted grasses in
   these periods. This study illustrates the utility of coupling isotope
   and cost-free remote sensing data to conduct complementary landscape
   analysis at highly-detailed, biologically meaningful resolutions,
   offering an improved ability to monitor animal behavioural patterns at
   broad geographical scales. This is increasingly important due to
   potential impacts of climate change and woody encroachment on
   broad-scale landscape habitat composition, allowing the tracking of
   shifts in species utilisation of these changing landscapes in a way
   impractical using field based methods alone.",PEERJ INC,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Marston, CG (Corresponding Author), UK Ctr Ecol \& Hydrol, Land Use Grp, Lancaster, England.

   through pristine tropical lowland rain forest, on the composition and
   structure of the resident anuran community in the Ulu Temburong National
   Park (Brunei Darussalam). One year after road construction, eight new
   anuran species had immigrated into the impacted area. Encounter surveys
   were conducted and radio-transmitters attached to a total of 16 frogs to
   identify habitat use and distribution of the largest (> 130 mm SVL)
   immigrant species (Limnonectes ingeri) in comparison with a similar
   sized resident congener. A strong preference for roadside habitat was
   found for the immigrant. However, several incursions of more than 500 m
   beyond the road into the pristine forest were also recorded. Over 200
   stomach content samples as well as stable nitrogen isotope ratios of 76
   individuals were used to assess the trophic ecology of the two species.
   Invertebrate diet composition did not differ. However, the immigrant
   species ate over 400\% more frogs than its resident congener and had a
   significantly higher delta N-15 ratio, indicating a higher position in
   the food web. This suggests that L. ingeri acts as a new top frog
   predator in the system and indicates that it may have a significant
   negative impact on the local anuran community. Overall, road
   construction in the absence of logging has led to the immigration of new

   bigeye tuna across the Western and Central Pacific Ocean",PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY,2017,154,NA,49-63,MAY,"Estimates of trophic position are used to validate ecosystem models and
   understand food web structure. A consumer's trophic position can be
   estimated by the stable nitrogen isotope values (delta N-15) of its
   tissue, once the baseline isotopic variability has been accounted for.
   Our study established the first data-driven baseline delta N-15 isoscape
   for the Western and Central Pacific Ocean using particulate organic
   matter. Bulk delta N-15 analysis on 1039 muscle tissue of bigeye and
   yellowfin tuna were conducted together with amino acid compound-specific
   delta N-15 analysis (AA-CSIA) on a subset of 21 samples. Both
   particulate organic matter and tuna bulk delta N-15 values varied by
   more than 10 parts per thousand across the study area. Fine-scaled
   trophic position maps were constructed and revealed higher tuna trophic
   position (by similar to 1) in the southern latitudes compared to the
   equator. AA-CSIA confirmed these spatial patterns for bigeye and, to a
   lesser extent, yellowfin tuna. Using generalized additive models,
   spatial variations of tuna trophic positions were mainly related to the
   depth of the 20 degrees C isotherm, a proxy for the thermocline
   behavior, with higher tuna trophic position estimates at greater
   thermocline depths. We hypothesized that a deeper thermocline would
   increase tuna vertical habitat and access to mesopelagic prey of higher
   trophic position. Archival tagging data further suggested that the
   vertical habitat of bigeye tuna was deeper in the southern latitudes
   than at the equator. These results suggest the importance of thermocline
   depth in influencing tropical tuna diet, which affects their
   vulnerability to fisheries, and may be altered by climate change. (C)

   understand contemporary species interactions, we quantified the isotopic
   niches, niche overlap, and ontogenetic niche change among seven dominant
   fish species using stable isotope analyses. Analyses used fishes from
   three regions differing in fish and prey diversities. Differences in
   fish and diet composition diversity among regions were found using
   Simpson's inverse diversity index. The regions of lowest diversities had
   higher instances of niche overlap and higher percentage of niche overlap
   area. The region of highest diversity had the widest spread of niches
   with greater distances from the community centroid. Ontogenetic shifts
   were observed such that larger individuals shifted towards the community
   centroid with the exception of Atlantic cod. Atlantic cod in particular
   was found to consistently be the top predator of the analyzed species.

   by largemouth bass in an agricultural pond with no available prey fish",JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY,2020,35,1,523-534,NOV 22,"The carnivorous largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides has been
   introduced to many regions and poses a threat to native aquatic
   organisms due to predation, resulting in a significant decrease in
   biodiversity. Under conditions of prey scarcity, the largemouth bass is
   thought to consume smaller conspecifics. However, little is known about
   this species' dietary reliance on intraspecific predation and its impact
   on the population structure. We investigated the length-frequency
   distribution of largemouth bass and estimated their reliance on
   intraspecific predation using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in an
   agricultural pond with no available prey fish. Almost all individual
   largemouth bass were collected via the pond drainage system. Within the
   largemouth bass population, the dominant length class was composed of
   fish measuring 100-160 mm standard length (SL), whereas few individuals
   measuring < 100 mm SL (first-year juveniles) were collected. The results
   from a Stable Isotope Analysis in R mixing model indicated that all four
   length classes (105-146, 165-180, 216-246, and 300-337 mm SL) of
   largemouth bass fed mainly on juvenile conspecifics and on red swamp
   crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). First-year juveniles could have been
   predated by other individuals of various sizes. The dominant 100-160 mm
   SL length class may have experienced a weak predation pressure when they
   were in the first-year juvenile class. Consequently, the largemouth bass
   population was unbalanced, with few first-year juveniles (< 100 mm SL)

   latitudes. The bioaccumulation and biomagnification of methyl mercury
   (MeHg) has serious effects on wildlife, and is most evident in apex
   predators. The MeHg body burden in birds is the balance of ingestion and
   excretion, and MeHg in feathers is an effective indicator of overall
   MeHg burden. Ivory gulls (Pagophila eburnea), which consume
   ice-associated prey and scavenge marine mammal carcasses, have the
   highest egg Hg concentrations of any Arctic bird, and the species has
   declined by more than 80\% since the 1980s in Canada. We used feathers
   from museum specimens from the Canadian Arctic and western Greenland to
   assess whether exposure to MeHg by ivory gulls increased from 1877 to
   2007. Based on constant feather stable-isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15)
   values, there was no significant change in ivory gulls' diet over this
   period, but feather MeHg concentrations increased 45x (from 0.09 to 4.11
   mu g g(-1) in adults). This dramatic change in the absence of a dietary
   shift is clear evidence of the impact of anthropogenic Hg on this
   high-latitude threatened species. Bioavailable Hg is expected to
   increase in the Arctic, raising concern for continued population

Kovacs,Niches of marine mammals in the European Arctic,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,2022,136,NA,NA,MAR,"The Arctic is warming rapidly, with concomitant sea ice losses and
   ecosystem changes. The animals most vulnerable to Arctic food web
   changes are long-lived and slow-growing such as marine mammals, which
   may not be able to adapt rapidly enough to respond to changes in their
   resource bases. To determine the current extent and sources of these
   resource bases, we examined isotopic and trophic niches for marine
   mammals in the European Arctic using skin carbon (delta C-13) and
   nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope (SI) compositions from 10 species:
   blue, fin, humpback, minke, sperm and white whales, bearded and ringed
   seals, walruses and polar bears, and dietary fatty acids (FAs) in polar
   bears, walruses and most of the whale species listed here. SI values
   showed clear species separation by trophic behaviour and carbon sources.
   Bearded seals, walruses and white whales had the smallest isotopic
   niches; these species are all resident High Arctic species and are
   likely to be particularly vulnerable to changes in Arctic ecosystems. We
   found clear separation between FA groupings driven by pelagic, benthic
   and planktonic/algal sources: pelagic FAs in all whales, benthic FAs in
   walruses, and copepod/algae/ dinoflagellate FAs in polar bears, with
   some polar bear compositions approaching those of the whales and
   walruses. There is strong niche partitioning between study species with
   minimal functional redundancy, which could impact Arctic ecosystem
   structure and connectivity if populations of these large nutrient
   vectors are reduced or lost.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"MacKenzie, KM (Corresponding Author), Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, Hjalmar Johansens Gate 14, N-9007 Tromso, Norway.

Article,Justin A. VanDeHey and David W. Willis and Jason M. Harris and Brian G. Blackwell,"Effects of gizzard shad introductions on walleye and yellow perch
   populations in prairie glacial lakes",FISHERIES RESEARCH,2014,150,NA,49-59,FEB,"Fisheries managers often stock prey fish to increase abundance and
   growth of predatory sport fishes. One species commonly used in the U.S.
   Midwest is gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum; gizzard shad have been used
   to increase growth and condition of walleye Sander vitreus in many
   Midwestern systems. Additionally, with warming climates and stocking,
   gizzard shad are experiencing a natural range expansion. While this
   expansion may be beneficial for top predators like walleye, mixed
   results exist on the effects of gizzard shad on other recreationally
   important fishes in these systems. Our objectives were to determine if
   annual growth, relative abundance, and condition of yellow perch, Perca
   flavescens and walleye populations changed following the introduction of
   gizzard shad. Adult, pre-spawn gizzard shad were introduced in 2008 and
   2009 at densities higher than those which resulted in self-sustaining
   populations in other South Dakota reservoirs. Yellow perch and walleye
   population dynamics were estimated during 2007 (pre-shad), 2008-2009
   (shad present) and 2010 (post-shad) in two glacial lakes stocked with
   adult gizzard shad and a reference lake (not stocked with shad). Our
   results suggest that at the densities documented in this study and in
   the time frame assessed, gizzard shad did not negatively impact yellow
   perch as total length at age was similar, condition remained high and
   zooplankton resources were likely not limiting. Walleye did consume
   gizzard shad when available and shad appeared to have a neutral or
   positive effect on walleye growth, relative abundance and condition in
   these systems during this study. The addition of shad may be a viable
   option to improve walleye populations without negatively impacting
   sympatric yellow perch populations under the conditions tested in this
   study. However, the introduction of a non-indigenous species should be
   done with caution, especially a potential competitor like gizzard shad.

   can constitute an energetic subsidy to food webs in nearshore coastal
   areas. In regions with distinctly seasonal rainfall patterns, the
   strength and spatial footprint of any terrestrial signal in receiving
   marine food webs is predicted to mirror seasonal changes in fluvial
   forcing. Here, we test this prediction in a subtropical bay by
   isotopically (C-13 and N-15) characterizing the main primary producers
   and reconstructing (using a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model) their
   contributions to the diet of thinstripe hermit crabs (Clibanarius
   vittatus). Seasonal rainfall flushed terrestrial carbon out of coastal
   watersheds, and this material made a sizable (up to 28\%) contribution
   to the diet of marine consumers, in addition to mangroves, seagrass and
   algae. Our isotope model indicates that inputs of terrestrial grasses
   and other littoral vegetation were 15\% greater as a result of increased
   fluvial forcing. In addition, the spatial footprint of the terrestrial
   signal in marine consumers propagated more widely throughout the bay
   during high-rainfall periods. Given the widespread conversion of natural
   watershed habitats for agriculture and urban development, understanding
   the nature, temporal dynamics and strength of such land-ocean coupling

   ecosystems as indicated by neutral lipid fatty acid patterns",EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY,2020,81,1,103-115,MAY,"Shifting of trophic niches of soil microarthropods may allow them to
   adapt to changing resource conditions as induced by global change
   processes. However, the capability of microarthropods to shift their
   trophic niches is little studied. Whereas some studies based on stable
   isotopes (N-15/C-13) point to distinct and narrow trophic niches, others
   indicate that trophic niches are plastic. Here, we investigated shifts
   in trophic niches of oribatid mites (Oribatida, Acari), a major soil
   detritivore microarthropod group, due to forest management, i.e.,
   plantation of beech and spruce forests in Central Europe, using neutral
   lipid fatty acid (NLFA) markers. Due to differential microbial
   communities, we expected a fungi-based diet of oribatid mites in beech
   forest, but more bacterial contributions to the diet in spruce forest.
   Supporting these hypotheses, NLFA markers indicated that the trophic
   niches of each of the studied oribatid mite species differed between
   beech and spruce forests and shifted from feeding predominantly on
   litter and fungi in beech forest to more intensively feeding on bacteria
   in spruce forest. Oribatid mite species with the most pronounced
   differences in trophic niches included Achipteria coleoptrata, Eupelops
   hirtus, Eupelops plicatus and Liacarus xylariae, which had been
   classified as primary or secondary decomposers in previous studies.
   Overall, the results indicate that the ability of oribatid mite species
   to colonize different habitats and ecosystems is due to their ability to
   adjust their diet, i.e., to trophic plasticity. Changes in trophic
   niches in each of the studied oribatid mite species suggest that
   detritivores in soil may better cope with future changes in
   environmental conditions and associated changes in resource composition

   temperate lake ecosystem",OIKOS,2010,119,2,409-416,FEB,"Although some primary consumers such as chironomid larvae are known to
   exploit methane-derived carbon via microbial consortia within aquatic
   food webs, few studies have traced the onward transfer of such carbon to
   their predators. The ruffe Gymnocephalus cernuus is a widespread
   benthivorous fish which feeds predominantly on chironomid larvae and is
   well adapted for foraging at lower depths than other percids. Therefore,
   any transfer of methanogenic carbon to higher trophic levels might be
   particularly evident in ruffe. We sampled ruffe and chironomid larvae
   from the littoral, sub-littoral and profundal areas of Jyvasjarvi,
   Finland, a lake which has previously been shown to contain chironomid
   larvae exhibiting the very low stable carbon isotope ratios indicative
   of methane exploitation. A combination of Fish gut content examination
   and stable isotope analysis was used to determine trophic linkages
   between Fish and their putative prey. Irrespective of the depth from
   which the ruffe were caught, their diet was dominated by chironomids and
   pupae although the proportions of taxa changed. Zooplankton made a
   negligible contribution to ruffe diet. A progressive decrease in delta
   C-13 and delta N-15 values with increasing water column depth was
   observed for both chironomid larvae and ruffe, but not for other species
   of benthivorous fish. Furthermore, ruffe feeding at greater depths were
   significantly larger than those feeding in the littoral, suggesting an
   ontogenetic shift in habitat use, rather than diet, as chironomids
   remained the predominant prey item. The outputs from isotope mixing
   models suggested that the incorporation of in ethane-derived carbon to
   larval chironomid biomass through feeding on methanotrophic bacteria
   increased at greater depth, varying from 0\% in the littoral to 28\% in
   the profundal. Using these outputs and the proportions of littoral,
   sub-littoral or profundal chironomids contributing to ruffe biomass, we
   estimated that 17\% of ruffe biomass in this lake was ultimately derived
   from chemoauotrophic sources. Methanogenic carbon thus supports
   considerable production of higher trophic levels in lakes.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Ravinet, M (Corresponding Author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol \& Chem Sci, London, England.

   ungulates: competition- or physical environmental turnover?",OIKOS,2008,117,3,344-353,MAR,"Using long-term diet reconstructions spanning the past one million
   years, we contrast hypotheses that biotic interactions versus physical
   environmental changes are primary drivers of evolutionary turnover in
   mammals. We use stable carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18)
   isotope ratios in tooth enamel carbonate to trace herbivore niche shifts
   through the Late Quaternary Land Mammal Ages (LMAs) of grassland
   savannas in the South African interior (Cornelian-1.0 to 0.6 Ma;
   Florisian-500 to 10 ka; and Holocene/modern). Data reveal niche
   separation amongst closely related coeval taxa, and dispersals through
   time into empty niche spaces following extinctions. This suggests a
   primary role of competitive exclusion and niche displacement for
   speciation and extinctions in these early grassland environments.
   However, niche changes through time show a similar trend in many taxa,
   entailing increased delta C-13 (elevated C-4 grass consumption) from the
   Cornelian to the Florisian, and from the Florisian to the
   Holocene/modern, and elevated delta O-18 in Holocene/modern taxa that
   reflect global aridification around the terminal Pleistocene.
   Commonality in isotopic trends implies universal environmental forcing
   of ecological, and ultimately macroevolutionary, turnover. Yet some taxa
   shift from a mixed C-3/C-4 diet in the Florisian to a near-pure C-3 diet
   today. Indeed, we find that while delta C-13 data are normally
   distributed for Cornelian fossils, non-normal distributions characterize
   more recent time intervals. Such distributions are in line with the
   bimodal distribution of delta C-13 and diet in contemporary African
   ungulates. Thus, while environmental forcing did not, by necessity, lead
   to increases in C-4 intake, the results show changes from mixed to more
   specialized diets. We propose that this niche specialization was a
   function of long-term exposure to C-4 grasslands, consistent with
   predictions that relatively high metabolic demands of C-4 grazing in
   subtropical environments forced the differentiation of herbivores into
   one of two highly specialized feeding niches, i.e. C-3 browsing or C-4
   grazing.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Codron, D (Corresponding Author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol \& Conservat Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa.

   variation in arthropod populations can impact reproductive outcomes in
   these species. Arthropod populations in turn are influenced by climate
   because temperature affects survival and reproduction, and larval
   development. Thus, climate factors have the potential to influence many
   bird species during their reproductive phases. In this study, we
   assessed climate factors that impact the diet of nestling White-headed
   Woodpecker (Dryobates albolarvatus), an at-risk keystone species in much
   of its range in western North America. To do this, we measured stable
   isotope signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in 152 nestlings across
   six years and linked variation in isotopic values to winter
   (December-February) and spring (June) precipitation and temperature
   using mixed effects models. We also explored habitat factors that may
   impact delta C-13 and delta N-15 and the relationship between delta N-15
   and nest productivity. Last, we estimated isotopic niche width for
   nestlings in different watersheds and years using Bayesian standard
   ellipses, which allowed us to compare dietary niche width and overlap.
   We found that colder winter temperatures were associated with an
   increase in delta N-15 and delta N-15 levels had a weak positive
   relationship with nest productivity. We also found that sites with a
   more diverse tree community were associated with a broader isotopic
   niche width in nestlings. Our findings suggest that nestling diet is
   affected by climate, and under future warming climate scenarios,
   White-headed Woodpecker nestling diet may shift in favor of lower
   trophic level prey (prey with lower delta N-15 levels). The impact of
   such changes on woodpecker populations merits further study.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Lorenz, TJ (Corresponding Author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, 3625 93rd Ave SW, Olympia, WA 98512 USA.

   conservation and management, as well as for understanding the dynamics
   of underlying biogeochemical processes. We examined the effects of
   deforestation and subsequent afforestation of a riparian forest of
   Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) on stable isotope ratios of carbon
   (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) and natural abundances of
   radiocarbon (Delta C-14) in stream biota in the Mt. Gomadan Experimental
   Forest and the Wakayama Forest Research Station, Kyoto University,
   central Japan. Macroinvertebrates, periphytic algae attached to rock
   surfaces (periphyton), and leaf litter of terrestrial plants were
   collected from six headwater streams with similar climate, topography,
   and bedrock geology, except for the stand ages of riparian forests (from
   3 to 49 yr old in five stands and >90 yr old in one reference stand).
   Light intensity and delta C-13 values of both periphyton and
   macroinvertebrates decreased synchronously with forest age in winter. A
   Bayesian mixing model indicates that periphyton contributions to the
   stream food webs are maximized in 23-yr-old forests. Except for grazers,
   most macroinvertebrates showed Delta C-14 values similar to those of
   terrestrial leaf litter, reflecting the influence of modern atmospheric
   CO2 Delta C-14 values. On the other hand, the Delta C-14 values of both
   periphyton and grazers (i.e., aquatic primary consumers) were
   significantly lower than that of modern atmospheric CO2, and were lowest
   in 23-yr-old forest stands. Previous studies show that root biomass of
   C. japonica peaks at 15-30 yr after planting. These evidences suggest
   that soil CO2 released by root respiration and dispersed by groundwater

   clear-cutting and replanting of Japanese cedar is much slower (similar
   to 20 yr) than the chemical response (<5 yr). More than 50 yr is
   required for the food web structure to completely recover from
   clear-cutting. The ecological delay is attributed to several
   biogeochemical factors, the understanding of which is critical to
   integrated management of forest-stream continuum and the prediction of

   linkage with the late Silurian Lau/Kozlowskii Bioevent",PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY,2021,564,NA,NA,FEB 15,"The Ludfordian (late Silurian) records one of the largest perturbations
   in the Phanerozoic marine carbon cycling, the mid-Ludfordian positive
   delta C-13(carb) excursion (MLCIEcarb), which occurred in the aftermath
   of the Lau/Kozlowskii Bioevent (LKB). There are still controversies
   regarding origin of the MLCIE and its possible causal link (s) with
   respect to the preceding LKB. Surprisingly, the isotope fractionation of
   carbon between inorganic and organic carbon pools during the MLCIE was
   not investigated in detail. To constrain better this parameter of marine
   C cycle, its linkage to the LKB, and local sulfur cycle, we analysed
   high-resolution delta C-13(carb), delta C-13(org), and delta S-34(py)
   records in the Prague Basin (peri-Gondwana) representing one of the most
   complete records of the MLCIEcarb in the world. Evaluation of these
   high-resolution delta C-13(org) and delta C-13(carb) records reveals
   their tight coupling, which in turn indicates the photosynthetic origin
   of the MLCIEorg via links to primary production and changing rates of
   organic carbon burial. On the other hand, our data also reveal a
   short-term decoupling of the delta C-13(org) and delta C-13(carb)
   records preceding the MLCIE which may have been related to a purported
   increase in atmospheric pCO(2) levels or anoxic event. The peak of the
   Delta C-13 anomaly exactly coincides with the LKB and, therefore, for
   the first time suggests a tight link between the change in marine carbon
   cycling and the bioevent. Subsequent rapid drop of the Delta C-13 values
   (and by inference also atmospheric pCO(2)) fits well with a rapid
   cooling and globally documented regression reported for this time
   interval. Finally, the documented strong coupling of delta C-13(carb)
   and delta S-34(py) records during the MLCIE points to an intensive
   microbial sulfate reduction which should increase carbonate alkalinity
   input, thus contributing to formation of authigenic carbonates and an
   increase in delta C-13 values of DIC (and anticipated seawater carbonate
   saturation). The coupling of delta C-13(org) and delta S-34(py) values
   suggests a global enhancement of organic carbon and pyrite burial likely
   driven by an expansion of euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic water column)
   conditions in the oceans. Present study of C and S isotope variations
   during the MLCIE reveals for the first time a tight link among carbon
   and sulfur cycling, global cooling, and reorganization of faunal
   communities and fits well with purported seawater carbonate
   hypersaturation at the onset and during MLCIE.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Fryda, J (Corresponding Author), Czech Geol Survey, Klarov 3-131, Prague 11821 1, Czech Republic.

   Peninsula ecosystem",DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY,2018,149,SI,218-228,MAR,"The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) region is one of the areas under faster
   warming rates worldwide, and where food web changes have been observed
   in the last decades. Among these changes are the development of
   cryptophytes under warmer conditions in detriment of diatoms, and the
   reduced krill availability in the environment. An isotopic approach was
   used to investigate whether the temporal and spatial patterns of energy
   transfer from phytoplankton (using particulate organic matter - POM - as
   a proxy of primary producers) to baleen whales (humpback Megaptera
   novaeanglieae, fin - Balaenoptera physalus, Antarctic minke -
   Balaenoptera bonaerensis), and killer whales - Orcinus orca - is similar
   in areas under different effects of warming around the northern
   Antarctic Peninsula (NAP). Samples of POM (n = 65), krill (n = 29) and
   skin of baleen (n = 106) and, opportunistically, killer whales (n = 5)
   were collected in Gerlache and Bransfield Straits (western AP) and the
   Powell Basin (northeastern AP) during the austral summers of 2013-2016.
   Mean isotope values for delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were,
   respectively, -26.3 parts per thousand (+/- 2.9) and 0.9 parts per
   thousand (+/- 1.7) for POM, -25.6 parts per thousand (0.9) and 5.3 parts
   per thousand (+/- 1.1) for krill, -24.1 parts per thousand (+/- 2) and
   8.9 parts per thousand (+/- 1.5) for humpback, -24.6 parts per thousand
   (+/- 1.2) and 8.2 parts per thousand (+/- 0.7) for fin, -24.4 parts per
   thousand (+/- 1.6) and 8.7 parts per thousand (+/- 1) for Antarctic
   minke whales, and 23.6 parts per thousand (+/- 1.2) and 8.9\%0 (+/- 1.7)
   for killer whales. Interannual significant differences were found for
   delta C-13 values of POM and fin whales' samples, while spatial
   differences were found for delta C-13 values of POM samples and humpback
   whales and for delta N-15 values of POM, humpback and Antarctic minke
   whales. Lower delta C-13 and delta N-15 values for the base of the food
   web tended to be observed towards open sea regions (Powell Basin and an
   area under the influence of the Bellingshausen Sea waters). The
   isoscapes generated for the baseline of the NAP ecosystem provided
   unprecedented information, to the best of our knowledge, of how the
   delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of POM varied spatially and temporally
   in the region. HPLC-CHEMTAX pigment analysis indicated that two of the
   main phytoplankton groups in the study region were diatoms and
   cryptophytes. The contribution of these groups to the total
   phytoplankton biomass was positively and negatively correlated with the
   POM delta C-13 values, respectively. Despite the spatial and temporal
   limited interpretation of our results due to our reduced sampling effort
   to the east of the AP and to the relatively short temporal range
   investigated, the differences observed in the isotopic composition are
   considered representative of contrasting environmental conditions. The
   present study provides new insights on stable isotope values in the
   Antarctic ecosystem and may help to foresee the consequences of
   physico-chemical changes in water properties to the biota due to global
   warming.",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Seyboth, E (Corresponding Author), Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Inst Oceanog, Lab Ecol \& Conservacao Megafauna Marinha, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.

   rather than a shift to maize-reliance during prehistory. In addition, we
   compare and contrast our data with previously published work from other

   use, probably influenced by the political centres of Wari, Tiwanaku and
   later the Inka Empire. Contrastingly, results from incremental isotopic

   important in transferring energy to other trophic levels, habitat
   coupling, and helping to keep habitat stability. The study of this type
   of interactions in lentic systems is priority, since functional aspects
   about biological communities are unknown. Objective: Describing the
   trophic relations of aquatic invertebrates of the littoral zone in a
   tropical high mountain lake by characterizing gut content and stable
   isotope analysis of delta C-13 and delta N-15. Methods: Samples of
   benthic invertebrates were collected in the littoral zone of the Lago de
   Tota where Egeria densa was present using a handheld net method. Samples
   were processed in the laboratory, organisms were identified, counted and
   weighed. Gut contents and delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes
   analysis were performed as well. Results: Records of the trophic
   relations of aquatic invertebrates, which live in the littoral in high
   mountain lentic ecosystem in the Neotropics are shown. The analysis of
   gut contents distinguished seven food items, microphytes and MOPF were
   the most frequent, and through the stable isotopes analysis (delta N-15)
   we identified four trophic levels, among resources (macrophytes and
   POM), and consumers (detritivores, herbivores, and predators). The two
   upper trophic levels concentrated greater diversity and biomass.
   Conclusion: Most of the organisms studied were linked to omnivorous
   habits, evidenced in a wide spectrum of food items in their diet. The
   delta N-15 values show an enrichment, which occurs due to the effects of
   the tendency towards eutrophication of the system or due to unknown
   values of protozoa and bacteria that plays a fundamental role in the
   diet of these organisms, besides the delta C-13 values reported in
   organisms consumes, allows us to suggest an affinity with native

   respectively known as anchovies, sardines and sprats) collected across
   the western side of the basin. Our data allowed to determine the width
   and features of their trophic niches, to assess potential overlap or
   resource partitioning among them, and likely anticipate species
   adaptation to future climate change scenarios. Moreover, variations in
   stable isotope contents were correlated to both resource availability
   (i.e., mesozooplankton) and environmental variables. The high
   productivity and in turn the high resource availability of the basin,
   especially in the northern part, resulted in favor of the resource
   partitioning that occurs in each sub-area of the Adriatic Sea among the
   three species. Medium-sized specimens of the three species mostly fed on
   small zooplankton, while adult sprats relied on large copepods and those
   of sardines and anchovies also consumed large portion of phytoplankton,
   confirming the high trophic plasticity of these two dominants small
   pelagic species. However, considering that anchovies have the greatest
   degree of trophic diversity compared with the other two species, they
   could be the most adapted to changing feeding conditions. The increase
   in sea temperatures that are reducing primary production and in turn
   zooplankton abundances, coupled with even more frequent extreme
   meteorologic events could exacerbate the competition for trophic
   resources among pelagic mesopredators, and could lead to more notable
   stocks' fluctuations and unpredictable wasp-waist effects.",NATURE PORTFOLIO,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Article,English,"Fanelli, E (Corresponding Author), Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Life \& Environm Sci, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60131 Ancona, Italy.

   gryphus)</i> in Chile: Contrasting environments influencing feeding
   behavior",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,2020,741,NA,NA,NOV 1,"Human-dominated environments alter the availability and quality of
   resources for many species, especially for scavengers that have large
   home ranges and plastic foraging behaviors that enable them to exploit
   novel resources. Along the western slope of the Andes, the modification
   of natural landscapes have resulted in significant declines in native
   prey, the introduction of non-native species, and an increase in the
   availability of anthropogenic resources. These factors have likely
   influenced the resources available to Andean condors (Vultur gryphus),
   however, data are lacking as to how condor's diet vary along their large
   latitudinal range. We evaluated differences in Andean condor diet along
   a similar to 2500 km latitudinal gradient in Chile from the heavily
   modified Central zone (32-34 degrees S) to the more pristine Austral
   zone (44-56 degrees S). We assessed diet composition through the
   identification of prey remains in condor pellets, and carbon and
   nitrogen isotope analysis of condor feathers and their primary prey
   identified from pellet analysis. Our results identified medium- and
   large-bodied domesticated mammals (ungulates) and introduced exotic
   species (lagomorphs) as common prey across the study area. Condors from
   the Central zone had the largest isotopic niche width, probably related
   to consumption of anthropogenic resources with distinctly high carbon
   isotope values indicative of C-4-based foods likely acquired from
   landfills or corn-fed livestock. Isotopic niches for condors from the
   Southern and Austral zones almost completely overlapped. Andean condor
   diet is strongly influenced by local conditions determining differential
   access to prey sources. The high dependence of Andean condors on
   livestock across a large geographical area, and landfills in more
   (sub)urban areas, may help stabilize their populations via anthropogenic
   resources subsidies. Long-term dependence on such resources, however,
   may have health costs including contaminant exposure and greater
   mortality risk. These data will help identify potential threats related
   to resource availability and use, and better inform management and
   conservation decisions. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Duclos, M (Corresponding Author), Ctr Appl Ecol \& Sustainabil CAPES, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 340, Santiago, Chile.

   foodweb structures in an African subtropical temporary pool",AFRICAN ZOOLOGY,2020,55,"1, SI",79-92,JAN 2,"Southern Africa has one of the highest densities of temporary pools and
   some of the most understudied temporary wetlands in the world.
   Additionally, the eastern African annual killifishes (Nothobranchius
   spp.) are rare in southern Africa and found exclusively in temporary
   habitats. There is a notable lack of literature regarding the diet of
   these fish, as well as the foodweb structures of temporary ecosystems.
   The current study aimed to address this paucity in literature by
   assessing the foodweb of a temporary pool located in the Ndumo Game
   Reserve (NGR) in northern Kwa-Zulu Natal using stable isotopes analysis.
   In addition, Bayesian mixing models were used to assess the diet of the
   spotted killifish Nothobranchius orthonotus over two seasons (dry and
   wet seasons). The foodweb consisted of only three trophic levels and
   comprised different foodweb items between the two seasons. Stable
   isotope analysis indicated significant increases in delta 15N from the
   dry to wet season. It further revealed the diet of N. orthonotus to be
   more varied and omnivorous with primary producers contributing a much
   greater percentage toward their diet than previous studies have
   reported. This study contributes valuable information to the paucity of
   knowledge regarding foodweb structure and food-chain length of temporary
   pools in South Africa, as well as new insights into the extended diet of
   N. orthonotus. The analytical techniques used in this study could also
   be utilised as part of future research in ecological assessments of

   suggests changes in distribution but not trophic position since 1878",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,2021,678,NA,171-182,NOV 11,"Globally, human population growth, its associated pollution and the vast
   scale of industrialised fisheries are having negative impacts on oceanic
   food webs, affecting top predators such as seabirds. We used stable
   isotope (delta N-15 and delta C-13) analyses of feathers to investigate
   the contemporary structure and long-term changes in a near-shore
   community of 5 seabird species in northern Aotearoa New Zealand.
   Feathers were collected from museum specimens or live individuals
   (collected between 1878 and 2019) in Tikapa Moana, the Hauraki Gulf, a
   marine habitat increasingly threatened by overfishing and urbanisation.
   To tease out the effects of baseline ecosystem versus seabird
   distributional changes, we analysed muscle isotope values of forage
   fishes collected over 43 yr (1976-2019) and provide isotopic data from
   contemporary prey species sampled within the region. Contemporary delta
   N-15 and delta C-13 values were consistent with existing data on diet
   and foraging distribution of the 5 seabird species. Values of delta N-15
   declined in only 1 of 5 species studied, suggesting little change in the
   trophic position of the other species over time. However, delta C-13
   values declined in 3 species, and a lack of change in the delta N-15 and
   delta C-13 values of forage fish suggests that this change is reflective
   of a behavioural shift in the distribution of the birds. However,
   changes in isotopic baselines over the sampling period cannot be ruled
   out and require further investigation. Our results demonstrate the value
   of stable isotope analyses of contemporary and archived samples as a
   cost effective, non-invasive method for monitoring coastal seabirds in a

   and zooplankton in the Strait of Sicily (Central Mediterranean sea): a

   production, zooplankton community, and feeding behavior of fish species
   represents a key aspect to obtain a deeper knowledge of biological
   processes acting at ecosystem level. In this context, oceanographic data
   and biological samples were collected in two different surveys, carried
   out during late June 2011 and early July 2015 in the Strait of Sicily
   (Central Mediterranean Sea). Differences in abundance, biomass, and
   assemblage structure of zooplankton and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus
   Linnaeus, 1758) population were observed between the two surveys. Still,
   zooplankton biomass was significantly correlated to longitude,
   chlorophyll a recorded during the surveys (as a proxy of primary
   production), and oxygen concentrations. Such differences affected the
   isotopic composition of anchovy, which showed changes in delta N-15 and
   delta C-13 values between the two surveys. Mixing models identified
   different contributions of food sources in the two sampling periods,
   i.e., major consumption on large copepods and euphausiids in 2015 with
   respect to 2011, which was consistent with a greater availability of
   these preys in the environment in 2015. The obtained results evidenced
   that E. encrasicolus may be affected by any environmental change that
   influences the plankton community, which is the basis of the diet of
   these fishes. Such findings highlighted the importance to further
   investigate the trophic relationships among different compartments of
   the food web, as well as the possible environmental influences, in order

   that the shallow nearshore water provides disproportionately important
   feeding and breeding habitat for the whole-lake food web. We examined
   the trophic importance of the nearshore environment, human impacts
   nearshore, and several approaches to disturbance detection in a deep
   (190 m) oligotrophic lake with relatively modest residential
   development. In Lake Crescent, on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington
   (USA), stable isotope analysis demonstrated that apex salmonid predators
   derived more than 50\% of their carbon from nearshore waters, even
   though this nearshore water accounted for only 2.5\% of total lake
   volume. Unfortunately, it is this land-water interface that is initially
   degraded as shorelines are developed. We hypothesised that under these
   conditions of relatively modest disturbance, the effects of residential
   development would be strongly localised near to shore. Indeed, we found
   striking differences between developed and undeveloped sites in
   periphyton and associated organic matter, though there were no offshore
   signals of human impact in water nutrient analysis or paleolimnological
   investigations. Together, these results suggest that nearshore

   distribution and biomagnification",MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN,2013,77,1-2,437-444,DEC 15,"We conducted a large-scale investigation of methylmercury (MeHg) in a
   total of 628 marine wild fish covering 46 different species collected
   from the South China Sea between 2008 and 2009. Biological and
   ecological characteristics such as size (length and wet weight), feeding
   habit, habitat, and stable isotope (delta N-15) were examined to explain
   MeHg bioaccumulation in marine fish and their geographical distribution.
   MeHg levels in the muscle tissues of the 628 individuals ranged from
   0.010 to 1.811 mu g/g dry wt. Log(10)MeHg concentration was
   significantly related to their length and wet weight. Feeding habit and
   habitat were the primary factors influencing MeHg bioaccumulation.
   Demersal fish were more likely to be contaminated with MeHg than the
   epipelagic and mesopelagic varieties. Linear relationships were obtained
   between Log(10)(MeHg) and delta N-15 only for one location, indicating
   that biomagnification was site-specific. Results from this study suggest
   that dietary preference and trophic structure were the main factors
   affecting MeHg bioaccumulation in marine fish from the South China Sea.

   the sustainable utilization of ecosystem services through fisheries and
   other human activities under changing environmental conditions.
   Understanding of historical changes in marine ecosystems can help us to
   assess their current status. In this study, we analyzed Japanese
   commercial fishery catch data and scientific survey data of the diet of
   northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus, NFS) to investigate potential
   long-term ecosystem changes in the western North Pacific Ocean off
   northeastern Japan over the past 60 years. Total commercial catches
   experienced peaks around 1960 and during the 1980s, decreasing to low
   levels around 1970 and after 1990. Catches were substantively impacted
   by the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Species composition of the
   commercial catch changed over time, resulting in changes in the mean
   trophic level (MTL) of the catches. Trends in observed commercial
   catches were affected by many factors, including species population
   fluctuations potentially related to large-scale environmental shifts,
   migration and distribution patterns of species related to local
   oceanography, changes in fishing technology, and the introduction of
   fishery management frameworks. The composition of NFS diet also changed
   over time: although overall changes were small, MTL derived from NFS
   stomach contents declined from the early 1970s to the late 1980s. This
   fall in the MTL of the diet of NFS is suggestive of a shift in pelagic
   fish fauna from a ``mackerel-dominant regime{''} to a ``sardine-dominant
   regime{''}. Inconsistencies between changes in species composition and
   MTLs of the commercial catch and NFS diet resulted from differences in
   commercial fishing targeting and NFS foraging behavior strategies.
   Although commercial catch is a valuable source of information for
   investigating historical changes in fisheries, biological resources, and
   ecosystems, catch data should be interpreted carefully and other
   relevant information available should also be considered. (C) 2014

   ecological fingerprints of production systems?",AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT,2005,109,1-2,153-165,AUG 1,"Societal interest in food safety, animal welfare, and environmental
   quality attributes of food production is increasing, creating a need for
   reliable indicators of such factors. Here we test the hypothesis that
   cattle farming systems create unique and meaningful isotopic
   fingerprints, which can be characterized by analysing cattle tail switch
   hair. To this end we analysed feeding practices and nutrient fluxes, and
   sampled hair, feed components and fertilizers from 13 different farms in
   Upper Bavaria, Germany. The farms represented the range of cattle
   farming types present in the region and included: conventional
   confinement dairy, pasture based organic and conventional dairy, suckler
   cow, and bull and steer and heifer fattening enterprises. Samples were
   analysed for their carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotope
   composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15). Feed samples could be assigned
   to one of three groups with characteristic delta C-13, which varied very
   little between and within farms: C-3 forages (including fresh forage,
   hay or silage from grassland and clover-grass mixtures) with -28.4 parts
   per thousand (+/- 0.5 parts per thousand S.D.), maize (Zea mays L.) with
   -12.5 parts per thousand (+/- 0.4 parts per thousand), and C-3-derived
   concentrates (including mainly cereal grain and legume seeds) with -26.8
   (+/- 1.1 parts per thousand). The dry matter fraction of maize in the
   diet explained 96\% of the farm average delta C-13 of hair. Hair was
   approx. 2.7 parts per thousand enriched in C-13 relative to the diet
   (trophic level shift), and this effect was very similar for growing
   animals and cows, and seemingly independent of the fraction of maize in
   the diet. In contrast to delta C-13, the delta N-15 of individual feed
   types differed very strongly between - and also within - farms. Only
   legume seeds had relatively constant delta N-15 (1.2 +/- 0.5 parts per
   thousand). delta N-15 of cow hair was correlated with stocking rate
   (r(2) = 0.55) and N input surplus (farm gate) (r(2) = 0.78),
   respectively. This correlation was probably caused by increasing losses
   of N-15-depleted N via ammonia volatilisation, nitrate leaching and
   denitrification with increasing farm-level N surplus. Heterogeneity of
   feed N-15 signatures indicated within-farm heterogeneity of N fluxes and
   cycling that was at (least partially) integrated in cattle hair. Thus,
   cattle hair N-15 signature appears to indicate the `leakiness' of cattle
   production systems for N. Conversely, the C-13 signatures reliably
   indicates maize feeding and, thus, the type of land use (arable forage
   cropping versus grassland farming) on which cattle production in the
   region is based. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Auerswald, K (Corresponding Author), Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Grunlandlehre, Am Hochanger 1, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.

   heterogeneous savanna ecosystems in the Plio-Pleistocene Malawi Rift",PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY,2016,459,NA,170-181,OCT 1,"The Plio-Pleistocene expansion of Eastern Africa savanna ecosystems was
   a major driver for morphological and behavioral innovations in hominin
   evolution. Most evidence for hominin ecosystem reconstructions
   originates from the Eastern Rift in today's Somali-Masai Endemic Zone.
   We provide stable carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope
   data from 22 bovid, equid, suid, hippopotamid and elephant teeth from
   the southern part of the East African Rift and supplement these by 8180
   values of present-day meteoric water. This region (Karonga Basin,
   Malawi) hosts remains of Homo rudolfensis and Paranthropus boisei. It is
   situated between hominin-bearing sites in Eastern and Southern Africa
   and therefore fills an important geographical gap for hominin evolution.
   Tooth enamel delta C-18 and 8180 data of 14 large-bodied mammalian
   herbivore species from Units 2 and 3 (ca. 4.3 to 0.6 Ma) in the Chiwondo
   Beds provide information about foraging strategies and vegetation
   patterns. Our stable isotope data reflect C-3-dominated ecosystems that
   permitted access to open C-4-environments for migratory mammals. Many
   analyzed taxa show evidence for mixed diets with high abundances of
   C-3-biomass consumption; only selected bovids were specialized grazers.
   delta O-18 of present-day meteoric water reflects rainfall amount and
   seasonality, elevation, and lake evaporation. 6180 values of Karonga
   Basin herbivore enamel are generally low and cover values similar to
   present-day drinking water, indicating both, evaporated and freshwater
   sources. Comparison of delta C-13 values from the Karonga Basin with
   other Eastern African herbivore communities reveals significant
   differences in dietary patterns with much more generalized mixed
   C-3/C-4, and pure C-3 feeding behaviors in the Malawi Rift. Similarly,
   enamel 6180 values are lower than in most Plio-Pleistocene Eastern
   African herbivores, suggesting more humid conditions. Collectively, our
   data support models in which early hominin foraging activity included
   access to C-3-dominated biomes, complicating traditional interpretations
   linking early human evolutionary innovations to a shift towards savanna
   habitats. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Lüdecke, T (Corresponding Author), Senckenberg Biodivers \& Climate Res Ctr, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.

   intensively studied due to technical limitations. Studying this vast
   part of the coral reef is paramount to understanding the ecological and
   physiological significance of coral-algae symbiosis and defining the
   boundaries imposed on its bathymetric distribution by the underwater
   light field. In the present study we describe morphological changes in
   colonies of the coral Stylophora pistillata and track changes in its
   carbon sources (autotrophic/heterotrophic behavior) along its full
   bathymetric distribution. The growth form of hermatypic corals must
   compromise between an optimal light-trapping surface facilitating
   photosynthesis and other structures and/or mechanisms that enhance
   exploitation of nutrient-rich sources such as zooplankton. That
   architectural modulation is constrained within the species-specific
   structural and biological characteristics. We found that the profusely
   branched S. pistillata colonies shift between subspherical morphology at
   high-light environments to a planar structure at depth. The stable
   carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) of the host coral tissue
   changed from a value of -15 parts per thousand in shallow water to -23
   parts per thousand, at the deep reef. The latter value indicates either
   a carbon source with a stable isotope composition equal or below -23
   parts per thousand or, alternatively, internal carbon cycling between
   host and algae that involves isotopic fractionation (epsilon). The delta
   C-13 values showed significant correlation to morphological traits, but
   contradicting trends were found within the traits. A clear shift to
   heterotrophy was not apparent, which, therefore, suggests that the
   internal cycling and Rubisco activity are the dominant processes

   controlled contexts, the Early Formative period site of La Consentida
   was occupied between 1950 and 1550 cal BCE. In addition to evidence of
   early pottery and mounded earthen architecture, this site has produced
   fourteen sets of human remains in twelve discrete burials. The people of
   La Consentida lived and died during a period of key socioeconomic
   transitions including the establishment of sedentary villages, a shift
   toward agriculture, and the origins of formalized social inequality. In
   this paper, we discuss the archaeological context of La Consentida's
   burials and the results of bioarchaeological and stable isotopic
   analyses of human and faunal remains from the site. Stable isotope
   values and paleopathological data suggest significant maize consumption
   concurrent with increasing dental attrition. Considered alongside
   changes in food processing tools, this pattern suggests a culinary
   transition regarding maize use. Burial goods and associated features
   (including a ceremonial cache containing faunal remains, ceramics, and a
   musical instrument) shed light on mortuary practices. As some of
   Oaxaca's earliest known human remains the burials of La Consentida offer
   a rare opportunity for multidisciplinary investigation of the diet,
   lifestyles, and mortuary traditions of an early Mesoamerican village.

   the Wadden Sea - A Fatty Acid Biomarker Approach",FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,2020,7,NA,NA,SEP 29,"Tidal coasts are characterized by natural disturbances, forming a broad
   variety of habitats, which provide different niches and varying food
   resources for benthic foraminifera. Foraminifera occupy different
   trophic levels and fill key trophic positions in benthic food webs, but
   detailed studies on their nutrition spectrum in inter- to supratidal
   environments are lacking. Further, it is unknown to what extent
   foraminifera can switch between different feeding modes depending on
   resource availability in different Wadden Sea habitats. In order to shed
   light on these questions, we investigated potential food resources in
   sediments as well as the food spectrum of two dominant benthic
   foraminifera, Trochammina inflate and Ammonia tepida, in four
   characteristic habitats of the Wadden Sea: salt marsh, mixed flat,
   oyster reef and mud flat, using fatty acid (FA) analysis. The sediments
   of the four habitats provide a broad range of food sources including
   green algae, brown algae, diatoms and bacteria for benthic foraminifera.
   The FA profile of T inflate from the salt marsh and mixed flat was
   dominated by green algae and bacteria, whereas the brown algae biomarker
   was only found in specimens from the salt marsh. In comparison, FA
   profiles of A. tepida suggested dominant algae feeding (green algae and
   diatoms), whereas brown algae and bacterial FAs were only found in
   specimens from the oyster reef. The results suggest that foraminifera
   mainly feed at low trophic levels with selective food intake closely
   depending on their habitat. The diverse nutritional strategies may allow
   efficient exploitation of resources in dynamic tidal habitats.
   Presumably, foraminifera serve as an important link between lower and
   higher trophic levels and thus fill key trophic positions in the benthic
   food web of the Wadden Sea.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Haynert, K (Corresponding Author), Senckenberg Meer, Marine Res Dept, Wilhelmshaven, Germany.

   the Early Pleistocene: Implications for adaptation and extinction",QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS,2020,228,NA,NA,JAN 15,"Since its sub-aerial emergence, Java has experienced multiple tectonic,
   geographic and climatic changes, which affected the megafaunal
   occupation, adaptation and succession. Six Proboscidean taxa have been
   found from various localities throughout Java extending back to the
   Early to Late Pleistocene. The six taxa are: Stegoloxodon indonesicus,
   Sinomastodon bumiajuensis, pygmy Stegodon sp., Stegodon trigonocephalus,
   Elephas hysudrindicus and Elephas maximus, in which respective taxa are
   included in successive faunal stages. The aim of this research was to
   reconstruct the succession of Proboscidea in Java and the adaptation of
   each taxon to environmental changes by incorporating stable isotope
   analysis with the fossil faunal record, geology and stratigraphy. We
   conducted stable carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope
   analysis of the carbonate phase in the tooth enamel of six proboscidean
   taxa from numerous localities and ages. Our results suggest that for the
   earliest terrestrial fauna from Java, represented by Stegoloxodon
   indonesicus, the feeding ecology was restricted to a closed canopy
   rainforest during the earliest Pleistocene, while towards the late Early
   Pleistocene, the successive taxon, Sinomastodon bumiajuensis, was
   adapted to different or increasingly drier grassy habitats. C-4
   expansion on the island took place since the later part of the Early
   Pleistocene (before 1.5 Ma) and continued until the Middle Pleistocene,
   as suggested by the carbon and oxygen isotope composition of assemblages
   of proboscidean taxa from Sangiran, Kedung Brubus, Trinil, and western
   Java, which also predominantly display the expected range of
   C-4-dominant feeders. However, the occurrence of mixed C-3/C-4 feeder
   Proboscidea in the Ngandong Fauna suggests that fragmented dense
   evergreen forests, shrubby or woodland vegetation reappeared towards the
   end of the Middle Pleistocene. This environmental shift is detected in
   the later stage of the Middle Pleistocene, as the dietary preference of
   all analysed samples from individuals from this age shifted back from a
   C-4-dominated into a C-3-dominated diet, which suggests a change from a
   dry to more humid climate conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Article,Shuran Cindy Wang and Xueqin Liu and Yong Liu and Hongzhu Wang,Benthic-pelagic coupling in lake energetic food webs,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,2020,417,NA,NA,FEB 1,"Understanding how energy and matter flow among habitats is a central
   issue in ecology. In lake ecosystems, benthic-pelagic coupling (B-P
   coupling) was mainly studied based on the diets of top consumers at a
   population level or through food chains. However, how B-P coupling
   operates at the ecosystem level is largely unknown.
   In the present study, we revealed B-P coupling within an energetic food
   web framework, combining stable isotope analyses and mass balanced
   model. We constructed the energetic food webs of two large shallow lakes
   of different trophic status based on field survey data. We also defined
   benthic and pelagic components based on the proportion of consumer
   energy uptake from phytoplankton (benthic: < 50\%; pelagic: > 50\%;
   benthivore: < 20\%; planktivore: > 80\%; coupler: 20-80\%) and
   quantified the energy flux through B-P coupling in the two lake food
   webs.
   The total consumption was estimated to be 699 t/km(2)/y in Lake Erhai
   (mesoeutrophic lake) and 2094 t/km(2)/y in Lake Dianchi (hypereutrophic
   lake), and the B-P coupling energy was 405 t/km(2)/y and 213 t/km(2)/y,
   re-spectively. In these lakes, B-P coupling occurred on multiple trophic
   levels; lower trophic level consumers contributed the largest proportion
   (90\% and 98\%), while top consumers were of limited importance; most
   coupling links were weak, and energy exchange was highly asymmetric with
   the total amount of energy exported from benthic part to pelagic part
   being over 4 folds of the counter flux.
   The quantity and pattern of B-P coupling vary between the mesoeutrophic
   and hypereutrophic lakes. In terms of energy flux per unit area, the
   total system throughput in the mesoeutrophic lake (Lake Erhai) was 3.73
   times of that in the hypereutrophic lake (Lake Dianchi), while the
   proportion of coupling energy was much lower in the former (19\%) than
   the latter (31\%). A greater energy flux through pelagic-to-benthic
   pathways was found in the hypereutrophic lake, and most of the coupling
   energy was contributed by consumers at higher trophic levels. Besides,
   the coupling strength was stronger in the hypereutrophic than the
   mesoeutrophic lake.
   We showed for the first time how B-P coupling operates in lake energetic
   food webs. Our results provided new insights into understanding the
   energy flux through B-P coupling of lake ecosystems, and how such
   coupling could be changed by environmental disturbances. We also
   provided a new approach to reveal habitat coupling within an energetic
   food web framework.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Liu, XQ (Corresponding Author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol \& Biotechnol, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.

   putative detrimental effects of exposure to ionizing radiation, with
   biomarkers such as an increase in DNA damage and/or oxidative stress
   commonly associated with radiation exposure. To examine the effects of
   exposure to radiation on gene expression in wildlife, we conducted a de
   novo RNA sequencing study of liver and spleen tissues from a rodent, the
   bank vole Myodes glareolus. Bank voles were collected from the Chernobyl
   Exclusion Zone (CEZ), where animals were exposed to elevated levels of
   radionuclides, and from uncontaminated areas near Kyiv, Ukraine. Counter
   to expectations, we did not observe a strong DNA damage response in
   animals exposed to radionuclides, although some signs of oxidative
   stress were identified. Rather, exposure to environmental radionuclides
   was associated with upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism
   and fatty acid oxidation in the livers - an apparent shift in energy
   metabolism. Moreover, using stable isotope analysis, we identified that
   fur from bank voles inhabiting the CEZ had enriched isotope values of
   nitrogen: such an increase is consistent with increased fatty acid
   metabolism, but also could arise from a difference in diet or habitat
   between the CEZ and elsewhere. In livers and spleens, voles inhabiting
   the CEZ were characterized by immunosuppression, such as impaired
   antigen processing, and activation of leucocytes involved in
   inflammatory responses. In conclusion, exposure to low dose

   Pleistocene human populations from Europe and the Near East",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,2003,44,4,497-513,APR,"Non-occlusal, buccal tooth microwear variability has been studied in 68
   fossil humans from Europe and the Near East. The microwear patterns
   observed suggest that a major shift in human dietary habits and food
   processing techniques might have taken place in the transition from the
   Middle to the Late Pleistocene populations. Differences in microwear
   density, average length, and orientation of striations indicate that
   Middle Pleistocene humans had more abrasive dietary habits than Late
   Pleistocene populations. Both dietary and cultural factors might be
   responsible for the differences observed. In addition, the Middle
   Paleolithic Neandertal specimens studied show a highly heterogeneous
   pattern of microwear when compared to the other samples considered,
   which is inconsistent with a hypothesis of all Neandertals having a
   strictly carnivorous diet. The high density of striations observed in
   the buccal surfaces of several Neandertal teeth might be indicative of
   the inclusion of plant foods in their diet. The buccal microwear
   variability observed in the Neandertals is compatible with an overall
   exploitation of both plant and meat foods on the basis of food
   availability. A preliminary analysis of the relationship between buccal
   microwear density and climatic conditions prevailing in Europe during
   the Late Pleistocene has been attempted. Cold climatic conditions, as
   indicated by oxygen isotope stage data, seem to be responsible for
   higher densities of microwear features, whereas warmer periods could
   correspond to a reduced pattern of scratch density. Such a relationship
   would be indicative of less abrasive dietary habits, perhaps more meat
   dependent, during warmer periods. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   trophic position, ontogeny and trophic diversity provides information on
   community-level structure and function. Little attention has been
   focused on examining the trophic structure and temporal changes of
   communities in freshwater-marine coupled systems in the subarctic and
   associated impacts of anthropogenic activity on trophic interactions.
   Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the trophic
   position of mobile consumers (15 species in total) within the lower
   Churchill River area (Churchill, Manitoba, Canada), examine trophic
   position variation in relation to ontogeny, and measure the trophic
   diversity of a fish assemblage before (1993-1995) and after (2019-2020)
   the installation of the Churchill River weir in the late 1990s. We used
   stable isotopes (delta 13C and delta 15N) to quantify individual and
   group-level variation in trophic position of thirteen fish species and
   two seal species and also assessed six community-level metrics of a
   three fish species assemblage between time periods. Overall, species
   that mainly foraged on freshwater resources occupied lower trophic
   positions than species that mainly consumed marine resources. Trophic
   position increased with fish age only in cisco, fourhorn sculpin,
   Greenland cod and northern pike. A temporal shift from a trophically
   diverse to a more trophically redundant fish assemblage occurred between
   1993-1995 and 2019-2020. As a result, these predator species now play
   similar trophic roles. Information on the long-term change in trophic
   structure of this sub-Arctic estuarine system may help with
   understanding how anthropogenic activity and climate change have
   influenced the trophic diversity of a fish assemblage inhabiting this

   Subtropical Shallow Eutrophic Lake: Evidence Based on Long-Term
   Monitoring and Modeling",ECOSYSTEMS,2020,23,7,1449-1463,NOV,"Lake ecosystems are exposed to a range of anthropogenic pressures,
   particularly eutrophication, and in some cases also stocking and/or
   overfishing of top-predator fish species, all factors that have
   implications for the food web structure and which could lead to
   dominance of nuisance cyanobacteria. Restoration of degraded lakes
   demands insight into the relative role of top-down for bottom-up
   regulating forces. While knowledge about these forces in temperate lakes
   is extensive, comparatively little is known of their role in subtropical
   lakes where the importance of herbivorous and benthic feeding fish is
   higher. Here, we analyzed a long-term monitoring data set on
   subtropical, shallow Lake Taihu, China, and applied random forests
   regression to examine how phytoplankton was related to environmental
   variables and biotic assemblages. Our results indicate that the biomass
   and density of phytoplankton increased with increasing biomass of
   benthivorous and zooplanktivorous fish and decreased with increases in
   ammonium concentrations, the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio, and
   zooplankton biomass, while the response to climate fluctuations and
   changes in the biomass of piscivores was weak. Effects of higher trophic
   levels explained as much of the variance in phytoplankton biomass as did
   nutrients and climatic factors. Moreover, the remarkably reduced ratio
   of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass and the decline in cladoceran
   individual biomass emphasized the increasing importance of top-down
   control in regulating the phytoplankton following extensive stocking.

   Hydropsychidae) in Lake Superior, the Last Stronghold of a Once-Dominant
   Great Lakes Surf Zone Caddisfly",INSECTS,2022,13,7,NA,JUL,"Simple Summary Prior to the invasion and spread of Dreissena mussels in
   the late 1980s, the nearshore waters of the Laurentian Great Lakes were
   home to diverse assemblages of native aquatic insects, including the
   net-spinning caddisfly Hydropsyche alternans, which occurred in rocky
   surf-exposed habitat throughout the system from Lake Superior downstream
   to Lake Ontario. These surf zone caddisflies are still abundant in the
   largely Dreissena-free waters of Lake Superior where the present study
   was conducted. They have not been reported in the lakes below Lake
   Superior for decades, and are presumed to have been extirpated from
   Dreissena-infested habitats. The ecological profile presented here
   documents the life history of H. alternans in Lake Superior, and reveals
   details of its feeding biology that shed light on the roles that surf
   zone net-spinners play in the native nearshore food webs of the Great
   Lakes. The H. alternans life history in Lake Superior begins in
   mid-summer shortly after oviposition, which features females swimming to
   surf-exposed lake bottom substrates. Larval development takes
   approximately 10 months, but most of it occurs during their first 100
   days. Adult emergence is broadly synchronous, with large numbers present
   from the summer solstice through mid-July. Gut content analyses showed
   that larvae opportunistically feed on algal, animal, and detrital
   material of aquatic and terrestrial origin. delta C-13 and delta N-15
   stable isotope data indicate that they function as omnivores that link
   coastal, nearshore, and pelagic food webs. These energetic links, and
   the very existence of surf zone insect assemblages in the Great Lakes,
   depend on the Dreissena populations in Lake Superior remaining
   relatively small and isolated. We studied the life history, diet, and
   trophic ecology of Hydropsyche alternans in four rocky sites located
   along the south-central coast of Lake Superior. The H. alternans life
   history and broad trophic niche space were similar to those of its
   riverine relatives. Quantitative sampling over the course of one
   ice-free season revealed that most individuals lived univoltine life
   histories that featured early to mid-summer mating, and oviposition and
   rapid growth and development through summer into fall. Most individuals
   overwintered as ultimate or penultimate larval instars. Pupation
   followed ice-out in the spring. Gut content sampling and delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 stable isotope analyses indicated that the typical larval
   diet is a mix of benthic, pelagic, and terrestrial food resources,
   including diatoms, small arthropods, sloughed periphyton, and in one
   site, fugal hyphae apparently of foredune origin. As a
   suspension-feeding omnivore that relies on waves and currents to deliver
   food to its nets, H. alternans larvae form energetic links between
   coastal, nearshore, and offshore food webs. These connections have been
   lost throughout the lower Laurentian Great Lakes as a consequence of the
   invasion and spread of Dreissena mussels.",MDPI,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Strand, M (Corresponding Author), Northern Michigan Univ, Dept Biol, Marquette, MI 49855 USA.

   gain insight into trophic dynamics, especially of mobile aquatic
   predators whose behavior and dietary preferences are difficult to
   directly measure. Olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) range
   across >3 million km(2) of the tropical and subtropical eastern Pacific
   Ocean and their trophic ecology in open ocean areas has not yet been
   adequately described. Individuals feed within biogeographic regions
   where varying nutrient cycling regimes result in phytoplankton with
   distinct delta C-13 and delta N-15 values that are assimilated by the
   turtles. We sampled 346 turtles at-sea between 2003 and 2009 and used
   bulk tissue (n = 346) and amino acid compound specific isotope analysis
   (AA-CSIA, n = 31) to empirically support the conventional understanding
   that olive ridleys are omnivores. Bulk delta N-15 values did not
   significantly vary with carapace length, a proxy for age, or with
   putative sex of adults. We therefore hypothesize that trophic position
   (TP) does not vary across age or sex. In line with other isotopic
   studies of this biogeographic scale in the same region, we observed a
   trend of bulk tissue N-15 enrichment with increasing latitude. Using
   AA-CSIA to account for delta N-15 baseline shifts among food webs
   (space), we estimated the TP of adult foragers using two methods. We
   found that across their eastern Pacific range, olive ridley delta C-13
   and delta N-15 niche area varied, but median TP of adults remained
   constant (similar to 3.1). Using a two-amino acid TP estimation method,
   we detected a small but notable elevation of TP for olive ridleys on the
   Costa Rica Dome. This study underscores the value of large-scale
   in-water olive ridley sea turtle research across oceanic foraging
   habitats to confirm or challenge anecdotal understanding of trophic
   roles, susceptibility to environmental change, and critical habitats.
   Further, it improves our understanding of why this species is now
   abundant in the eastern Pacific Ocean. A prey generalist with plenty of
   suitable foraging habitat can recover from the brink of extinction
   despite the presence of major threats. However, such foraging
   characteristics may require dynamic open ocean management approaches to
   meet conservation objectives if threats persist and/or increase.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Peavey, LE (Corresponding Author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.

   cool and dry environments of the East European Plain - offer a unique
   setting for comparison of Neanderthal and modern human diet. There are
   some taphonomic factors specific to this setting, however, including
   those related to the scarcity of natural shelters and distribution of
   woody plants on the central plain, which complicate the analysis of Late
   Pleistocene human diet. Neanderthals occupied southern upland areas, and
   sometimes the southwest and central plain, probably sustaining
   themselves primarily on the hunting of large mammals, which often
   included steppe species such as Bison priscus and Saiga tatarica. It is
   difficult to understand how recent hunter-gatherers in some of these
   environments (e.g., southwest plain during the Middle Pleniglacial)
   could have sustained themselves throughout the year on the basis of
   large mammal hunting without food storage. The key to Neanderthal
   survival in such habitats may have been the hunting of mammoth and
   rhinoceros - very large herbivores not available to recent
   hunter-gatherers in northern interior settings. Modern humans - who are
   present on the East European Plain as early as anywhere in Europe
   broadened the diet to include small mammals, birds, and/or fish during
   the Middle Pleniglacial. Evidence of this shift, which seems to have
   been achieved through the design of novel food-getting technologies, is
   derived both from the faunal remains and stable isotope analysis of
   human bone. Modern humans occupied the loess-steppe habitat on the
   central plain during the Late Pleniglacial and often used their food
   debris as fuel.",SPRINGER,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Proceedings Paper,English,"Hoffecker, JF (Corresponding Author), Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic \& Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.

   extinction threats, which has prompted conservationists to implement
   captive breeding programmes that aid the recovery of imperilled species.
   Understanding factors that limit the survival of hatchery-spawned fishes
   after stocking is critical to future conservation efforts using captive
   populations. As the size at which juvenile piscivorous fishes shift to
   consuming other fish can influence their survival, the transition to
   piscivory by hatchery-spawned Ptychocheilus lucius Girard, 1856
   (Colorado pikeminnow) was investigated after stocking the San Juan River
   in New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah, USA. The stable isotope N-15 was used
   to track ontogenetic changes in the trophic position of individuals
   stocked at age 0, with the expectation that they would become fully
   piscivorous by age 2. By sampling the isotopic signatures of Colorado
   pikeminnow across multiple years, the ability of river discharge and
   densities of fish prey to explain interannual variation in trophic
   position was also explored. Annual variation in river flow and the
   densities of fish prey had little predictive power in explaining
   variation in delta N-15 of age-1 or age-2 Colorado pikeminnow. After
   assessing the isotopic signatures of potential prey, a Bayesian isotopic
   mixing model suggested that invertebrates comprised nearly 25\% of the
   diet of of both age-1 and age-2 individuals. The relationship between
   Colorado pikeminnow size and delta N-15 within stocked cohorts indicated
   that juveniles slowly transitioned to consuming fish prey as they grew,
   rather than abruptly switching, as indicated from a limited number of
   dietary studies using wild fish. Together, these results suggest that
   Colorado pikeminnow stocked into the San Juan River slowly transition to
   consuming fish prey. If this pattern leads to poor survival and
   recruitment, the effectiveness of this management action for
   conservation could be compromised.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Franssen, NR (Corresponding Author), US Fish \& Wildlife Serv, New Mexico Ecol Serv Field Off, 2105 Osuna Rd NE, Albuquerque, NM 87113 USA.

   and to test hypotheses regarding the development of C-4 ecosystems and
   the dynamics of the Asian monsoons, the carbon and oxygen isotopic
   compositions of 32 bulk and 368 serial tooth enamel samples from
   herbivores in the Linxia Basin (Gansu Province), ranging in age from 25
   Ma to the present, were determined. The results corroborate and improve
   the record previously obtained from the area, showing that all mammals
   in the Linxia Basin lived in habitats consisting primarily of C-3
   vegetation prior to 2-3 Ma and that C-4 grasses did not become a
   significant component of local ecosystems until the Quaternary. The data
   also show that shifts in climate to drier and/or warmer conditions after
   about 14, 9.5, 7, and 2.5 Ma, as indicated by positive delta O-18
   excursions in the bulk enamel-delta O-18 record, were accompanied by
   increased seasonality; whereas negative delta O-18 shifts in the bulk
   data after about 11, 6, and 1.2 Ma, which indicate shifts to wetter
   and/or cooler climate, were associated with decreases in seasonality.
   Intra-tooth delta C-13 and delta O-18 profiles reveal significant
   changes in the seasonal patterns of diet and climate after similar to
   2-3 Ma. Prior to similar to 2-3 Ma, there was little or no seasonal
   variation in herbivores diets and all herbivores fed on C-3 vegetation
   year around. After that time, the data show a significant seasonal
   variation in the diets of horses and bovids, ranging from a pure C-3 to
   a mixed C-3/C-4 diet (with C-4 plants accounting for up to similar to
   60\% of the diet). An inverse relationship (or negative correlation)
   between delta C-13 and delta O-18 values within individual teeth - a
   pattern characteristic of the summer monsoon regime - is observed in
   younger (<2-3 Ma) horses and bovids but not in older fossils. These
   changes in intra-tooth isotopic patterns provide strong evidence for an
   enhanced monsoon climate since about 2-3 Ma. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

   COASTAL ECOSYSTEM",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,2008,18,8,1874-1887,DEC,"Mounting evidence suggests that fishing can trigger trophic cascades and
   alter food web dynamics, yet its effects on ecosystem function remain
   largely unknown. We used the large-scale experimental framework of four
   marine reserves, spanning an oceanographic gradient in northeastern New
   Zealand, to test the extent to which the exploitation of reef predators
   can alter kelp carbon flux and secondary production. We provide evidence
   that the reduction of predatory snapper (Pagrus auratus) and lobster
   (Jasus edwardsii) can lead to an increase in sea urchins (Evechinus
   chloroticus) and indirect declines in kelp biomass in some locations but
   not others. Stable carbon isotope ratios (delta(13)C) of oysters
   (Crassostrea gigas) and mussels (Perna canaliculus) transplanted in
   reserve and. shed sites within four locations revealed that fishing
   indirectly reduced the proportion of kelp-derived organic carbon
   assimilated by filter feeders in two locations where densities of
   actively grazing sea urchins were 23.7 and 8.3 times higher and kelp
   biomass was an order of magnitude lower than in non. shed reserve sites.
   In contrast, in the two locations where fishing had no effect on urchin
   density or kelp biomass, we detected no effect of fishing on the carbon
   signature of filter feeders. We show that the effects of fishing on
   nearshore trophic structure and carbon flux are context-dependent and
   hinge on large-scale, regional oceanographic factors. Where cascading
   effects of fishing on kelp biomass were documented, enhanced
   assimilation of kelp carbon did not result in the magnification of
   secondary production. Instead, a strong regional gradient in filter
   feeder growth emerged, best predicted by chlorophyll a. Estimates of
   kelp contribution to the diet of transplanted consumers averaged 56.9\%
   +/- 6.2\% (mean +/- SE) for mussels and 33.8\% +/- 7.3\% for oysters,
   suggesting that organic carbon flxed by kelp is an important food source
   fueling northeastern New Zealand's nearshore food webs. The importance
   of predators in mediating benthic primary production and organic carbon
   flux suggests that over fishing can have profound consequences on
   ecosystem functioning particularly where pelagic primary production is
   limiting. Our results underscore the broader ecosystem repercussions of
   overfishing and its context-dependent effects.",ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Article,English,"Salomon, AK (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.

   Resources Supporting Tropical River Fish Assemblages in Chiapas, Mexico",TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,2020,149,6,753-769,NOV,"Environmental changes caused by hydrological shifts between wet and dry
   seasons in the tropics drive variation in resource availability and
   feeding interactions for riverine fish assemblages, but studies of
   trophic structure typically take place over short time scales that do
   not adequately capture this variation. In this study, we used analysis
   of stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) to assess seasonal
   changes in the diversity and relative importance of production sources
   supporting fish assemblages in La Venta River, the largest tributary of
   Netzahualcoyotl Reservoir on the Grijalva River in Chiapas, Mexico.
   Based on established river ecosystem theories, we expected the relative
   importance of carbon sources supporting fishes to shift seasonally, with
   greater use of instream resources during low-water periods and an
   increasing contribution from terrestrial sources during high-water
   periods. Abundant, low-trophic-level food resources (i.e., plants and
   invertebrates) were expected to support most fish species in the wet
   season, whereas piscivory was predicted to increase as habitat volume
   declined and fish density increased in the dry season. Somewhat
   surprisingly, we found that terrestrial energy sources were assimilated
   more during low-water conditions at some sites, and ranges of delta C-13
   were higher in the dry season. Terrestrial carbon supporting fish
   production in low-water periods likely came from riparian plant detritus
   that remained in the river after flows receded and/or leaf litter that
   accumulated in the dry season. Ranges of delta N-15 were similar across
   seasons, with no apparent increase in piscivory during the dry season.
   Higher trophic redundancy was observed in the wet season, likely due to
   fish taking advantage of the same readily available food items (e.g.,
   pulses of arthropod prey) during high flows. Documenting seasonal use of
   trophic resources provides critical information as expanding
   hydroelectric dam construction threatens the natural variability of
   energy pathways that support fisheries resources in tropical rivers.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Rodiles-Hernández, R (Corresponding Author), Dept Conservac Biodiversidad, San Cristobal Las Casas 29290, Chiapas, Mexico.

   fish and invertebrate species in the Bohai Strait over a single year
   based on carbon, and nitrogen isotope analysis",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,2016,70,SI,348-356,NOV,"Fishing is the most widespread human exploitation of marine resources,
   which has an annual cyclical influence on aquatic species in Chinese
   offshore waters. This study used carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios as
   tracers to reveal the changes in trophic level and dietary composition
   of offshore organisms during four cruises in March, June, August and
   November 2014. The results indicated that the trophic levels of fishes
   declined during two fishing periods, from March (average trophic level =
   3.36) to June (3.01), and from August (2.99) to November (2.57), while
   most invertebrates did not show this trend. The self-restoring ability
   of this ecosystem was reflected in the trophic level changes after the
   closed fishing season (from June 1 to September 1). The trophic levels
   of fishes remained stable, and some species even recovered such as
   Enchelyopus elongates (trophic level increased from 2.84 in June to 2.86
   in August), Cryptocentrus filifer (from 3.10 to 3.12), and Ernogrammus
   hexagrammus (from 2.91 to 2.96). According to the trophic results, we
   selected the invertebrates Octopus minor and Asterias arnurensis from
   the top trophic levels for dietary composition analysis. The composition
   of their diets changed significantly after fishing periods, and the
   proportions of some smaller and ``non-commercial{''} species increased,
   such as No toacmea schrenckii and Chlorostoma rustica. After the closed
   fishing season, the larger and ``commercial{''} species contributed a
   greater proportion to their diet composition. These results indicated
   that the closed fishing season should be prolonged to give the ecosystem
   enough time to restore itself and further halt the trend of this fishery

   evaluating individual strategies with stable isotopes",FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY,2016,13,NA,NA,JUN 9,"Background: Species-specific strategies for financing the costs of
   reproduction are well understood, forming a continuum ranging from high
   to low reliance on stored nutrients. Animals relying mostly on stored
   reserves are termed `capital breeders', whereas `income breeders' rely
   mostly on concurrent intake when financing the costs of reproduction.
   The role and adaptive value of individual variation in these strategies
   remain elusive. Life-history theory posits that capital breeding should
   be favoured when offspring reproductive value peaks, typically occurring
   early in the season, and that current income should increasingly be used
   with progressing season. Because resource limitation may hamper flexible
   resource allocation, a corollary prediction is that only good-condition
   individuals may show the expected seasonal shift in resource use. To
   test this prediction, we examined stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta
   N-15) in blood and lipid-free egg yolk of breeding eider females
   (Somateria mollissima) from the Baltic Sea to assess the role of
   individual variation in the use of proteins from local diet vs. stored
   reserves.
   Results: We show for the first time that individuals from a single
   population differ in their utilization of stored reserves and concurrent
   intake to finance the costs of reproduction. Consistent with our
   prediction, heavy females predominantly used stored reserves for
   producing egg yolks early in the season, increasingly relying on local
   feeding with later onset of breeding, whereas light females showed no
   seasonal change in allocation strategy.
   Conclusions: Stable isotope profiling at the individual level is a
   powerful tool for monitoring relative changes in investment strategies
   through time, showing promise as an early warning indicator of
   ecological change in food webs.",BMC,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Jaatinen, K (Corresponding Author), Novia Univ Appl Sci, Coastal Zone Res Team, Raseborgsvagen 9, FI-10600 Ekenas, Finland.

   from acidification and metal contamination",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2010,55,8,1616-1627,AUG,"P>1. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) are often the only surviving fish
   species in acidified lakes. We studied four lakes along a gradient of
   recovery from acidification and that had different food web
   complexities. All had abundant yellow perch, two had low piscivore
   abundance, one had a well-established piscivore population and one was
   manipulated by introducing piscivorous smallmouth bass (Micropterus
   dolomieu). We hypothesised that there would be strong effects on perch
   abundance, behaviour and diet induced by the presence of piscivores.
   2. In the manipulated lake, the bass reduced yellow perch abundance by
   75\% over a 2-year period. Concomitantly, perch use of the pelagic
   habitat fell from 48 to 40\%.
   3. In contrast to findings from less disturbed systems, yellow perch in
   the littoral zone of the manipulated lake did not strongly shift from
   zooplankton to benthic food sources after the arrival of piscivores.
   Diet analysis using stable carbon isotopes revealed a strong continued
   reliance on zooplankton in all lakes, independent of the degree of
   piscivory. The failure to switch to benthos in the refuge area of the
   littoral zone is most likely related to the depauperate benthos
   communities in these formerly acidified lakes.
   4. Yellow perch in lakes recovering from acidification face a
   considerable ecological challenge as the necessary switch to benthic
   diet is hindered by a low abundance of benthos. The arrival of
   piscivores in these recovering lakes imposes further restrictions on
   perch access to food items. We infer that future recovery of perch
   populations (and higher trophic levels) will have to be preceded by the
   re-establishment of diverse benthic macroinvertebrate communities in

   California: Possible limitations in assessing prey utilization and
   population dynamics",ISOTOPES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH STUDIES,2003,39,2,159-167,JUN,"White-tailed kite (Elanus leucurus) populations in the 1930s were close
   to extirpation in the United States. But by the 1940s, an upward trend
   towards recovery was apparent and continued to their current stable
   population levels. These dramatic fluctuations in,kite numbers may have
   been related to changes in rodent prey populations due to the conversion
   of native habitats to agriculture. To address this question, we
   evaluated the use of stable isotope analysis in determining if a shift
   in diet could be isotopically differentiated in current and historic
   kite populations. We first compared delta(13)C, delta(15)N, and
   delta(34)S values from present-day kite flight feathers and prey fur
   samples from four locations in California. The total ranges of isotope
   values for kite and their rodent prey were similar within each site.
   Carbon isotope values ranged from -27.1 to -22.2parts per thousand in
   Arcata, -26.1 to -16.9parts per thousand in Davis, -27.0 to -15.0parts
   per thousand in Cosumnes, and -28.2 to -11.6parts per thousand in Santa
   Barbara. Nitrogen isotope values ranged from 3.2 to 15.7parts per
   thousand in Arcata, 2.8 to 12.7parts per thousand in Davis, 4.0 to
   15.7parts per thousand in Cosumnes, and 1.7 to 20.0parts per thousand.
   in Santa Barbara. Sulfur isotope values ranged from -7.8 to 12.4parts
   per thousand in Arcata, -1.1 to 9.2parts per thousand in Davis, 0.7 to
   10.9parts per thousand in Cosumnes, and -8.6 to 15.6parts per thousand
   in Santa Barbara. Carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur isotope values at each
   site reflect typical trophic enrichments due to physiological processes.
   At each Site, delta(13)C and delta(15)N values reflected the influence
   of a predominantly C-3 or a mixed C-3/C-4 Plant community. Sulfur
   isotope values reflect the influence of predominant marine or
   terrestrial sulfur sources at each site. However, variability in isotope

   since the collapse of submerged macrophytes in Lake Ellesmere, New
   Zealand",HYDROBIOLOGIA,2007,579,NA,161-173,MAR,"Lake Ellesmere (Te Waihora) is a nationally important coastal brackish
   lake in New Zealand, however degradation in water quality and loss of
   submerged macrophytes over past decades have raised concerns in regards
   to the declining status of the lake's commercial and customary
   fisheries, predominantly targeted at shortfin eels (Anguilla australis).
   We investigated foodweb dynamics and trophic linkages to shortfin eels
   in Lake Ellesmere using a combination of abundance assessments, dietary
   studies, and stable isotope analyses. Data from our study are compared
   with historical data sets on benthic invertebrate community composition
   and shortfin eel diets to trace changes in the trophic linkages to top
   predators that have occurred since the late 1960s. Stable isotope
   analyses indicate that the foodweb is predominantly driven by epipelic
   and phytoplankton derived carbon sources, although it was difficult to
   discriminate between these two carbon pools because of wind-driven
   resuspension of lake sediments. Comparison of our survey results with
   historical data sets indicates a clear shift in benthic biota from being
   dominated by phytofaunal species such as Potamopyrgus antipodarum
   (comprising 90\% of total invertebrate biomass) during the 1960s, to now
   being almost entirely comprised of subterranean species such as
   Chironomus zealandicus and oligochaetes (together comprising 82\% of
   total invertebrate biomass). This shift in benthic communities has
   resulted in significant changes in the size-specific diet of juvenile
   shortfin eels (< 400 mm) from those reported for Lake Ellesmere during
   the mid 1970s, with Chironomus larvae now comprising 65\% of the diets
   of juvenile eels, whereas historically P. antipodarum was the dominant
   food item (> 30\% of total biomass). This shift towards foraging on
   smaller sediment-dwelling species could have implications for juvenile
   eel bioenergetics, and may help explain why juvenile shortfin growth
   rates have significantly decreased in past decades. Juvenile shortfins
   now appear to switch to foraging on preyfish (mainly common bullies,
   Gobiomorphus cotidianus) at a smaller size (< 400 mm) than historically
   recorded (> 500 mm). Dietary and stable isotope signatures indicated
   that small shortfins (100-299 mm) have considerable overlap in trophic
   position (delta C-13 = -20.4 degrees, delta 15 N = 13.6 degrees C) with
   common bullies (delta C-13 = -20.5 degrees C, delta N-15 = 13.7 degrees
   C), the dominant fish in Lake Ellesmere (92\% of total abundance CPUE),
   potentially indicating that these two species may directly compete for
   food resources. These findings again highlighted the importance of C.
   zealandicus in sustaining the fish populations of the lake.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Kelly, DJ (Corresponding Author), Dept Conservat, Res Dev \& Improvement Div, POB 13049, Christchurch, New Zealand.

   Atlantic Islands: understanding past marine resource use",RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY,2012,26,20,2399-2406,OCT 30,"RATIONALE Carbon (d13C) and nitrogen (d15N) analysis has been
   extensively used to investigate the importance of marine foods in the
   diet of archaeological populations in the North Atlantic Islands;
   however, few faunal studies exist to aid the interpretation of results.
   Palaeoenvironmental modelling of d13C and d15N values is crucial in
   determining whether changes in the stable isotope values are a result of
   dietary change, rather than temporal or geographical fluctuations in
   carbon and nitrogen. Investigating faunal dietary behaviour can provide
   an insight into past foddering and land management strategies. METHODS
   Detailed sampling of wild and domestic species for bulk collagen
   analysis was undertaken in order to characterise geographical variations
   in d13C and d15N values in the Outer Hebrides and Orkney. Samples from
   the Neolithic to the Norse period were analysed to assess temporal and
   geographical variations in d13C and d15N values, in addition to
   determining the contribution of marine foods to the diet of local fauna.
   RESULTS A d15N shift of 1 parts per thousand was observed between the
   Outer Hebrides and Orkney in the Neolithic and Iron Age. A geographical
   variation in d13C values was observed in the Norse period between Orkney
   and the Outer Hebrides. Temporal fluctuations in d13C and d15N values
   demonstrate variations in foddering practices of sheep in the Outer
   Hebrides. Pig specimens from the Outer Hebrides demonstrated evidence of
   marine food consumption in the Iron Age. CONCLUSIONS Faunal dietary
   behaviour can act as a vital indicator of the importance of marine
   resources in the past. Characterisation of faunal d13C and d15N values
   geographically and temporally is crucial in our interpretation of human
   dietary behaviour. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Jones, JR (Corresponding Author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Hist Archaeol \& Relig, Humanities Bldg,Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.

   Resident Stock or Trapped by a Storm Surge Barrier?",PLOS ONE,2013,8,3,NA,MAR 6,"Coastal protection measures are planned and executed worldwide to combat
   the effects of global warming and climate change, in particular the
   acceleration of sea level rise, higher storm surge flooding and
   extensive coastal inundation. The extent to which these defensive
   measures may impact coastal and estuarine ecosystems is still poorly
   understood. Since the building of a storm surge barrier, movement of
   harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena in and out of the Eastern Scheldt
   tidal bay (SW-Netherlands) may be limited. To measure residency,
   porpoises stranded along the Dutch North Sea coast between 2006 and 2008
   were sampled for muscle (n = 102) and bone tissue (n = 118), of which 9
   muscle (8.8 parts per thousand) and 12 bone samples (10.2 parts per
   thousand) were collected from animals stranded within the Eastern
   Scheldt. Stable carbon (delta C-13) was analysed to get insight into the
   habitat use and residency of porpoises in the Eastern Scheldt. Our data
   showed significantly higher delta C-13 values in the muscle of porpoises
   stranded within the Eastern Scheldt (mu = -17.7\%, SD = 0.4 parts per
   thousand) compared to animals stranded along the Dutch coast (mu = 218.3
   parts per thousand, SD = 0.5 parts per thousand). This suggests that
   most porpoises stranded in the Eastern Scheldt foraged there for a
   longer period. The distinct delta C-13 signature of animals from the
   Eastern Scheldt was not observed in bone tissue, suggesting a relatively
   recent shift in habitat use rather than life-long residency of porpoises
   within the Eastern Scheldt. The high number of strandings within the
   Eastern Scheldt suggests a higher mortality rate compared to the Dutch
   coastal zone. Our study indicates that along with other changes in the
   physical environment, the storm surge barrier may play an important role
   in determining the residency of porpoises in the Eastern Scheldt, and
   that the area might act as an ecological trap for porpoises entering it.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Article,English,"Jansen, OE (Corresponding Author), Wageningen UR, IMARES, Dept Ecosyst, Den Burg, Netherlands.

   acutorostrata</i>) inferred from regional variation of elemental and
   stable isotopic signatures in tissues",JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS,2003,43,1-2,1-17,SEP,"Information on population structure is essential for estimating
   population demographics and managing the impacts of exploitation of
   North Atlantic minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). New approaches
   including assessment of geochemical signatures in tissues can assist in
   defining such structure.
   This study determined regional variations in long-term elemental
   diagnostics of stock differences among 159 minke whales harvested in
   West Greenland, the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea in 1998.
   The diagnostics tested included mercury (Hg), selenium (Se) and cadmium
   (Cd) in various tissues, and the trace and major element composition of
   baleen. Supporting data was also gathered on delta(15)N and delta(13)C
   and stable lead isotope ratios.
   For female whales, significant differences in at least one long-term
   diagnostic element occurred between several areas. Existence of the
   following population substructure was inferred: (a) West Greenland, (b)
   a central group represented by whales from Jan Mayen, (c) a northeastern
   stock encompassing the Barents Sea, Svalbard and coastal Norway, and (d)
   the North Sea. These groups were consistent with those defined
   genetically by Andersen et al. {[}Mar. Ecol., Prog. Ser. 247 (2003)
   263]. Males appeared to fall into similar groupings to females but
   because of smaller sample sizes fewer significant differences occurred
   between areas.
   Stable-isotopic values in minke whales suggested lower trophic-level
   feeding in this species than hitherto suspected, with significant
   dietary differences between areas. Variations in feeding habits appeared
   to explain part of the geographical variation in tissue Cd, but not
   tissue Hg or Se.
   Differences among elements with a relatively long biological half-life
   in specific tissues suggested that groups of minke whales have fidelity
   to certain summer feeding areas at least for several years. Crown

   Mediterranean rice fields",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,2015,511,NA,288-297,APR 1,"Waterbirds can reallocate a considerable amount of nutrients within
   agricultural fields and between agriculture sites and wetlands. However
   their effects on biogeochemical cycles have rarely been quantified. We
   estimated bird numbers, diet (from stable isotope analysis), food
   supply, and the food consumption on rice fields by overwintering
   waterbirds in one of the most important areas for rice production in
   southwestern Europe and a key area for various migrating and resident
   waterbird species. Herein, we modelled the nutrient (N and P) recycling
   in rice fields, and their transport to reservoirs. The energy
   consumption by waterbirds (96,605 +/- 18,311 individuals) on rice fields
   during winter averaged at 89.9 +/- 39.0 kJ.m(-2), with its majority
   (89.9\%) belonging to foraging on rice seeds. Thus, the birds removed
   about 26\% of rice seeds leftover after harvest (estimated in 932.5 +/-
   504.7 seeds.m(-2) in early winter) wherein common cranes and dabbling
   ducks (four species) were the most important consumers. Waterbirds
   foraging and roosting in the rice fields recycled more than 24.1 (1.0
   kg.ha(-1)) of N and an additional 5.0 tons (0.2 kg.ha(-1)) of P in the
   Extremadura's rice fields during winter. Additionally, we estimated that
   23 tons of N and 550 kg of P were removed from rice fields and
   transported to reservoirs. The seasonal foraging of wildlife should
   result in a direct benefit for rice farmers by improving nutrient
   recycling through defecation by waterbirds with respect to artificial
   fertilisation. Additionally, rice fields located in the cranes' core
   wintering areas can provide sufficient food supply to induce habitat
   shift from their traditional wintering habitat in `clehesas' to rice
   fields, which causes indirect socioeconomic benefit through reduced
   acorn consumption by cranes. Our modelling approach may thus be
   especially helpful for management decisions regarding rice
   agroecosystems in areas which are also important for the conservation of
   migratory waterbirds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Navedo, JG (Corresponding Author), Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Marinas \& Limnol, Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia 5090000, Chile.

Article,Solveig Bourgeois and Philippe Kerherve and Maria Ll. Calleja and Gael Many and Nathalie Morata,"Glacier inputs influence organic matter composition and prokaryotic
   distribution in a high Arctic fjord (Kongsfjorden, Svalbard)",JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS,2016,164,NA,112-127,DEC,"With climate change, the strong seasonality and tight pelagic-benthic
   coupling in the Arctic is expected to change in the next few decades. It
   is currently unclear how the benthos will be affected by changes of
   environmental conditions such as supplies of organic matter (OM) from
   the water column. In the last decade, Kongsfjorden (79 degrees N), a
   high Arctic fjord in Svalbard influenced by several glaciers and
   Atlantic water inflow, has been a site of great interest owing to its
   high sensitivity to climate change, evidenced by a reduction in ice
   cover and an increase in melting freshwater. To investigate how spatial
   and seasonal changes in vertical fluxes can impact the benthic
   compartment of Kongsfjorden, we studied the organic matter
   characteristics (in terms of quantity and quality) and prokaryotic
   distribution in sediments from 3 stations along a transect extending
   from the glacier into the outer fjord in 4 different seasons (spring,
   summer, autumn and winter) in 2012-2013. The biochemical parameters used
   to describe the sedimentary organic matter were organic carbon (OC),
   total nitrogen, bulk stable isotope ratios, pigments (chorophyll-a and
   phaeopigments) and biopolymeric carbon (BPC), which is the sum of the
   main macromolecules, i.e. lipids, proteins and carbohydrates.
   Prokaryotic abundance and distribution were estimated by
   4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. This study identifies a
   well-marked quantitative gradient of biogenic compounds throughout all
   seasons and also highlights a discrepancy between the quantity and
   quality of sedimentary organic matter within the fjord. The sediments
   near the glacier were organic-poor (<0.3\%OC), however the high primary
   productivity in the water column displayed during spring was reflected
   in summer sediments, and exhibited higher freshness of material at the
   inner station compared to the outer basin (means C-chlorophyll-a/OC
   similar to 5 and 1.5\%, respectively). However, sediments at the glacier
   front were depleted in BPC (similar to 02-0.3 mg C g(-1) DW) by 4.5 and
   9 times compared to sediments from the inner and outer stations. delta
   C-13 values in sedimentary organic matter of Kongsfjorden varied between
   23.8 and 19.3\% and reflected distinct sources of organic matter between
   basins. Bacterial total cell numbers in sediments of Kongsfjorden were
   <2 x 10(8) cells ml(-1) and the prokaryotic community structure was
   strongly influenced by the marked environmental biogenic gradients.
   Overall, the spatial variability prevailed over the seasonal variability
   in sediments of Kongsfjorden suggesting that glacier inputs prominently
   control the functioning of this benthic ecosystem and its communities.

   assess carbon flow and trophic structures of sympagic, pelagic and
   benthic communities in high-Arctic Svalbard. Three regions were sampled:
   Northwest Svalbard - dominated by Atlantic water (AtW) and limited
   seasonal sea ice; Northern Svalbard - dominated by AtW and perennial sea
   ice; and Northeast Svalbard - dominated by Arctic water (ArW) and
   extensive seasonal sea ice. Three to four trophic levels (TL) were found
   in the three habitats, with a dominance of omnivores (TL = 2.4-2.7). Ice
   fauna relied on phytoplankton and ice algae, zooplankton primarily on
   phytoplankton, while benthos relied on ice algae/refractory material.
   Ice fauna (mean 39\%; range 17-62\%) and benthos (mean 25\%; range
   11-65\%) had high proportions of diatom-FATMs, while zooplankton had
   equally high diatom- and Phaeocystis/dinoflagellate-FATMs (mean 11\% and
   15\%, respectively). Calanus-FATMs were prominent in carnivorous ice
   fauna (up to 28\%) and zooplankton (up to 38\%), but also in benthic
   invertebrates (up to 41\%). Ice fauna biomass was low. Biomass of
   zooplankton and benthic infauna were variable, but positively correlated
   to each other (r(2)=0.89; p<0.01) and sedimentary pigment concentrations
   (r(2)>0.40; p<0.05). The coinciding peak biomasses of zooplankton and

   of Cookiecutter Sharks",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2021,11,1,NA,JUN 3,"The Cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis) is an ectoparasitic,
   mesopelagic shark that is known for removing plugs of tissue from larger
   prey, including teleosts, chondrichthyans, cephalopods, and marine
   mammals. Although this species is widely distributed throughout the
   world's tropical and subtropical oceanic waters, like many deep-water
   species, it remains very poorly understood due to its mesopelagic
   distribution. We used a suite of biochemical tracers, including stable
   isotope analysis (SIA), fatty acid analysis (FAA), and environmental DNA
   (eDNA), to investigate the trophic ecology of this species in the
   Central Pacific around Hawaii. We found that large epipelagic prey
   constituted a relatively minor part of the overall diet. Surprisingly,
   small micronektonic and forage species (meso- and epipelagic) are the
   most important prey group for Cookiecutter sharks across the studied
   size range (17-43 cm total length), with larger mesopelagic species or
   species that exhibit diel vertical migration also being important prey.
   These results were consistent across all the tracer techniques employed.
   Our results indicate that Cookiecutter sharks play a unique role in
   pelagic food webs, feeding on prey ranging from the largest apex
   predators to small, low trophic level species, in particular those that
   overlap with the depth distribution of the sharks throughout the diel
   cycle. We also found evidence of a potential shift in diet and/or
   habitat with size and season. Environmental DNA metabarcoding revealed
   new prey items for Cookiecutter sharks while also demonstrating that
   eDNA can be used to identify recent prey in stomachs frozen for extended
   periods. Integrating across chemical tracers is a powerful tool for
   investigating the ecology of elusive and difficult to study species,
   such as meso- and bathypelagic chondrichthyans, and can increase the
   amount of information gained from small sample sizes. Better resolving
   the foraging ecology of these mesopelagic predators is critical for
   effective conservation and management of these taxa and ecosystems,
   which are intrinsically vulnerable to overfishing and exploitation.",NATURE PORTFOLIO,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Article,English,"Carlisle, AB (Corresponding Author), Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci \& Policy, Lewes, DE 19958 USA.

   cultural dynamics and interplay of millets and rice in the Chengdu
   Plain, China during the Late Neolithic (2500-2000 cal. BC)",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2021,175,4,762-776,AUG,"Objectives: We undertook a more comprehensive analyses than our previous
   study (Yi et al., International Journal of Osteoarchaeology, 2018, 28,
   636-644) at the Gaoshan site (similar to 2500-2000 cal. BC) to expand
   our understanding of the different roles of rice and millets to human
   subsistence strategies, diachronic shift of human diets, diversity of
   human life histories and cultural influence (dental ablation) to human
   population.
   Materials and Methods: Carbon and nitrogen isotopic analyses of human
   (ribs and long bones, n = 68) and animal (n = 15) bones as well as
   carbonized seeds from rice and millets (n = 8) were undertaken. Human
   bones were directly AMS-C-14 dated. In addition, sequential sampling of
   16 individuals with varied age and sex and cultural contexts for
   isotopic analysis was also conducted.
   Results: The calibrated dating results (n = 27) indicate that there
   existed two periods of occupation at the site, similar to 2500-2200 BC
   and similar to 2200-1900 BC. Moderate high delta N-15 values were found
   in the crops. Isotopic data from bone collagen suggest that the humans
   mainly relied on C-3-based animal protein and were supplemented by
   C-4-based foods. This isotopic pattern is also seen in pigs. Significant
   difference of human delta C-13 values (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05)
   between the two periods was observed. Compared to the bones, the
   isotopic data of human dentine serial sections show a much wider
   variability and higher delta C-13 values.
   Discussion: The crops (millets and rice) were probably manured. Human
   individuals subsisted on rice/millet agriculture and pigs in general. In
   combination with the radiocarbon dates, the increase of C-3 (rice)
   consumption by the humans was found from the early (2500-2200 cal. BC)
   to late (2200-2000 cal. BC) periods, indicating the intensification of
   rice agriculture through time. However, four categories of human life
   histories during childhood are identified given different isotopic
   profiles of dentine sections, demonstrating that C-3 (rice) and C-4
   (millets)-based foods played different roles in human lives. Even
   though, there were similar weaning practices among the human
   populations. It is surprising that human individuals with dental
   ablation, cultural characteristic in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River
   Valley, consumed more millets during childhood in the early period than
   those without dental ablation in the late period. Our study here
   provides novel insights into cultural dynamics and the interplay between
   rice and millets in rice-millet agricultural system during the Late
   Neolithic in Southwest China.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Yuan, HB (Corresponding Author), Sichuan Univ, Sch Archaeol \& Museol, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China.

   increasing CO2 emissions). Although CC is often considered to be
   overexploited by industrial fisheries, we could not detect a decline in
   Cory's shearwater trophic level indicating a change in the trophic web
   structuring, as revealed by delta(15) N. We found negative correlations
   of delta C-13 and delta N-15 with the CC upwelling intensity, indicating
   annual variability in baseline isotopic levels propagates through the
   food chain and it integrates in predators' tissues. Low individual
   repeatabilities among years at population level indicates low long-term
   specialization, suggesting long-lived individuals foraging on highly
   productive areas can adjust their foraging strategies and diet according
   to environmental variability. However, individual-level repeatabilities
   in isotopic values showed a range of individual specialization within
   the population, indicating most individuals are generalist and a few of
   them highly specialized. First, although we found a clear influence of
   the upwelling intensity on the trophic ecology of birds, we could not
   detect any temporal trend in the trophic level of the Cory's shearwater
   population, suggesting a stability in the structure of the pelagic food
   web of the CC over the last two decades despite the fishing pressure.
   Second, the existence of individual specialization highlights the
   importance of considering the repeated sampling of individuals to detect
   small changes in the trophic ecology of a population. Finally, the
   coexistence of individuals with different degree of specialization (from
   extremely flexible {[}generalists] to highly consistent individuals
   {[}specialists]) within a population can have deep implications on the
   capacity of populations to cope with environmental change.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Ramos, R (Corresponding Author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Biodivers Res Inst IRBio, Av Diagonal 643, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.

   forager",POPULATION ECOLOGY,2011,53,4,535-548,OCT,"The ability of invasive mammals to adjust their diet in response to new
   or variable resources is often proposed to explain their invasion
   success on islands with differing environmental conditions, especially
   islands with strong spatiotemporal changes in the nature and abundance
   of their resources. In this study, we investigated how habitat
   heterogeneity and seasonal fluctuation in resource quality affect
   dietary breadth and plasticity in an island-invasive rodent, the black
   rat Rattus rattus, on a small Mediterranean island. We tested for
   dietary plasticity of rats at both the individual and population levels
   by using traditional dietary and stable isotope analyses at successively
   increasing time scales, coupled with a long-term study of individual
   rats in three habitats of close proximity. Dietary and movement analyses
   both indicated that R. rattus is able to exploit a wide range of
   resources and habitats. However, dietary plasticity and habitat breadth
   were far narrower at the individual level. Results revealed that rats
   exclusively used resources found in their local habitat, and very few
   individuals moved among adjacent habitats in pursuit of higher-quality
   resources, despite those resources being abundant in their immediate
   environment. This counterintuitive finding suggests that intraspecific
   interactions must restrict rat mobility. Our results suggest that even
   on small islands, accessibility of patchy and high-quality resources to
   individuals from the entire population is not systematic. This result
   has important implications when quantifying invasive rodent impacts on
   patchily distributed species, especially when studies use indirect

Article,S Jennings and SPR Greenstreet and L Hill and GJ Piet and JK Pinnegar and KJ Warr,"Long-term trends in the trophic structure of the North Sea fish
   community: evidence from stable-isotope analysis, size-spectra and
   community metrics",MARINE BIOLOGY,2002,141,6,1085-1097,DEC,"Fishing has wide-ranging impacts on marine ecosystems. One of the most
   pervasive signs of intensive fishing is ``fishing down the food web{''},
   with landings increasingly dominated by smaller species from lower
   trophic levels. Decreases in the trophic level of landings are assumed
   to reflect those in fish communities, because size-selective mortality
   causes decreases in the relative abundance of larger species and in mean
   body size within species. However, existing analyses of fishing impacts
   on the trophic level of fish communities have focused on the role of
   changes in species composition rather than size composition. This will
   provide a biased assessment of the magnitude of fishing impacts, because
   fishes feed at different trophic levels as they grow. Here, we combine
   body size versus trophic level relationships for North Sea fishes
   (trophic level assessed using nitrogen stable-isotope analysis) with
   species-size-abundance data from two time-series of trawl-survey data
   (whole North Sea 1982-2000, central and northern North Sea 1925-1996) to
   predict long-term trends in the trophic structure of the North Sea fish
   community. Analyses of the 1982-2000 time-series showed that there was a
   slow but progressive decline in the trophic level of the demersal
   community, while there was no trend in the trophic level of the combined
   pelagic and demersal community. Analyses of the longer time-series
   suggested that there was no trend in the trophic level of the demersal
   community. We related temporal changes in trophic level to temporal
   changes in the slopes of normalised biomass size-spectra (which
   theoretically represent the trophic structure of the community), mean
   1092 body mass and mean 1092 maximum body mass. While the size-based
   metrics of community structure showed long-term trends that were
   consistent with the effects of increased fishery exploitation, these
   trends were only correlated with trophic level for the demersal
   community. Our analysis suggests that the effects of fishing on the
   trophic structure of fish communities can be much more complex than
   previously assumed. This is a consequence of sampled communities not
   reflecting all the pathways of energy transfer in a marine ecosystem and
   of the absence of historical data on temporal and spatial changes in the
   trophic level of individuals. For the North Sea fish community, changes
   in size structure due to the differential effects of fishing on species
   and populations with different life histories are a stronger and more
   universal indicator of fishing effects than changes in mean trophic
   level.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",Article,English,"Jennings, S (Corresponding Author), Ctr Environm Fisheries \& Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft NR33 OHT, Suffolk, England.

   Holocene and modern shark communities in South Brazil",MARINE BIOLOGY,2023,170,8,NA,AUG,"Sharks are essential components of marine communities, and their removal
   might simplify ecosystems and lead to unpredictable and detrimental
   effects on the food web. Comparing the isotopic niche of species between
   archaeological and modern communities can provide information to assess
   temporal changes in the ecological dynamics of communities. Here, stable
   isotope analysis was used to compare food web topology metrics between
   two shark guilds or communities, a late Holocene archaeological
   community (AC) dating from 700 to 500 years ago and a modern community
   (MC) trophic web, both from South Brazil. In the same line of
   comparison, we assess the trophic position of a top predator, Carcharias
   taurus. Results showed topological temporal differences such as higher
   trophic redundancy and higher patterns of niche overlap in the AC.
   Higher trophic redundancy could be expected in late Holocene food webs,
   as similar studies also observed these findings. In contrast, the MC
   showed less dense packing of species within the isotopic niche space,
   thus higher niche partitioning and higher trophic diversity, suggesting
   changing ecological interaction dynamics. We found that Carcharias
   taurus has increased its trophic level, possibly due to a release from
   the intraspecific competition and a dietary shift towards larger prey
   items. We suggest that anthropic impacts, such as overfishing, may cause
   these differences in the trophic position of this species. We also
   advocate that this study method might help future trophic
   reconstructions using shark teeth, as information about past marine
   environments is scarce, and could serve as a baseline for future
   studies.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",Article,English,"Mayer, GB (Corresponding Author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Ecol \& Zool, Programa Posgrad Ecol, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.

   persistence through time of the Chisel-toothed kangaroo rat",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,2017,31,10,1921-1932,OCT,"1. Rapid environmental changes are putting many species at risk,
   particularly niche specialists. In response, species can shift their
   ranges or remain in place by taking advantage of new resources. The
   potential for specialists to undergo insitu niche shifts is not well
   understood yet can buffer species from the effects of long-term
   environmental change over centuries and millennia.
   2. In the Great Basin of western North America, the Chisel-toothed
   kangaroo rat, Dipodomys microps, is a folivore thought to be an obligate
   specialist on the desert shrub Atriplex confertifolia. Because of its
   association with A. confertifolia, D. microps is presumed to have
   tracked the shrub as it moved south during the last glacial maximum.
   However, recent phylogeographic evidence indicates that D. microps did
   not shift or contract its range into a southern refugium.
   3. Here we evaluate the role that niche flexibility may have played in
   allowing this presumed dietary specialist to cope with a changing
   environment and resource base. We do so using carbon and nitrogen
   isotopes measured in D. microps bone collagen from modern and fossil
   specimens spanning the last 8000years at Two Ledges Chamber (TLC) in
   northwestern Nevada.
   4.delta C-13 values indicate that, contrary to expectation, the
   population of D. microps at TLC consumes a variety of plants other than
   A. confertifolia, an isotopically distinct C4 shrub, and has done so for
   millennia. Mixing models suggest that the proportion of C4 in the diet
   was highest (similar to 35\%) in the middle Holocene, and has declined
   towards the recent, especially over the last 30years. delta N-15 values
   are consistently elevated through time, suggesting that D.microps at TLC
   are potentially also consuming a high proportion of insects.
   5. Our results indicate that this population of dietary specialists has
   greater niche flexibility than previously assumed. This implies that, at
   the species level, even presumed niche specialists may be capable of
   undergoing niche shifts over centennial to millennial time-scales in
   response to changing environmental conditions, and highlights the unique
   role that historical and paleontological data can play in establishing

   bottom-feeding fish in a tropical floodplain",ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,2015,98,4,1081-1088,APR,"Bottom-feeding fish show great variation in trophic morphology,
   resulting in a wide array of feeding habits exploiting from periphyton
   in littoral habitats to ingesting larger amounts of litterfall from
   terrestrial habitats. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that, in
   temperate aquatic systems, the energetic demands from bottom-feeding
   fish are supplied by primary production from phytoplankton in pelagic
   habitats. Thus, we aimed to determine which of several energy sources
   support bottom-feeding fish in tropical aquatic systems, where primary
   producers are diverse. We performed samplings in the Parana River
   floodplain from primary producers in littoral (periphyton), pelagic
   (phytoplankton) and terrestrial habitats (riparian vegetation). Using
   simultaneous signatures of C and N isotope ratios, we analysed the
   possible origin of available energy in muscles of nine different
   bottom-feeding fish species. We verified that seven of the nine fish
   species had the highest contribution of carbon from a littoral source
   compared to other energy sources, independent of trophic category. The
   importance of periphyton may be related to the high abundance of
   substrates (such as macrophytes) that are available in the littoral zone
   of tropical aquatic systems. Finally, we suggest that the actual carbon
   dynamics among bottom-feeding fish and primary producers is
   species-specific, varying within the same trophic guild, and therefore,
   it is possible to refute the assumption that each trophic guild is

   changes among north-central Iberian megalithic groups",JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE,2021,133,NA,NA,SEP,"The insufficient attention traditionally paid to the complex mortuary
   biographies of megalithic graves has long obscured a significant amount
   of synchronic and diachronic information. The Rioja Alavesa region of
   north-central Iberia holds a number of megalithic graves with large
   skeletal assemblages that can generally be ordered by internal
   stratigraphy and/or relatively fine-grained radiocarbon chronologies,
   providing a rare opportunity to assess the potential of such
   information. Here, we undertake stable carbon and nitrogen isotope
   analyses of 125 human and seven animal bone collagen samples from six
   late prehistoric megalithic graves (La Cascaja, El Sotillo, San Martin,
   Alto de la Huesera, Chabola de la Hechicera and Longar) which, together
   with 107 previously published Late Neolithic/Early Chalcolithic (ca.
   3600-2900 BC) bone collagen samples (100 humans and six animals) from
   the same tombs, are used to explore subsistence trends over time. This
   approach provides a means to address the socio-economic response of
   northern Iberian megalithic communities to the cultural and climatic
   changes occurring in late prehistory. Isotopic data are contextualized
   using palaeoenvironmental and osteoarchaeological information. The
   results show a significant shift in diet between the late Middle
   Neolithic and the Late Neolithic/Early Chalcolithic that coincides with
   marked changes in burial practices that are likely related to the
   transition from mainly pastoral to mixed farming economies. There may
   also be a change in subsistence between the Late Neolithic/Early
   Chalcolithic and the following periods, suggested by differences in
   delta N-15 values between the layers of the Alto de la Huesera
   megalithic grave, as well as in population and funerary dynamics. By
   contrast, an apparent continuity in subsistence is seen, at least
   isotopically, from the Middle Chalcolithic to the Bronze Age, despite
   clear changes in beliefs and socio-economic practices. These findings
   support the existence of substantial asynchronous changes in lifeways
   and ideology among Iberian megalithic groups and challenge the
   traditional idea of a long and uniform stability in late prehistoric
   northern Iberia.",ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Fernández-Crespo, T (Corresponding Author), Aix Marseille Univ, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, UMR 7269, Maison Mediterraneenne Sci Homme,Lab Mediterranee, 5 Rue Chateau Horloge,BP647, F-13097 Aix En Provence, France.

   herbivores. Hence, understanding the dietary strategies of fossil
   herbivores and the associated temporal changes is one aspect of
   inferring paleoenvironmental conditions. Here, we present carbon isotope
   data from more than 1,050 fossil teeth that record the dietary patterns
   of nine herbivore families in the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene
   (3.6 to 1.05 Ma) from the Shungura Formation, a hominin-bearing site in
   southwestern Ethiopia. An increasing trend toward C-4 herbivory has been
   observed with attendant reductions in the proportions of browsers and
   mixed feeders through time. A high proportion of mixed feeders has been
   observed prior to 2.9 Ma followed by a decrease in the proportion of
   mixed feeders and an increase in grazers between 2.7 and 1.9 Ma, and a
   further increase in the proportion of grazers after 1.9 Ma. The
   collective herbivore fauna shows two major change points in carbon
   isotope values at similar to 2.7 and similar to 2.0 Ma. While hominin
   fossils from the sequence older than 2.7 Ma are attributed to
   Australopithecus, the shift at similar to 2.7 Ma indicating the
   expansion of C-4 grasses on the landscape was concurrent with the first
   appearance of Paranthropus. The link between the increased C-4 herbivory
   and more open landscapes suggests that Australopithecus lived in more
   wooded landscapes compared to later hominins such as Paranthropus and
   Homo, and has implications for key morphological and behavioral
   adaptations in our lineage.",NATL ACAD SCIENCES,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",Article,English,"Negash, EW (Corresponding Author), George Washington Univ, Ctr Adv Study Human Paleobiol, Washington, DC 20052 USA.

   δ<SUP>15</SUP>N analysis",DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS,2011,58,1,98-109,JAN,"The food-web structure of the epibenthic and infaunal invertebrates on
   the continental slope of the Catalan Sea (Balearic basin, NW
   Mediterranean) was investigated using carbon and nitrogen stable
   isotopes on a total of 34 species, and HPLC pigment analyses for three
   key species. Samples were collected close to Barcelona (NE Iberian
   Peninsula), between 650 and 800 m depth and between February 2007 and
   February 2008. Mean delta C-l3 values ranged from -21.0\%o (small
   Calocaris macandreae and Amphipholis squamata) to -14.5\% (Sipunculus
   norvegicus). Values of delta N-15 ranged from 4.0 parts per thousand (A.
   squamata) to 12.1 parts per thousand. (Molpadia musculus). The stable
   isotope ratios of benthic fauna displayed a continuum of values (e.g.
   delta N-15 range of 8 parts per thousand), confirming a wide spectrum of
   feeding strategies (from active suspension feeders to predators) and
   complex food webs. According to the available information on diets of
   benthic fauna, the lowest values were found for surface deposit feeders
   (small C. macandrae and the two ophiuroids A. squamata and Amphiura
   chiajei) and active suspension feeders (Abra longicallus and Scalpellum
   scalpellum) feeding on different sizes of particulate organic matter
   (POM), among which small particles may exhibit lower delta N-15. High
   annual mean delta N-15 values were found among sub-surface deposit
   feeders, exploiting refractory or frequently recycled organic matter
   that is enriched in delta N-15. Carnivorous polychaetes (Nephtys spp.,
   Oenonidae and Polynoidae) and large decapods (Geryon longipes and
   Paromola cuvieri) also displayed high delta N-15 values. delta C-13
   ranges were particularly wide among surface deposit feeders (ranging
   from -21.0 parts per thousand to -16.4 parts per thousand), suggesting
   exploitation of POM of both terrigenous and oceanic origins. Correlation
   between delta C-13 and delta N-15 was generally weak, indicating
   multiple carbon sources, likely due to the consumption of different
   kinds of sinking particles (e.g. marine snow, phytodetritus, etc.),
   sedimented and frequently recycled POM, together with macrophyte
   remains. The stronger delta C-13-6 delta(5N) correlations found in
   February and April suggest that during the period of water column
   homogeneization (winter-spring), the benthic community was sustained by
   phytodetritus inputs originating from the peak of surface primary
   production in February. Conversely, weaker delta C-13-delta N-15
   correlations were observed during the period of water column
   stratification (beginning in June-July), suggesting that the benthic
   community in this period was sustained, with a delay of ca. 2/3 months,
   by multiple carbon sources including continental inputs from river
   discharge (with the maxima in April-May). Thus both advective and
   vertical fluxes seem to be food sources for benthos on the Catalonian
   slope. Pigments in the guts of key species were generally degraded, and
   only the active suspension feeder A. longicallus ingested fresh
   chlorophyll during periods of high primary production at the surface
   (February and April 2007). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

   in invaded coastal systems of the Apulia region (SE Italy): A stable
   isotope analysis",ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,2017,198,"B, SI",421-431,NOV 5,"The Atlantic blue crab Callinectes sapidus is recognized as an Invasive
   Alien Species in the Mediterranean Sea. However, its trophic role and
   feeding flexibility in invaded benthic food webs have been addressed
   only recently. Here, field samplings were conducted in winter and summer
   in five coastal systems of the Apulia region (SE Italy), three located
   on the Ionian Sea (Mar Piccolo, Torre Colimena, and Spunderati) and two
   on the Adriatic Sea (Acquatina and Alimini Grande). Captured blue crabs
   were weighed and had their delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic signatures
   measured; their trophic level (TL) was estimated using the mussel
   Mytilus galloprovincialis as isotopic baseline.
   C. sapidus abundances varied greatly across systems and seasons, and in
   Adriatic systems the species was not collected in winter. Trophic levels
   showed significant spatial and temporal variations, although with no
   general pattern. In winter, the Mar Piccolo population showed the
   highest TL values; the lowest estimates were in Torre Colimena and
   Spunderati, where crabs showed delta C-13 signatures significantly
   higher than mussels, suggesting the contribution of C-13-enriched plant
   material in the diet. In summer, with the exception of the Mar Piccolo,
   Ionian populations increased their trophic level; both Adriatic
   populations were characterized by the lowest TL estimates. The analysis
   performed at the individual scale further indicated body weight-related
   changes in trophic level. For the Torre Colimena population, in
   particular, a hump-shaped pattern was observed in both seasons. The
   present study highlighted a considerable spatial and temporal trophic
   flexibility of C. sapidus at the population scale, while at the
   individual scale size-related shifts in trophic level were observed. The
   ability of the blue crab to vary its energy sources in relation with
   season, local environmental conditions, and ontogenetic stage is
   emphasized, suggesting that it may represent a key determinant of its
   invasion success. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

   and the Middle Ages in Tuscany",JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS,2020,33,NA,NA,OCT,"The transition from Late Antiquity to the Medieval period is considered
   one of the greatest periods of social, political, and economic upheaval
   in Europe, and has left its mark on the historical consciousness of
   people in this part of the world. Nevertheless, there remains
   considerable debate as to the degree to which the diets and economic
   status of different sections of society were impacted by this
   transition, with these so-called `Dark Ages' often being uniformly
   considered as static and impoverished, particularly for populations
   along the Mediterranean rim. Such questions are especially important in
   central Italy, with its position at the former core of the Roman Empire
   leaving it most vulnerable to the major social and political shifts of
   the first millennium AD. However, direct insights into the diets of
   individuals in this region, across this key period, have been scarce,
   particularly in diachronic perspective. Here, we apply stable carbon
   (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) analysis to bone collagen (n =
   76), and stable carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope
   analysis to tooth enamel (n = 34), to human, and associated faunal,
   individuals dated to Late Antiquity (3rd-5th centuries AD) and the
   Medieval period (mid 6th-mid 13th centuries AD) in Tuscany. delta C-13
   measurements of both tooth enamel bioapatite and bone collagen suggest
   that a predominantly C-3 diet during Late Antiquity was gradually
   supplemented by increased C-4 consumption during the Medieval period. We
   interpret this as a shift from an agricultural focus on wheat following
   the Roman agrarian tradition towards the inclusion of millet as a
   reliable fallback food. We argue that this was part of a growing local
   and regional resilience amongst communities in the Medieval period, with
   more diverse agricultural systems and cultural preferences following a
   transition from the Roman classical civilization toward a Germanic
   tradition whose economy was based on the diverse cultivation of ``minor
   crops{''} and close integration of pastoral husbandry livestock.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Riccomi, G (Corresponding Author), Univ Pisa, Dept Translat Res \& New Technol Med \& Surg, Div Paleopathol, Pisa, Italy.

   consequences of climate change",DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY,2013,95,NA,129-138,OCT 15,"Southern Ocean squid are important predators and prey and are a
   potential fishery resource. Their future under climate change is
   analysed from predictions of change by 2100 and assessments of the
   effects on squid biology. There are similar to 18 Antarctic species of
   squid. Young feed primarily on crustaceans and switch later to fishes.
   They are preyed on by odontocetes, seals and seabirds - which together
   consume similar to 34 x 10(6) t yr(-1) - and fish. As predators, squid
   are second to fish as biomass producers but recent evidence suggests
   predator consumption of squid needs to be reassessed. Fatty acid
   composition and stable nitrogen isotope ratios indicate some predators
   consume less squid in their diet than gut contents data suggest.
   Southern Ocean oceanography is unique in having circumpolar circulation
   and frontal systems and at high latitudes it is heavily influenced by
   sea ice. The Antarctic Peninsula is among the fastest warming regions
   worldwide but elsewhere the Southern Ocean is warming more slowly and
   the Ross Sea is probably cooling. Sea ice is receding in the Peninsula
   region and increasing elsewhere. Modelled predictions for 2100 suggest
   although the Southern Ocean will warm less than other oceans and sea ice
   will reduce. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current may shift slightly
   southwards with intensification of westerly winds but resolution of the
   models is insufficient to predict mesoscale change. Globally, pH of
   seawater has decreased by 0.1 units since the mid-1900s and is predicted
   to decrease by another 0.5 units by 2100. Impact on calcifying organisms
   will be high in the cold Southern Ocean where solubility of calcium
   carbonate is high. Predicted temperature increases are unlikely to have
   major effects on squid other than changes in distribution near the
   limits of their range; acidification may have greater impact. Small
   changes in large scale circulation are unlikely to affect squid but
   changes in mesoscale oceanography may have high impact. Change in sea
   ice extent may not have a direct effect but consequent ecosystem changes
   could have a major impact. Cephalopods are ecological opportunists
   adapted to exploit favourable environmental conditions. Given their
   potential to evolve fast, change in the Southern Ocean pelagic ecosystem
   might act in their favour. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Rodhouse, PGK (Corresponding Author), British Antarctic Survey, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.

   austral high-latitude ecosystem (Beagle Channel): The role of bottom-up
   and top-down forces during springtime",JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS,2023,240,NA,NA,MAY,"High-latitude marine environments, such as the Beagle Channel, are
   highly vulnerable to modifications related to climate change and
   anthropogenic impacts, which can rapidly affect the ecological
   attributes of plankton communities and thus alter ecosystem
   trophodynamics. This study compares the mesozooplankton community
   structure in the inner and outer (eastern) Beagle Channel during spring
   and assesses the interactions of the main mesozooplankton trophic groups
   with lower and higher trophic level organisms under an isotopic
   approach. Oceanographic data and biological samples, ranging from
   sediment and phytoplankton to pelagic squat lobsters (Grimothea
   gregaria), were collected along the channel during two research cruises
   conducted in November 2019. Mesozooplankton abundance and taxonomic
   composition differed between sectors, in agreement with their distinct
   environmental conditions. The inner sector was dominated by copepods,
   mainly Clausocalanidae spp., followed by cirripede and echinoderm larvae
   and appendicularians. In the outer sector, with shallower, saltier, and
   warmer waters than the inner one, mesozooplankton abundances were
   notably higher and both copepods and decapod larvae, mainly Peltarion
   spinosulum and G. gregaria zoeae, were dominant. This pattern in
   meroplankton abundance was consistent with the bathymetric distribution
   reported for benthic adults. Betweensector differences in taxonomic
   composition, e.g., Macruronus novaezelandiae (hake) larvae occurring
   only in the outer sector, may be attributed to the higher connectivity
   between this sector and the open ocean and the semi-enclosed character
   of the inner channel. Mesozooplankton spatial variability was partially
   reflected in the isotopic niche width of their different trophic groups
   such as copepods, euphausiids and decapod larvae. However, at the
   community level, trophic attributes (i.e., baseline resources, trophic
   positions, isotopic diversity metrics) were quite similar in the two
   sectors, suggesting similar basal and vertical trophic structures.
   According to Bayesian stable isotope mixing models, most trophic groups,
   including pelagic G. gregaria, rely on phytoplankton as their main
   carbon source. This reveals a weak predation pressure on mesozooplankton
   by the squat lobster and reinforces a bottom-up regulation during the
   spring season. This study contributes to our knowledge of trophic
   interactions in plankton communities and how they are regulated by
   bottom-up and top-down forces, which is imperative for monitoring and
   management purposes.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Presta, ML (Corresponding Author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas \& Nat, Dept Biodivers \& Biol Expt DBBE, Intendente Guiraldes 2160,C1428EGA, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

   37,000 cal BP) and in different regions of Europe. The isotopic evidence
   indicates that in all cases Neanderthals were top-level carnivores and
   obtained all, or most, of their dietary protein from large herbivores.
   In contrast, early modern humans (approximate to 40,000 to approximate
   to 27,000 cal BP) exhibited a wider range of isotopic values, and a
   number of individuals had evidence for the consumption of aquatic
   (marine and freshwater) resources. This pattern includes Oase 1, the
   oldest directly dated modern human in Europe (approximate to 40,000 cal
   BP) with the highest nitrogen isotope value of all of the humans
   studied, likely because of freshwater fish consumption. As Oase 1 was

   Watershed, Marine Macrophyte, and Pelagic Sources to the Northeast
   Pacific Coastal Ocean Margin",FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,2022,9,NA,NA,JUL 6,"Globally, coastal waters are considered biogeochemical hotspots because
   they receive, transform, and integrate materials and waters from both
   land and the open ocean. Extending from northern California to southeast
   Alaska, the Northeast Pacific Coastal Temperate Rainforest (NPCTR)
   region is no exception to this, and hosts a diversity of watershed types
   (old-growth rainforest, bog forest, glaciers), and tidal (sheltered,
   exposed) and pelagic marine (deep fjord, shallow estuary, well-mixed
   channel) environments. With large freshwater fluxes to the coastal
   ocean, cross-ecosystem connectivity in the NPCTR is expected to be high,
   but seasonally variable, with pulses in runoff from rainfall, snowmelt
   and glacial melt, and primary production associated with changes in
   ocean upwelling and incident light. However, the relative contribution
   of each ecosystem to surface ocean organic matter pools over time and
   space remains poorly constrained, despite their importance for the
   structure and function of coastal marine ecosystems. Here, we use a
   four-year dataset of particulate organic matter (POM) chemical
   composition (delta C-13, delta N-15, C:N ratio) to quantify the relative
   contributions of watershed materials via riverine inputs, marine
   phytoplankton, and macrophytes (macroalgae and seagrass) to surface
   waters (0-10 m) at 11 stations representing fjord, shallow non-fjord
   estuary, sheltered channel and well-mixed coastal environments at the
   heart of the NPCTR in British Columbia, Canada. Watershed, marine
   phytoplankton, and macrophyte contributions to surficial POM ranged
   between 5-78\%, 22-88\%, and 0.1-18\%, respectively, and varied by
   season and station. Watershed inputs were the primary source of POM
   across all stations in winter and were important throughout the year
   within the fjord. Marine phytoplankton were the principal source of POM
   in spring and at all stations outside of the fjord through summer and
   autumn, while macrophyte contributions were greatest in summer. These
   results demonstrated high, but seasonally and spatially variable,
   connectivity between ecosystems that are often considered in isolation
   of one another and highlight the need to consider coastal waters as
   integrated land-ocean meta-ecosystems. Future work should investigate
   how heterogeneity in POM sources determines its fate in coastal

   higher trophic position of C. temensis individuals. The results
   demonstrate that in both rivers there is a gradual shift in the
   contribution of prey fish sources to the diet of C. temensis throughout

   irrespective of age, sex, and body size are either specialized or
   generalized in terms of resource use, has implications on ecological
   niches and food web structure. Niche size and degree of IS of near-top
   trophic-level marine predators have been little studied in polar regions
   or with latitude. We quantified the large-scale latitudinal variation of
   population-and individual-level niche size and IS in ringed seals (Pusa
   hispida) and beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) using stable carbon
   and nitrogen isotope analysis on 379 paired ringed seal liver and muscle
   samples and 124 paired beluga skin and muscle samples from eight
   locations ranging from the low to high Arctic. We characterized both
   within- and between-individual variation in predator niche size at each
   location as well as accounting for spatial differences in the isotopic
   ranges of potential prey. Total isotopic niche width (TINW) for
   populations of ringed seals and beluga decreased with increasing
   latitude. Higher TINW values were associated with greater ecological
   opportunity (i.e., prey diversity) in the prey fish community which
   mainly consists of Capelin (Mallotus villosus) and Sand lance (Ammodytes
   sp.) at lower latitudes and Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) at high
   latitudes. In beluga, their dietary consistency between tissues also
   known as the within-individual component (WIC) increased in a near 1: 1
   ratio with TINW (slope = 0.84), suggesting dietary generalization,
   whereas the slope (0.18) of WIC relative to TINW in ringed seals
   indicated a high degree of individual specialization in ringed seal
   populations with higher TINWs. Our findings highlight the differences in
   TINW and level of IS for ringed seals and beluga relative to latitude as
   a likely response to large-scale spatial variation in ecological

   Structure of Intertidal Salt Marshes",FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,2021,8,NA,NA,MAY 7,"Salt marshes are under increasing anthropogenic pressures that have been
   reported to affect the diet of fish (e.g., change in prey composition
   and availability), eventually resulting in alterations in their nursery
   function. Most studies in Europe are based on fish gut content analysis,
   which only reflect a small proportion of pressures to salt marshes, and
   do not necessarily reflect long-term disturbances. In this study, we
   investigated the impact of salt-marsh vegetation type on trophic network
   structures (i.e., fish diet and trophic position). Primary producers
   (particulate organic matter, microphytobenthos, and dominant terrestrial
   plants), potential aquatic and terrestrial prey, and fish of two
   dominant species (sea bass and thinlip mullet) were sampled during the
   summer of 2010 in four creeks from two sites from Western France (the
   Mont-Saint-Michel Bay and the Seine Estuary). Analysis was undertaken
   using C and N stable-isotope compositions. Tested response variables
   (diet and trophic position) suggested a dominant site effect and a
   weaker effect of surrounding vegetation type. Site effect was attributed
   to differences in anthropogenic nitrogen inputs (with a steep increase
   in the Mont-Saint Michel Bay) and tidal regime between the two bays,
   with more marine signatures associated with a higher frequency and
   duration of tidal flooding events in the Seine Estuary. A second
   hypothesis is that invasive Elytrigia acuta, which has recently replaced
   typical salt-marsh vegetation in Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, negatively
   impacted the native salt-marshes nursery function by modifying the
   access to terrestrial prey on this site. The trophic position of the sea

   independent of trophic status: Evidence from amino acid stable isotopes",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,2023,68,5,870-887,MAY,"Lakes are recipients of allochthonous organic matter and nutrients.
   However, the importance of these subsidies for food webs and how they
   vary with lake trophic status remains unclear, especially for large
   lakes. We assessed the source and fate of organic matter and nutrients
   in seven perialpine lakes across a gradient of trophic status. We
   measured carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of amino acids of
   lake-residing Atlantic trout, Salmo trutta, to determine the source of
   primary production (i.e., how carbon is fixed in the ecosystem) and how
   it is transferred through food webs, respectively. Based on essential
   amino acid carbon fingerprinting, we estimated the probability of
   organic carbon originating from autochthonous (algal), allochthonous
   (terrestrial plant), and recycled (bacterial) sources. In addition, we
   used amino acid delta N-15 to track how this primary production is
   transferred to consumers in general, and by using different trophic
   amino acids (glutamic acid and alanine), identify the trophic pathways
   involving either metazoan or protozoans. We found a high likelihood of
   autochthonous origin of organic carbon (86 +/- 9\%) in trout that
   contrasted with allochthonous origins of particulate organic matter and
   some sediments. We showed that those estimates are good proxies of
   source reliance. Our results also highlighted the importance of
   bacterial origin of organic carbon in fish (12\%). The likely
   autochthonous origin of this carbon was supported by trophic markers
   (Ala delta N-15) that suggest the role of protists in transferring
   recycled organic carbon up the food web. While the sources of nitrogen
   sustaining food webs varied among lakes, we found a conserved carbon
   fingerprinting of fish. Overall, this suggests an uncoupling between the
   source of nutrients and organic carbon in large perialpine lakes. Across
   a wide range of trophic status (c. 2 orders of magnitude range of
   phosphorus concentration), several lines of evidence suggested that
   perialpine lake food webs shared a common reliance on autochthonous and
   bacterial production. Our study is the first to quantify the dependence
   on allochthonous organic carbon in lake food webs based on new amino
   acid stable isotope markers (carbon fingerprinting and Ala delta N-15)
   and shows promise for estimating the source of carbon fixation in
   ecosystems. Our results support previous suggestions that terrestrial
   organic carbon is a relatively minor source for aquatic consumers
   despite contributing to the pool of organic matter, and more
   importantly, its contribution does not vary substantially with trophic
   status in perialpine lakes.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Article,English,"Saboret, G (Corresponding Author), Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci \& Technol, Ctr Ecol Evolut \& Biogeochem, Dept Surface Waters, EAWAG, Kastanienbaum, Switzerland.

   perspective from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B funerary site of Kfar
   HaHoresh",ENVIRONMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY,2016,21,"3, SI",199-213,NA,"Animal husbandry emerged as an important subsistence strategy at various
   tempos and trajectories across the southern Levant during the
   Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (ca. 8500-6500 cal BC). Here, we explore
   temporal variation in the emergence of animal management strategies, in
   particular those that alter the composition of the animal diet, west of
   the Jordan Valley, through carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15)
   isotopic analyses of mountain gazelle, bezoar goat and aurochsen bone
   collagen from the funerary complex of Kfar HaHoresh. Analyses presented
   here show an extended range of carbon isotope values in the collagens of
   Late Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) goats relative to Middle PPNB goats,
   which are also enriched in C-13 relative to contemporaneous gazelle.
   This shift may reflect a greater catchment from which morphologically
   wild goats derived or that some of the goats at Kfar HaHoresh were
   provided with some fodder. If the latter is the case, then the use of
   fodder by 7500 cal BC at Kfar HaHoresh is a relatively late development,
   emerging several hundred years after goat husbandry strategies
   emphasising a juvenile harvest and fodder provisioning that first came
   into use in the Mediterranean region of the southern Levant. There is a
   pronounced enrichment of nitrogen isotopes in Early PPNB aurochsen,
   ritually important animals derived from a unique feasting deposit,
   relative to that of gazelle and goats. Though this may reflect more
   specialised feeding behaviour in aurochsen compared to the other two
   bovid groups, an alternative interpretation is that the aurochsen
   ingested enriched N-15 from manured pasture, following restriction of
   their movement by people. These isotopic data support the documented
   pattern of a delayed adoption of goat husbandry in the lower Galilee
   region and may point to differential developmental trajectories where
   some forms of animal management emerged out of ritual rather than
   subsistence needs.","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Makarewicz, CA (Corresponding Author), Univ Kiel, Inst Prehist \& Protohist Archaeol, Johanna Mestorf Str 2-6, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.

   comprised of the dominant chenopods, shrubs, trees and forbs. We surmise

   responses to managed river-flows, in riffles downstream of three dams on
   the Cotter River, Australian Capital Territory. Benthic
   macroinvertebrates and periphyton were also assessed in adjacent

   its tributaries. Food sources of four macroinvertebrate taxa
   (Leptophlebiidae, Elmidae, Glossosomatidae and Orthocladiinae) were
   determined by stable isotope analysis of the invertebrates and their

   food source for the selected taxa. Orthocladiinae consumed primarily
   amorphous detritus, while Elmidae, Glossosomatidae and Leptophlebiidae
   consumed diatoms. Enclosed benthic chambers were used to measure the
   response of benthic metabolism to monthly flow spikes released from one
   of the dams. The balance of benthic metabolism as measured by the
   Production/Respiration ratio (P/R) showed a shift towards production
   after the release of flow spikes. At sites downstream of the dams, there
   was more periphyton chlorophyll-a in the form of filamentous green algae
   than at sites in the unregulated river and the tributaries, and
   macroinvertebrate taxa using periphyton as a food resource were missing
   or reduced in abundance relative to sites without dams. However, the
   site downstream of the dam with environmental flow releases had more
   macroinvertebrate taxa and less periphyton cholorophyll-a content than

   as dams, channelization, and water provision for municipalities,
   agriculture, and industry. With this growing pressure on fluvial systems
   comes a greater need to evaluate the state of their ecosystems. The
   purpose of this research is to use a geospatial model of the Qu'Appelle
   River in Saskatchewan to distinguish instream macroinvertebrate habitats
   at the family level. River geomorphology was assessed through the use of
   ArcGIS and digital elevation models; with these tools, the sinuosity,
   slope, fractal dimension, and stream width of the river were processed.
   Subsequently, Principal Component Analysis, a clustering technique,
   revealed areas with similar sets of geomorphological characteristics.
   These similar typology sequences were then grouped into geomorphological
   response units (GRUs), designated a color, and mapped into a geospatial
   model. Macroinvertebrate data was then incorporated to reveal several
   relationships to the model. For instance, certain GRUs contained more
   highly sensitive species and healthier diversity levels than others.
   Future possibilities for expanding on this project include incorporating
   stable isotope data to evaluate the food-web structure within the river
   basin. Although GRUs have been very successful in identifying fish
   habitats in other studies, the macroinvertebrates may be too sessile and
   their habitat too localized to be identified by such large river units.

   Riparian Beetles",PLOS ONE,2013,8,4,NA,APR 17,"Background: Riparian habitats are subjected to frequent inundation
   (flooding) and are characterised by food webs that exhibit variability
   in aquatic/terrestrial subsidies across the ecotone. The strength of
   this subsidy in active riparian floodplains is thought to underpin local
   biodiversity. Terrestrial invertebrates dominate the fauna, exhibiting
   traits that allow exploitation of variable aquatic subsidies while
   reducing inundation pressures, leading to inter-species micro-spatial
   positioning. The effect these strategies have on prey selection is not
   known. This study hypothesised that plasticity in prey choice from
   either aquatic or terrestrial sources is an important trait linked to
   inundation tolerance and avoidance.
   Method/Principal Findings: We used hydrological, isotopic and habitat
   analyses to investigate the diet of riparian Coleoptera in relation to
   inundation risk and relative spatial positioning in the floodplain. The
   study examined patch scale and longitudinal changes in utilisation of
   the aquatic subsidy according to species traits. Prey sourced from
   terrestrial or emerging/stranded aquatic invertebrates varied in
   relation to traits for inundation avoidance or tolerance strategies.
   Traits that favoured rapid dispersal corresponded with highest
   proportions of aquatic prey, with behavioural traits further predicting
   uptake. Less able dispersers showed minimal use of aquatic subsidy and
   switched to a terrestrial diet under moderate inundation pressures. All
   trait groups showed a seasonal shift in diet towards terrestrial prey in
   the early spring. Prey selection became exaggerated towards aquatic prey
   in downstream samples.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that partitioning of
   resources and habitat creates overlapping niches that increase the
   processing of external subsidies in riparian habitats. By demonstrating
   functional complexity, this work advances understanding of floodplain
   ecosystem processes and highlights the importance of hydrological
   variability. With an increasing interest in reconnecting rivers to their
   floodplains, these invertebrates represent a key functional element in
   ensuring that such reconnections have demonstrable ecological value.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Article,English,"O'Callaghan, MJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth \& Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.

   such as community assembly and network interactions. The study of
   natural abundances of C and N stable isotopes, C-13 and N-15, can help
   infer mechanistic hypotheses on ecosystem processes at play in urban
   environments. No existing study has investigated whether a visible urban
   effect on soil and plant C and N biogeochemistry is being transferred to
   the animal compartment of urban ecosystems through trophic interactions.
   Here, we report C-13 and N-15 natural abundance values measured on three

   morio, and Lasioglossum nitidulum) sampled in 12 locations along an

   pollinators, and to reflect on whether this would be indicative of an
   urban isotopic signal being transferred to pollinators. Results indicate
   a significant effect of urbanization on the delta C-13 and delta N-15
   for all three bee species, with enrichment for both C-13 and N-15 linked
   to increased urbanization. This could be linked to an urban imprint on
   the diverse plants on which pollinating insects forage on in the Paris
   area, or to other factors linked to the physiology and foraging
   strategies of insects. A better understanding of the drivers influencing
   pollinator delta C-13 and delta N-15 could help better understand urban
   biogeochemistry and trophic chains, as well as elucidate the origin of
   specimens and the migratory capacities of bee species, an important yet
   still elusive question considering the increase of habitat

   shelf ecosystem",PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY,2019,175,NA,105-114,JUL-AUG,"Human activities affect continental shelves, especially due to the
   harvest of living marine resources. Understanding their functioning and
   dynamics has become a growing concern in recent decades, especially
   through use of trophic modelling approaches. Studying the feeding
   ecology of key component species also improves this understanding by
   providing accurate information on trophic processes, particularly the
   dependence on trophic pathways. This study focuses on the trophic
   ecology of four large gadiforms (cod, haddock, whiting and hake) found
   on the continental shelf of the Celtic Sea. The study combines
   information on recently ingested prey (gut content analysis) and a more
   integrated indicator of food sources (stable isotope analysis). Two size
   classes of each species were considered (small and large - split around
   20 cm for haddock, whiting and hake and 60 cm for cod), as were shallow
   and deep zones. The four gadiforms show distinct feeding niches and
   strategies, which limit interspecific competition. Cod and haddock
   relied mainly on the benthic trophic pathway but differed in favouring
   piscivory and invertivory, respectively. Hake fed mainly on the pelagic
   trophic pathway, while whiting seemed to feed on both pathways.
   Ontogenetic shifts from invertivory to piscivory were observed for
   whiting in both zones and for hake and cod in the deep zone. An
   unexpected shift from the pelagic to the benthic trophic pathway was
   observed from small to large haddock in the deep zone. Taking into
   account the descriptions of diets made in adjacent ecosystems throughout
   the year, the four species show trophic plasticity towards one of the
   trophic pathways or the other. Differences between the shallow and deep
   zones were related to benthic and pelagic prey characteristics, which
   themselves are driven by the sedimentary and hydrological context,
   especially thermal stratification.",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Day, L (Corresponding Author), IFREMER, Ctr Nantes, Rue Ile dYeu,BP 21105, F-44311 Nantes 03, France.

Article,Roger A. Burke and Ken M. Fritz and Brent R. Johnson and Rachel Price,"Mountaintop removal coal mining impacts on structural and functional
   indicators in Central Appalachian streams",FRONTIERS IN WATER,2023,4,NA,NA,JAN 19,"Mountaintop removal coal mining (MTR) has been a major source of
   landscape change in the Central Appalachians of the United States (US).
   Changes in stream hydrology, channel geomorphology and water quality
   caused by MTR coal mining can lead to severe impairment of stream
   ecological integrity. The objective of the Clean Water Act (CWA) is to
   restore and maintain the ecological integrity of the Nation's waters.
   Sensitive, readily measured indicators of ecosystem structure and
   function are needed for the assessment of stream ecological integrity.
   Most CWA assessments rely on structural indicators; inclusion of
   functional indicators could make these assessments more holistic and
   effective. The goals of this study were: (1) test the efficacy of
   selected carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling and microbial structural
   and functional indicators for assessing MTR coal mining impacts on
   streams; (2) determine whether indicators respond to impacts in a
   predictable manner; and (3) determine if functional indicators are less
   likely to change than are structural indicators in response to stressors
   associated with MTR coal mining. The structural indicators are water
   quality and sediment organic matter concentrations, and the functional
   indicators relate to microbial activity and biofilm production. Seasonal
   measurements were conducted over the course of a year in streams
   draining small MTR-impacted and forested watersheds in the Twentymile
   Creek watershed of West Virginia (WV). Five of the eight structural
   parameters measured had significant responses, with all means greater in
   the MTR-impacted streams than in the forested streams. These responses
   resulted from changes in source or augmentation of the original source
   of the C and N structural parameters because of MTR coal mining. Nitrate
   concentration and the stable carbon isotopic ratio of dissolved
   inorganic carbon were the most effective indicators evaluated in this
   study. Only three of the fourteen functional indicators measured had
   significant responses to MTR coal mining, with all means greater in the
   forested streams than in the MTR-impacted streams. These results suggest
   that stressors associated with MTR coal mining caused reduction in some
   aspects of microbial cycling, but resource subsidies may have
   counterbalanced some of the inhibition leading to no observable change
   in most of the functional indicators. The detritus base, which is
   thought to confer functional stability, was likely sustained in the
   MTR-impacted streams by channel storage and/or leaf litter inputs from
   their largely intact riparian zones. Overall, our results largely
   support the hypothesis that certain functional processes are more
   resistant to stress induced change than structural properties but also
   suggest the difficulty of identifying suitable functional indicators for
   ecological integrity assessment.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Burke, RA (Corresponding Author), US EPA, Ctr Environm Measurement \& Modeling CEMM, Athens, GA 30605 USA.

   Dareh, Bestansur and Jarmo",JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS,2023,49,NA,NA,JUN,"The transition from hunter gathering to farming is one of the most
   important episodes in the history of humankind. Considerable evidence
   indicates that this shift was a slow, complex, highly localized process,
   which took place in multiple places in Southwest Asia independently,
   from around 9500 BC. Caprines were arguably the first domesticated
   livestock, brought under human control during a process that began in
   the 9th millennium BC in a region extending from south-eastern Turkey to
   north-western Iran. In this research we integrate zooarchaeological
   analysis with stable isotopic data of faunal remains from three key
   Early Neolithic sites in the Eastern Fertile Crescent: Ganj Dareh (ca.
   8000 BC), Bestansur (ca. 7800-7000 BC) and Jarmo (ca. 7000-5000
   BC).While some form of goat management seemed to have been practiced at
   Bestansur, based on spherulites, dung and shed deciduous teeth, no
   evidence has been found for winter foddering or transhumance practices.
   At Ganj Dareh goat were managed, and might have been foddered during the
   winter or vertical transhumance might have taken place. At Pottery
   Neolithic Jarmo both sheep and goat were managed and they were possibly
   brought to higher elevations during the summer months or foddered during
   winter. This research has supported the idea that already during early
   stages of goat management, humans kept a high degree of control over the

   microalgae: a test for potential use of allochthonous organic matter",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,2009,386,NA,107-113,NA,"We experimentally reduced benthic microalgae using opaque rubber canopy
   covers and observed dietary responses of Corophium spinicorne (amphipod)
   and Macoma balthica (bivalve) based on delta C-13 and delta N-15
   measurements in 2 estuarine tidal flats. Each of the tidal flats (MA and
   TE) was predominated by marine- or terrestrial-origin organic matter
   (OM), respectively. We hypothesised that the reduction of benthic
   microalgae correspondingly decreases the proportion of macrobenthos diet
   attributable to benthic microalgae, and enhances their assimilation of
   allochthonous OM. Our canopy treatment reduced chlorophyll a in the
   surface sediment by 35 to 40\%. While delta C-13 and delta N-15 of M
   balthica were not affected by the canopy treatment, the signatures of C.
   spinicorne were significantly altered at both sites. In MA, the canopy
   treatment reduced the nutritional dependence of C. spinicorne on benthic
   microalgae and maintained their substantial dependence on the
   marine-origin OM predominating in the sediment. On the contrary, in TE,
   the canopy treatment enhanced the nutritional dependence of C.
   spinicorne on benthic microalgae and lowered their dependence on the
   terrestrial-origin OM predominating in the sediment. The canopy
   treatment significantly changed the C:N and delta N-15 of the sediment
   OM in TE. This suggests that benthic microalgae affected biogeochemical
   processes and the chemical properties of OM in the sediment subsurface.
   Benthic microalgae may have indirectly controlled nutritional
   utilisation of terrestrial-origin OM in the sediment by macrobenthos.
   Overall, the dietary compositions of macrobenthos did not always vary in

   experiment in the coastal upwelling off Callao Bay (Peru)",BIOGEOSCIENCES,2023,20,5,945-969,MAR 9,"The Humboldt Current Upwelling System (HCS) is the most productive
   eastern boundary upwelling system (EBUS) in terms of fishery yield on
   the planet. EBUSs are considered hotspots of climate change with
   predicted expansion of mesopelagic oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) and
   related changes in the frequency and intensity of upwelling of
   nutrient-rich, low-oxygen deep water. To increase our mechanistic
   understanding of how upwelling impacts plankton communities and trophic
   links, we investigated mesozooplankton community succession and gut
   fluorescence, fatty acid and elemental compositions (C, N, O, P), and
   stable isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15) ratios of dominant
   mesozooplankton and microzooplankton representatives in a mesocosm setup
   off Callao (Peru) after simulated upwelling with OMZ water from two
   different locations and different N:P signatures (moderate and extreme
   treatments). An oxycline between 5 and 15 m with hypoxic conditions (<
   50 mu mol L-1) below similar to 10 m persisted in the mesocosms
   throughout the experiment. No treatment effects were determined for the
   measured parameters, but differences in nutrient concentrations
   established through OMZ water additions were only minor. Copepods and
   polychaete larvae dominated in terms of abundance and biomass.
   Development and reproduction of the dominant copepod genera Paracalanus
   sp., Hemicyclops sp., Acartia sp., and Oncaea sp. were hindered as
   evident from accumulation of adult copepodids but largely missing
   nauplii. Failed hatching of nauplii in the hypoxic bottom layer of the
   mesocosms and poor nutritional condition of copepods suggested from very
   low gut fluorescence and fatty acid compositions most likely explain the
   retarded copepod development. Correlation analysis revealed no
   particular trophic relations between dominant copepods and phytoplankton
   groups. Possibly, particulate organic matter with a relatively high C:N
   ratio was a major diet of copepods. C:N ratios of copepods and
   polychaetes ranged 4.8-5.8 and 4.2-4.3, respectively. delta N-15 was
   comparatively high (similar to 13 parts per thousand -17 parts per
   thousand), potentially because the injected OMZ source water was
   enriched in delta 15N as a result of anoxic conditions. Elemental ratios
   of dinoflagellates deviated strongly from the Redfield ratio. We
   conclude that opportunistic feeding of copepods may have played an
   important role in the pelagic food web. Overall, projected changes in
   the frequency and intensity of upwelling hypoxic waters may make a huge
   difference for copepod reproduction and may be further enhanced by
   varying N:P ratios of upwelled OMZ water masses.",COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",Article,English,"Lischka, S (Corresponding Author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Biol Oceanog, Kiel, Germany.
