"Sardenne, Fany and Simard, Manon and Robinson, Shawn M C and McKindsey, Christopher W",2020,Consumption of organic wastes from coastal salmon aquaculture by wild decapods.,Science of the total environment,"Rock crab Cancer irroratus and American lobster Homarus americanus are important commercial species in coastal areas where intensive salmon aquaculture occurs in eastern Canada. Such aquaculture releases organic wastes, especially feed waste (i.e. food pellets made in part from terrestrial feed ingredients). Terrestrial compounds from feed wastes were used to trace their consumption by the two decapods in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Both species were collected in farms and reference sites and their fatty acid profiles evaluated. Individuals in close proximity to salmon farms were found to consume waste feed (high proportions of 18:1n-9 and 18:2n-6 and low proportions of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3). This consumption is associated with a reduction in diet diversity and a trend of increased lipid content in rock crab, suggesting that this species is more receptive to the waste feed than the American lobster, which did not show evidence of diet diversity loss and of increased lipid content. Fatty acid profiles from rock crab ovaries were also affected by the diet shift toward waste feed (low proportion of long-chain essential fatty acids), suggesting a potential influence on crab reproductive success. However, this remains to be assessed. Resulting effects of diet shifts on the ecosystem (e.g. reduction in the consumption of primary consumers and change of fatty acids transferred to predatory fish or gulls through decapods) should be evaluated to assess the spatial and temporal scales of the salmon aquaculture footprint. If the assessment reveals a strong footprint, measures to reduce wastes could be considered (e.g. pellets with greater buoyancy or with different recipe).",S0048-9697(19)34855-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134863 [doi],Cancer irroratus and Fatty acids and Feeding niche and Homarus americanus and Lipid-correction model and Stable isotopes,Aquatic,Marine,"Bay of Fundy, Canada",Spatial,Rock crabs,Density,Aquaculture,Aquaculture,% terrestrially derived carbon & Fatty Acid Profile,Hepatopancreas and muscle,Lipids extracted ,NA,Aquatculture pellets,Increase,"The contribution of food wastes from salmon aquaculture to decapod diets was assessed in the Bay of Fundy, eastern Canada, using ecological tracers (fatty acids and stable isotopes) from various tissues. Rock crabs and American lobsters caught directly below salmon farms had different FA profiles compared to individuals caught in references sites 2 km away. The difference was mainly driven by the presence of terrestrial FAs from salmon feed. Associated with this shift, crab, but not lobster, diet diversity was lower beneath farms.

Threadfin shad competitively displaced other planktivorous fish in the lake, such as inland silversides, young-of-year (YOY) largemouth bass, and YOY bluegill, by reducing zooplankton abundance. As a result, all three species shifted from a diet that was dominated by zooplankton to one that was almost entirely zoobenthos. Stable carbon isotopes corroborated this pattern with each species becoming enriched in delta13C, which is elevated in benthic vs. pelagic organisms. Concomitant with these changes, Hg concentrations increased by approximately 50% in all three species. In contrast, obligate benthivores such as prickly sculpin showed no relationship between diet or delta13C and the presence of threadfin shad, suggesting that effects of the shad were not strongly linked to the benthic fish community. There were also no changes in Hg concentrations of prickly sculpin. The temporary extirpation of threadfin shad from the lake resulted in zooplankton densities, foraging patterns, isotope ratios, and Hg concentrations in pelagic fishes returning to pre-shad values. These results indicate that even transient perturbations of the structure of freshwater food webs can result in significant alterations in the bioaccumulation of Hg and that food webs in lakes can be highly resilient.",10.1890/06-1415.1 [doi],NA,Aquatic,Lake,"Clear Lake, California",Temporal,Largemouth bass,Accessibility,Biological invasion,Species invasion,% pelagic derived carbon,muscle,NA,NA,zooplankton and benthic invertebrates,Decrease,"Largemouth bass decreased their pelagic reliance in the presence of invasive shad, and simultaneously increase their benthic reliance. Largemouth bass are primarily a benthic/littoral consumer and the top predator in the system (determined by FL). Although the authors did not use baselines in their analysis, they did analyze stomach contents AND argue for why the results do not reflect a baseline shift. Further support of this interpretation comes from the prickly sculpin, an obligate benthic feeder (Moyle 2002). Neither the stomach contents nor their _13C signatures differed in relation to shad abundance, indicating that isotopic changes seen in silversides and bass likely resulted from an increase in benthic reliance and not a baseline shift in the lake's isotopic values at the primary producer level.",Table 2;  Fig. 7,,0.007,,

Invaded lakes had lower littoral prey-fish diversity and abundance than uninvaded reference lakes. Consistent with this difference, lake trout from invaded lakes had more negative delta(13)C values (-29.2 parts per thousand versus -27.4 parts per thousand) and reduced trophic positions (3.3 versus 3.9) than those from reference lakes, indicating differences in food-web structure, Furthermore, a comparison of the pre- and post-invasion food webs of two recently invaded lakes showed that invasion was followed by substantial declines in littoral prey-fish abundance and the trophic position of lake trout, reflecting a shift in the diet of lake trout towards zooplankton and reduced dependence on littoral fish.

Within the Lake Michigan food web, invasive dreissenid mussels have caused rapid changes to food web structure and potentially altered the channels through which consumers acquire energy. We used stable C and N isotopes to determine how Lake Michigan food web structure has changed in the past decade, coincident with the expansion of dreissenid mussels, decreased pelagic phytoplankton production, and increased nearshore benthic algal production. Fish and invertebrate samples collected from sites around Lake Michigan were analyzed to determine taxa-specific 13C:12C (delta13C) and 15N:14N (delta15N) ratios. Sampling took place during two distinct periods, 2002-2003 and 2010-2012, that spanned the period of dreissenid expansion, and included nearshore, pelagic and profundal fish and invertebrate taxa. The magnitude and direction of the delta13C shift indicated significantly greater reliance upon nearshore benthic energy sources among nearly all fish taxa as well as profundal invertebrates following dreissenid expansion. Although the mechanisms underlying this delta13C shift likely varied among species, possible causes include the transport of benthic algal production to offshore waters and increased feeding on nearshore prey items by pelagic and profundal species. delta15N shifts were more variable and of smaller magnitude across taxa, although declines in delta15N among some pelagic fishes suggest a shift to alternative prey resources. Lake Michigan fishes and invertebrates appear to have responded to dreissenid-induced changes in nutrient and energy pathways by switching from pelagic to alternative nearshore energy subsidies. Although large shifts in energy allocation (i.e., pelagic to nearshore benthic) resulting from invasive species appear to affect total production at upper trophic levels, changes in trophic structure and utilization of novel energy pathways may help to stabilize food webs following species invasions.",10.1890/13-0329.1 [doi],NA,Aquatic,Lake,Lake Michigan,Temporal,Fish community,Density,Biological invasion,Species invasion,% benthic derived carbon,muscle,Post lipid correction,NA,"Neashore diatoms (cladophora and periphyton), native mussels, and zooplankton",Decrease,"Circular statistics reveal that the mean angle of change in the _13C and _15N biplot from 2002Ð2003 to 2010Ð2012 was _0.218 ± 0.86 radians (±SD) for the pelagic/profundal fish community.

These impacts are interrelated with changes in food web architecture. However, the reorganization or robustness of food webs in the face of invasion is a phenomenon poorly considered in ecology and conservation practices. In this article, we analyze the effects of the invasion of the American bullfrog, Lithobates catesbeianus, on the structure and function of invaded food webs. Specifically, we analyzed the integration of energetic channels by top predators, the relative use of alternative energetic paths by different functional groups and its dependence on body size among invaded and uninvaded communities in Uruguay, South America. The integration of energetic paths at high trophic positions by large body sized consumers was a pervasive feature of food webs among all studied ponds, in spite of turnover in top predator identity and large changes in community composition. Bullfrog post-metamorphs presented high trophic positions, integrating the primary producers and detritus paths, acting as apex predators in invaded food webs. The bullfrog tadpoles presented intermediate positions and were associated with the detritivorous pathway. On the other hand, the relative importance of the primary producers and detritus as carbon sources assimilated into the biomass of fish and invertebrates was altered in invaded systems. The robustness in the integration pattern of energy channels is congruent with its proposed central role in the stability of food webs. These results advance the understanding of the effect of invasions on key structural features of food webs, notably underrepresented in the invasion literature.",10.1007/s10530-022-02956-7,"Aquatic community; Trophic path; Top predator; Food web stability;

Fish at the invaded pond significantly increased their allochthonous supported biomass along their body size range. Fish that coexisted with bullfrogs presented a proportion of 50% allochthonous supported biomass in the smallest sizes and a proportion of 75% in the largest sizes, while fish in the control site (uninvaded pond) presented a contribution from allochthonous source of approximately 30%, independently of individual body size. In the selected model, the interaction between body size and bullfrog presence was statistically significant.

"Wood, Kevin A and Hayes, Richard B and England, Judy and Grey, Jonathan",2017,Invasive crayfish impacts on native fish diet and growth vary with fish life stage.,Aquatic sciences,"Assessing the impacts of invasive organisms is a major challenge in ecology. Some widespread invasive species such as crayfish are potential competitors and reciprocal predators of ecologically and recreationally important native fish species. Here, we examine the effects of signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) on the growth, diet, and trophic position of the chub (Squalius cephalus) in four rivers in Britain. Growth rates of 0+ chub were typically lower in sympatric populations with signal crayfish compared with allopatric populations, and this effect could be traced through to 2+ chub in one river. However, growth rates of older chub (5+ to 6+) were typically higher in the presence of crayfish. Sympatry with crayfish resulted in lower chub length-at-age and mass-at-age in half of the rivers sampled, with no change detected in the other rivers. Stable isotope analyses (Î´(13)C and Î´(15)N) revealed that both chub and crayfish were omnivorous, feeding at multiple trophic levels and occupying similar trophic positions. We found some evidence that chub trophic position was greater at invaded sites on one river, with no difference detected on a second river. Mixing models suggested crayfish were important food items for both small and large chub at invaded sites. This study provides evidence that invasive species can have both positive and negative effects on different life stages of a native species, with the net impact likely to depend on responses at the population level.",10.1007/s00027-016-0483-2,Chub Squalius cephalus and Competition and Diet shift and Invasive species and Scalimetry and Signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus and Stable isotopes,Aquatic,River,Britain,Spatial,Common chub (Squalius cephalus),Density,Biological invasion,Species Introduction,source contribution to diet,scale and muscle,NA,"D15N (2.3ä), D13C (2.1ä) ","crayfish, macrophytes, detritus, terrestrial

We combined information about pre- and postdreissenid abundance, biomass, and secondary production of the littoral benthos with results of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of archival (predreissenid) and recent (postdreissenid) samples of all common benthic taxa. This approach enabled us to determine the importance of benthic and sestonic carbon to the littoral food web before, and more than a decade after dreissenid establishment. Long term dreissenid presence was associated with a 32-fold increase in abundance, 6-fold increase in biomass, and 14-fold increase in secondary production of the littoral benthos. Dreissenids comprised a large portion of the post-invasion benthos, making up 13, 38, and 56% of total abundance, biomass, and secondary production, respectively. The predreissenid food web was supported primarily by benthic primary production, while sestonic material was relatively more important to the postdreissenid food web. The absolute importance of both sestonic material and benthic primary production to the littoral benthos increased considerably following dreissenid establishment. Our results show drastic alterations to food web structure and suggest that dreissenid mussels redirect energy and material from the water column to the littoral benthos both through biodeposition of sestonic material as well as stimulation of benthic primary production.",10.1371/journal.pone.0051249,NA,Aquatic,Lake,"Ontario, Canada",Temporal,Northern clearwater crayfish (Orconectes propinquus),Density,Biological invasion,Species Introduction,% sestonic carbon ,dorsal abdominal muscle,NA,NA,hydropsychids-snails & seston-periphyton,Increase,"Contributions of sestonic material and benthic primary production to the food web shifted following dreissenid establishment.

",2009,Resource switching in fish following a major food web disruption,Ecosystem ecology,"Dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis) have re-engineered Great Lakes ecosystems since their introduction in the late 1980s. Dreissenids can have major indirect impacts on profundal habitats by redirecting nutrients and energy away from pelagic production (which supplies profundal production) and depositing nutrients and energy in the nearshore zones that they occupy. However, strong empirical evidence for the effects of this redirection of resources on fish populations is currently lacking. Here, we report significant shifts in isotopic signatures, depth distribution and diets of a coldwater profundal fish population that are all consistent with a greater reliance on nearshore resources after the establishment of dreissenid mussels in South Bay, Lake Huron. Isotopic signatures of scales collected from 5-year-old lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) demonstrated remarkable stability over the 50-year period prior to the establishment of dreissenids (1947Ð1997) and a sudden and significant change in isotopic signatures (3ä enrichment in _13C and 1ä depletion in _15N) after their establishment (2001Ð2005). These dramatic shifts in isotopic signatures were accompanied by a coincident shift in the mean depth of capture of lake whitefish towards the nearshore. A comparison of previously unpublished pre-invasion diets of lake whitefish from South Bay with contemporary diets collected between 2002 and 2005 also indicate a greater reliance on nearshore prey after the invasion of dreissenid mussels. This study is the first to report changes in the carbon source available to lake whitefish associated with restructured benthic communities after the appearance of dreissenid mussels. Further, this study contributes to a growing body of work that demonstrates the ecological insights that can be gained through isotopic analysis of archived fish bony tissues in ecosystems that have experienced significant levels of disturbance.",10.1007/s00442-008-1271-z [doi],"Nearshore phosphorous shunt, Dreissenids, Biological invasion, Stable isotopes, Lake whiteWsh",Aquatic,Lake,"Lake Huron, Ontario",Temporal,Lake whitefish,Density,Biological invasion,Species Introduction,% pelagic derived carbon and stomach contents,scale,NA,3.4ä for _15N and 1ä for _13C,benthic inverts and zooplankton at different depths,Increase,"Lake whitefish diet data indicated a greater reliance on nearshore prey after the invasion of dreissenids than before.

The authors also categorized all benthic organisms collected at depths >30 m to be profundal and all other benthic organisms (excluding fish) to be nearshore. Based on averages over all months (weighted by the number of fish with full stomachs), profundal contributions to whitefish diets went from 71% in 1947 to only 30% in 2005, whereas littoral contributions increased from 23% in 1947 to 59% in 2005 (42% excluding non-native dreissenid mussels).

We sampled surface water and biota from 8 lakes in Quebec, Canada, spanning a range of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (2.9-8.4 mg/L); 4 lakes were inhabited by native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and the remaining lakes contained brook trout and a non-native fish, Allegheny pearl dace (Margariscus margarita). Periphyton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and fish were analyzed for: 1) stable carbon (Î´(13) C) and nitrogen (Î´(15) N) isotope ratios to delineate food webs, and 2) total Hg (THg) or MeHg. Compared with the brook trout from reference lakes, fish from invaded lakes had higher length-standardized THg concentrations as well as a narrower dietary range and elevated trophic level, inferred from unadjusted Î´(13) C and Î´(15) N values, respectively. The rate of Hg biomagnification was similar across invaded and reference lakes, implying little effect of the invasive fish on the trophic transfer of MeHg. Despite differences in food web structure due to pearl dace invasion, DOC was the strongest predictor of brook trout THg levels for all lakes, suggesting that underlying environmental factors exerted a stronger influence on brook trout THg concentrations than the presence of a non-native forage fish.

We analysed the stomach contents and stable isotope values (delta N-15 and delta C-13) in muscle and liver tissues of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) to determine whether these native salmonids utilise marine-derived nutrients and energy provided by pink salmon eggs and carcasses in the subarctic river system Vesterelva, northern Norway. Although egg foraging and assimilation of marine-derived nutrients in fish body tissues were found to be minor at the population level, a few juvenile salmon and trout had recently eaten large quantities of pink salmon eggs.

   AMERICA","Food webs unfold across a mosaic of micro and macro habitats, with each habitat coupled by mobile consumers that behave in response to local environmental conditions. Despite this fundamental characteristic of nature, research on how climate change will affect whole ecosystems has overlooked (i) that climate warming will generally affect habitats differently and (ii) that mobile consumers may respond to this differential change in a manner that may fundamentally alter the energy pathways that sustain ecosystems. This reasoning suggests a powerful, but largely unexplored, avenue for studying the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning. Here, we use lake ecosystems to show that predictable behavioral adjustments to local temperature differentials govern a fundamental structural shift across 54 food webs. Data show that the trophic pathways from basal resources to a cold-adapted predator shift toward greater reliance on a cold-water refuge habitat, and food chain length increases, as air temperatures rise. Notably, cold-adapted predator behavior may substantially drive this decoupling effect across the climatic range in our study independent of warmer-adapted species responses (for example, changes in near-shore species abundance and predator absence). Such modifications reflect a flexible food web architecture that requires more attention from climate change research. The trophic pathway restructuring documented here is expected to alter biomass accumulation, through the regulation of energy fluxes to predators, and thus potentially threatens ecosystem sustainability in times of rapid environmental change.",10.1073/pnas.1319618111,"species interactions; thermoregulation; trophic structure; habitat

We applied stable isotope analysis and geometric morphometrics to estimate long-term resource and habitat utilization of perch. Habitat coupling, the ability to exploit littoral and pelagic resources, strongly decreased with increasing DOC concentrations due to a shift toward feeding predominantly on pelagic resources. Simultaneously, resource use and body morphology became increasingly alike for littoral and pelagic perch populations with increasing DOC, suggesting more intense competition in lakes with high DOC. Eye size of perch increased with increasing DOC concentrations, likely as a result of deteriorating visual conditions, suggesting a sensory response to environmental change. Increasing input of DOC to aquatic ecosystems is a common result of environmental change and might affect top predator populations in multiple and complex ways.",10.1007/s10021-016-9978-x,"allochthony; brownification; food web coupling; visibility; foraging;

   predator",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,"Rapid anthropogenic environmental change is expected to impact a host of ecological parameters in Southern Ocean ecosystems. Of critical concern are the consequences of these changes on the range of species that show fidelity to migratory destinations, as philopatry is hypothesized to help or hinder adaptation to climate change depending on the circumstances. Many baleen whales show philopatry to feeding grounds and are also capital breeders that meet migratory and reproductive costs through seasonal energy intake. Southern right whales (Eubalaena australis, SRWs) are capital breeders that have a strong relationship between reproductive output and foraging success. The population dynamics of South Africa's population of SRWs are characterized by two distinct periods: the 1990s, a period of high calving rates; and the late 2010s, a period associated with lowered calving rates. Here we use analyses of stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope values from SRW biopsy samples (n = 122) collected during these two distinct periods to investigate foraging ecology of the South African population of SRWs over a time period coincident with the demographic shift. We show that South African SRWs underwent a dramatic northward shift, and diversification, in foraging strategy from 1990s to 2010s. Bayesian mixing model results suggest that during the 1990s, South African SRWs foraged on prey isotopically similar to South Georgia/Islas Georgias del Sur krill. In contrast, in the 2010s, South African SRWs foraged on prey isotopically consistent with the waters of the Subtropical Convergence, Polar Front and Marion Island. We hypothesize that this shift represents a response to changes in preferred habitat or prey, for example, the decrease in abundance and southward range contraction of Antarctic krill. By linking reproductive decline to changing foraging strategies for the first time in SRWs, we show that altering foraging strategies may not be sufficient to adapt to a changing ocean.",10.1111/gcb.15465,"Bayesian mixing model; cetacean; climate change; foraging ecology;

Here, we use an unparalleled 11-y acoustic telemetry, stable isotope, and mark-recapture dataset to test if a population of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), a cold-water stenotherm, adjusted its use of habitat and energy sources in response to annual variations in lake temperatures during the open-water season and how these changes translated to the growth and condition of individual fish. We found that climate influenced access to littoral regions in spring (data from telemetry), which in turn influenced energy acquisition (data from isotopes), and growth (mark-recapture data). In more stressful years, those with shorter springs and longer summers, lake trout had reduced access to littoral habitat and assimilated less littoral energy, resulting in reduced growth and condition. Annual variation in prey abundance influenced lake trout foraging tactics (i.e., the balance of the number and duration of forays) but not the overall time spent in littoral regions.

There is a distinct lack of research regarding their ecological response to climatic events in the Global South. This region is predicted to experience climatic events such as El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) more often and with greater severity with the potential to alter the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems significantly. From 2015 to 2016 South Africa experienced one of the most severe country-wide droughts as a result of a strong ENSO event. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of this supra-seasonal drought on the trophic structure of fish communities in a naturally saline shallow lake of a Ramsar wetland using stable isotope techniques. Fishes and potential basal sources were collected from the lake, during predrought conditions in 2010 and after severe drought (recovery phase; 2017). The Î´(13)C and Î´(15)N values of food web elements were determined and analysed using Bayesian mixing models and Bayesian Laymen metrics to establish the proportional contribution of C(3) and C(4) basal sources to the fish (consumer) diets, and examine the fish community in terms of isotopic niche and trophic structure, respectively. Fish consumers relied predominantly on C(3) basal sources in the predrought and shifted to greater reliance on C(4) basal sources, decreased isotopic niche space use and a reduction in trophic length in the recovery phase. Drought altered the type and abundance of the basal sources available by limiting sources to those that are more drought-tolerant, reducing the trophic pathways of the food web with no significant alterations in the fish community.

These range shifts are expected to change fish community structure and alter food-web dynamics in subarctic lakes. However, the impacts of invading species on native fish and invertebrate prey communities remain understudied. The trophic ecology of invasive species determines the likelihood of direct resource competition with native taxa. In Northern Europe, perch (Perca fluviatilis), a trophic generalist, and ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), a benthic specialist, are expanding their distribution ranges northwards, colonising lakes inhabited by a native generalist, whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus). We predicted that increased fish diversity and density would deplete the invertebrate community and increase resource competition between native and invasive species. To assess the degree of resource competition between native and invasive species, we compared (i) fish and invertebrate community structure; (ii) diet and stable carbon and nitrogen ratios of whitefish, ruffe and perch and (iii) growth, condition and relative population size of whitefish in two non-invaded lakes with two lakes containing one and two lakes containing both invasive species. Each lake was sampled on a single occasion between August and September. Benthic macroinvertebrate density and community structure were unaffected by increased consumer diversity, while top-down control of pelagic zooplankton density and size was evident in lakes with increased fish diversity. Differences in diet and stable isotope ratios were evident between all whitefish populations, although these were not directly related to the presence of invasive species. Specialised adaptations of invasive species may confer a competitive advantage in invaded lakes; ruffe dominated the profundal niche, while perch displayed an ontogenetic shift to piscivory, reducing niche overlap with native whitefish. Growth rate and population density of whitefish were largely independent of fish community structure and were governed by local variations in lake productivity. However, there was a sign of lowered condition of whitefish in invaded systems. Shallow and more productive lakes with higher food availability supported populations of native and invasive species. Our findings indicate that trophic specialisations of invasive species play a key role in determining their impacts on the systems they invade. This study focussed on early stages of invasion, and the outcome of species interactions may change following the establishment of new species. In addition, these impacts will not be uniform across the invaded landscape as lake-specific variations in morphometry and resource availability will alter the competitive balance between native and invasive species.",10.1111/fwb.12123,"climate change; competition; fish; food webs; invasive species;

Anadromous Arctic Char, Salvelinus alpinus (Linnaeus, 1758), feed intensively at sea during summer. In Cumberland Sound, Nunavut, Canada, there has been a recent increased availability of a forage fish, Capelin. To investigate changes over time in Arctic Char foraging, we assessed Arctic Char trophic niche from 2002 to 2011 using stomach content analysis and stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of muscle tissue from two river/lake systems, Isuituq and Kipisa. We also compared population characteristics by calculating Fulton's condition factor (K) and by fitting von Bertalanffy growth curves with length-at-age data. Results revealed Capelin were newly present in the diets of Arctic Char in 2011, describing a shift from a primarily invertebrate-based to a fish-based diet. No trend in delta N-15 over time suggests that the trophic level of Arctic Char has not changed; however, the delta C-13 for both systems converged in 2011 on a value suggestive of feeding on Capelin. Growth curves and length-at-age analyses suggest that foraging on Capelin may have increased individual growth.

This change in isotopic composition is suggestive of increased reliance on previously unavailable capelin in the region.  While the authors did not have the ability to use baselines in the isotopic analysis, they do cite a study that that evaluates the feeding ecology of marine predators in the region during their study period of suggest that baselines have not shifted over time. They also use stomach content analysis to supplement their isotopic analysis and find similar results. In 2002, 2003, and 2004, amphipod crustaceans made up the highest proportion of the weight of Arctic Char diets from both Kipisa and Isuituq, and were the dominant prey item according to all three importance indices. In 2011, Capelin were the dominant prey item for Arctic Char from Kipisa according to the IRI (relative importance), whereas amphipods were still relatively important in the diets of Isuituq Arctic Char. The addtional resource incorporated into the diet of Arctic Char suggests increase coupling of ice-associated habitats (where capelin inhabit) with warming, as amphipods (the other prevelant resource in char diets) occupy deeper basin waters in the Arctic.

We examined this question by comparing the blubber fatty acid (FA) composition and stable carbon isotope ratios of individual FA (Î´Â¹Â³CFA) of adult ringed seals (Pusa hispida), bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus), spotted seals (Phoca largha), and ribbon seals (Histriophoca fasciata), collectively known as ""ice seals,"" sampled during an anomalously warm, low sea ice period in 2002-2005 in the Bering Sea and a subsequent cold, high sea ice period in 2007-2010. Î´Â¹Â³C(FA) values, used to estimate the contribution to seals of carbon derived from sea ice algae (sympagic production) relative to that derived from water column phytoplankton (pelagic production), indicated that during the cold period, sympagic production accounted for 62-80% of the FA in the blubber of bearded seals, 51-62% in spotted seals, and 21-60% in ringed seals. Moreover, the Î´Â¹Â³CFA values of bearded seals indicated a greater incorporation of sympagic FAs during the cold period than the warm period. This result provides the first empirical evidence of an ecosystem-scale effect of a putative change in sympagic production in the Western Arctic. The FA composition of ice seals showed clear evidence of resource partitioning among ringed, bearded, and spotted seals, and little niche separation between spotted and ribbon seals, which is consistent with previous studies. Despite interannual variability, the FA composition of ringed and bearded seals showed little evidence of differences in diet between the warm and cold periods. The findings that sympagic production contributes significantly to food webs supporting ice seals, and that the contribution apparently is less in warm years with low sea ice, raise an important concern: Will the projected warming and continuing loss of seasonal sea ice in the Arctic, and the associated decline of organic matter input from sympagic production, be compensated for by pelagic production to satisfy both pelagic and benthic carbon and energy needs?",10.1890/14-2421 [doi],NA,Aquatic,Marine,Bering-Chukchi continental shelf ,Temporal,Ice seals,Density,Climate change,Sea-ice loss,% sympagic derived carbon (_13CFA),blubber,Lipids extracted,NA (FAs used),"organic matter from sea

However, multiple complementary analytical tools to examine variation in carbon source use and trophic dynamics in the diet of ringed seals have not yet been applied across their latitudinal range in the Arctic. We conducted stable isotope analysis (delta 13C and delta 15N) and measured highly branched isoprenoid diatom lipid biomarkers of ringed seals from the low, intermediate, and high Arctic (from 61.1 degrees N to 77.5 degrees N) to investigate spatial variation in their carbon source use and trophic position in relation to sea-ice dynamics.

Ringed seal trophic position increased from the low (3.78 +/- 0.02) to high (4.76 +/- 0.03) Arctic, suggesting increased fish consumption or a different trophic structure coinciding with the latitudinal change in carbon source. Ringed seals demonstrated a clear shift from low to high Arctic in the relative contribution of phytoplanktonic vs sympagic primary production. These patterns are likely linked to the vastly different icescapes in these environments and demonstrate that shifts in primary producer composition and Arctic food webs can be identified in ringed seal diets.

The arctic fox population in Iceland has increased steadily over a period of 30 years, an increase that has been attributed to an overall increase in food abundance. We hypothesized that increasing populations of geese or seabirds were driving this growth. We analyzed stable isotopes in a long-term series of collagen samples to determine the role of these different resources. The isotopic signatures of arctic foxes differed consistently between coastal and inland habitats. While Î´(15)N displayed a non-linear change over time with a slight increase in the first part of the period followed by a decline in both habitats, Î´(13)C was stable. Stable isotope mixing models suggested that marine resources and rock ptarmigan were the most important dietary sources, with marine resources dominating in coastal habitats and rock ptarmigan being more important inland. Our results suggest that seabirds may have been driving the arctic fox population increase. The rapidly increasing populations of breeding geese seem to have played a minor role in arctic fox population growth, as rock ptarmigan was the most important terrestrial resource despite a considerable decrease in their abundance during recent decades. This study shows that a long-term population trend in a generalist predator may have occurred without a pronounced change in main dietary resources, despite ongoing structural changes in the food web, where one species of herbivorous birds increased and another decreased.",10.1007/s00442-019-04580-0 [pii] and 10.1007/s00442-019-04580-0 [doi],Diet and Iceland and Population increase and Stable isotope analysis and Vulpes lagopus,Terrestrial ,Arctic,Iceland,Spatiotemporal,Arctic fox,NA,Climate change,Prey abundance due to climactic conditions,% terrestrially derived carbon,muscle and fur,Ehrich et al.

"Gutierrez-Fonseca, Pablo E and Pringle, Catherine M and Ramirez, Alonso and Gomez, JesÃºs E and Garcia, Pavel",2024,Hurricane disturbance drives trophic changes in neotropical mountain stream food webs.,Ecology,"Food webs are complex ecological networks that reveal species interactions and energy flow in ecosystems. Prevailing ecological knowledge on forested streams suggests that their food webs are based on allochthonous carbon, driven by a constant supply of organic matter from adjacent vegetation and limited primary production due to low light conditions. Extreme climatic disturbances can disrupt these natural ecosystem dynamics by altering resource availability, which leads to changes in food web structure and functioning. Here, we quantify the response of stream food webs to two major hurricanes (Irma and MarÃ­a, Category 5 and 4, respectively) that struck Puerto Rico in September 2017. Within two tropical forested streams (first and second order), we collected ecosystem and food web data 6 months prior to the hurricanes and 2, 9, and 18 months afterward. We assessed the structural (e.g., canopy) and hydrological (e.g., discharge) characteristics of the ecosystem and monitored changes in basal resources (i.e., algae, biofilm, and leaf litter), consumers (e.g., aquatic invertebrates, riparian consumers), and applied Layman's community-wide metrics using the isotopic composition of (13) C and (15) N. Continuous stream discharge measurements indicated that the hurricanes did not cause an extreme hydrological event. However, the sixfold increase in canopy openness and associated changes in litter input appeared to trigger an increase in primary production. These food webs were primarily based on terrestrially derived carbon before the hurricanes, but most taxa (including Atya and Xiphocaris shrimp, the consumers with highest biomass) shifted their food source to autochthonous carbon within 2 months of the hurricanes. We also found evidence that the hurricanes dramatically altered the structure of the food web, resulting in shorter (i.e., smaller food-chain length), narrower (i.e., lower diversity of carbon sources) food webs, as well as increased trophic species packing. This study demonstrates how hurricane disturbance can alter stream food webs, changing the trophic base from allochthonous to autochthonous resources via changes in the physical environment (i.e., canopy defoliation). As hurricanes become more frequent and severe due to climate change, our findings greatly contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain forested stream trophic interactions amidst global change.",10.1002/ecy.4202 [doi],Bayesian mixing model and disturbances and food webs and hurricanes and neotropical streams and stable isotopes,Terrestrial ,Riparian,Puerto Rico,Temporal,Lizards (Anolis evermanni) & spiders,NA,Climate change,Hurricanes,% allochthonous derived carbon,Not indicated,NA,mean = 0.39 and SD = 1.14 for __13C and mean = 3.4 and SD = 0.99 for __15N,leaf litter and biofilm ,No change,"Before the intense hurricanes in Puerto Rico, the allochthonous carbon contribution ranged from 0.72 in Prieta A (Libellulidae) to 0.81 in Prieta B (A. evermanni).

These results are consistent with the changes in the length distribution of demersal fish species resulting from fishing and suggest that Franciscana dolphin has been the most benefited species of the three marine mammal species considered because of its intermediate mouth gape.

Moreover, we used a Bayesian mixing model to study diet composition and investigated potential dietary changes over the last two decades in this population. For this, we compared isotope signatures in samples of stranded dolphins obtained during two epizootic events occurring in 1990 and 2007-2008. Mean Î´(13)C values for females and males were not significantly different, but age-related variation indicated Î´(13)C enrichment in both sexes, suggesting that females and males most likely fed in the same general areas, increasing their consumption of benthic prey with age. Enrichment of Î´(15)N was only observed in females, suggesting a preference for larger or higher trophic level prey than males, which could reflect different nutritional requirements. Î´(13)C values showed no temporal variation, although the mean Î´(15)N signature decreased from 1990 to 2007-2008, which could indicate a dietary shift in the striped dolphin over the last two decades.

We measured the flux of emergent aquatic insects and the abundance of terrestrial invertebrate predators and birds along 10 streams across a forest-to-agriculture land-use gradient.

Small aquatic insects (Nematocera) were most abundant under agricultural land use, whereas larger bodied aquatic insects (Plecoptera and Trichoptera) were more associated with forest land use.

"Larson, Rachel N and Brown, Justin L and Karels, Tim and Riley, Seth P D",2020,Effects of urbanization on resource use and individual specialization in coyotes (Canis latrans) in southern California.,PloS one,"Urban environments are unique because fragments of natural or semi-natural habitat are embedded within a potentially permeable matrix of human-dominated areas, creating increased landscape and, potentially, habitat heterogeneity. In addition, urban areas can provide diet subsidies for wildlife species in the form of fruiting ornamental plants, trash, and domestic animals. Ecological opportunity in the forms of habitat and food heterogeneity are thought to be important mechanisms in maintaining individual specialization. Identifying which contexts, traits, and mechanisms determine the success or failure of individuals within an urban wildlife population could potentially provide predictions about which populations may succeed in human-dominated landscapes and which may experience local extinction. We used both scat and stable isotope analysis of whiskers to investigate the degree to which coyotes (Canis latrans) utilized anthropogenic subsidies and exhibited individual diet specialization across the urban-rural gradient in southern California. Land use surrounding scat and isotope sample locations was also evaluated to determine the effect of land cover on diet. Human food constituted a significant portion of urban coyote diet (22% of scats, 38% of diet estimated by stable isotope analysis). Domestic cats (Felis catus) and ornamental fruit and seeds were also important items in urban coyote diets. Consumption of anthropogenic items decreased with decreasing urbanization. In suburban areas, seasonality influenced the frequency of occurrence of anthropogenic subsidies with increased consumption in the dry season. The amount of altered open space (areas such as golf courses, cemeteries, and landscaped parks) nearby had a negative effect on the consumption of anthropogenic items in both urban and suburban areas. Contrary to our hypothesis, urban coyotes displayed reduced between-individual variation compared to suburban and rural coyotes. It is possible that the core urban areas of cities are so densely developed and subsidized that wildlife inhabiting these areas actually have reduced ecological opportunity. Suburban animals had the broadest isotopic niches and maintained similar individual specialization to rural coyotes. Wildlife in suburban areas still have access to relatively undisturbed natural areas while being able to take advantage of anthropogenic subsidies in neighboring residential areas.

Agricultural streams had compressed food webs with high trophic redundancy indicative of a shared resource pool for all consumers. In contrast, forested and buffered stream food webs showed larger trophic niche area due to greater utilization of detrital energy and higher variability in trophic position among invertebrates and fish. Circular statistics revealed fish communities shifted to lower trophic positions and increased dependence on periphyton production in agricultural streams.

Crayfish and insectivorous fish delta(13)C showed enrichment trends with deforestation, indicating isotopic divergence from CPOM, the most C-13-depleted basal resource, with reductions in catchment and riparian forest cover. Crayfish delta(13)C also exhibited enrichment with decreased instream CPOM standing crop. 4. A concentration-dependent mixing model was used to calculate the relative dependence of crayfish and fish on terrestrial versus aquatic basal resources. Results suggested that both allochthonous CPOM and autochthonous production were important basal resources. Consumer dependence on CPOM decreased with reductions in canopy cover. 5.

Human disturbance is rapidly altering the spatial and temporal niches of animals, but the impact of humans on resource consumption and partitioningÑarguably the most important niche axisÑis poorly understood. We assessed resource consumption and trophic niche partitioning as a function of human disturbance at the individual, population, and community levels using stable isotope analysis of 684 carnivores from seven communities in North America. We detected significant responses to human disturbance at all three levels of biological organization: individual carnivores consumed more human food subsidies in disturbed landscapes, leading to significant increases in trophic niche width and trophic niche overlap among species ranging from mesocarnivores to apex predators. Trophic niche partitioning is the primary mechanism regulating coexistence in many communities, and our results indicate that humans fundamentally alter resource niches and competitive interactions among terrestrial consumers. Among carnivores, niche overlap can trigger interspecific competition and intraguild predation, while the consumption of human foods significantly increases humanÐcarnivore conflict. Our results suggest that human disturbances, especially in the form of food subsidies, may threaten carnivores by increasing the probability of both interspecific competition and humanÐcarnivore conflict.

Land-use such as forestry activities in the Canadian Boreal region have increased in the last decades, raising concerns about their potential impact on aquatic ecosystems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of forest harvesting on trophic structure in eastern Canadian Boreal Shield lakes. We measured carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes values for aquatic primary producers, terrestrial detritus, benthic macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) over a three-year period in eight eastern Boreal Shield lakes. Four lakes were studied before, one and two years after forest harvesting (perturbed lakes) and compared with four undisturbed reference lakes (unperturbed lakes) sampled at the same time. Stable isotope mixing models showed leaf-litter to be the main food source for benthic primary consumers in both perturbed and unperturbed lakes, suggesting no logging impact on allochthonous subsidies to the littoral food web. Brook trout derived their food mainly from benthic predatory macroinvertebrates in unperturbed lakes. However, in perturbed lakes one year after harvesting, zooplankton appeared to be the main contributor to brook trout diet. This change in brook trout diet was mitigated two years after harvesting. Size-related diet shift were also observed for brook trout, indicating a diet shift related to size. Our study suggests that carbon from terrestrial habitat may be a significant contribution to the food web of oligotrophic Canadian Boreal Shield lakes. Forest harvesting did not have an impact on the diet of benthic primary consumers. On the other hand, brook trout diet composition was affected by logging with greater zooplankton contribution in perturbed lakes, possibly induced by darker-colored environment in these lakes one year after logging.",PONE-D-13-42036 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0096143 [doi],NA,Aquatic,Lake,Canada,Spatiotemporal,Fish,Density,Land conversion,Forestry,source contribution to diet,muscle,Post lipid correction,1% for 13C and 3.4% for 15N,"Terrestrial detritus (leaf litter, woody debris), macrophytes,

   Structure of Intertidal Salt Marshes",FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,"Salt marshes are under increasing anthropogenic pressures that have been reported to affect the diet of fish (e.g., change in prey composition and availability), eventually resulting in alterations in their nursery function. Most studies in Europe are based on fish gut content analysis, which only reflect a small proportion of pressures to salt marshes, and do not necessarily reflect long-term disturbances. In this study, we investigated the impact of salt-marsh vegetation type on trophic network structures (i.e., fish diet and trophic position). Primary producers (particulate organic matter, microphytobenthos, and dominant terrestrial plants), potential aquatic and terrestrial prey, and fish of two dominant species (sea bass and thinlip mullet) were sampled during the summer of 2010 in four creeks from two sites from Western France (the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay and the Seine Estuary). Analysis was undertaken using C and N stable-isotope compositions. Tested response variables (diet and trophic position) suggested a dominant site effect and a weaker effect of surrounding vegetation type. Site effect was attributed to differences in anthropogenic nitrogen inputs (with a steep increase in the Mont-Saint Michel Bay) and tidal regime between the two bays, with more marine signatures associated with a higher frequency and duration of tidal flooding events in the Seine Estuary. A second hypothesis is that invasive Elytrigia acuta, which has recently replaced typical salt-marsh vegetation in Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, negatively impacted the native salt-marshes nursery function by modifying the access to terrestrial prey on this site. The trophic position of the sea bass and the thinlip mullet was unchanged by local salt marsh vegetation, and considered consistent with their diet.

Along this gradient, we observed an increase in the assimilation of pelagic-derived carbon from 25 to 75% throughout primary, secondary and tertiary consumers. This shift was overwhelmingly driven by the consumption of pelagic detritus by benthic primary consumers and was not accompanied by increased pelagic foraging by higher trophic level consumers. Our data also revealed a convergence of the carbon isotope ratios of pelagic and benthic food web endmembers in the warmest, most productive lakes indicating that the incorporation of terrestrial derived carbon into aquatic food webs increases as land use intensifies.

Feathers were collected from museum specimens or live individuals (collected between 1878 and 2019) in Tikapa Moana, the Hauraki Gulf, a marine habitat increasingly threatened by overfishing and urbanisation.

Contemporary delta N-15 and delta C-13 values were consistent with existing data on diet and foraging distribution of the 5 seabird species. Values of delta N-15 declined in only 1 of 5 species studied, suggesting little change in the trophic position of the other species over time. However, delta C-13 values declined in 3 species, and a lack of change in the delta N-15 and delta C-13 values of forage fish suggests that this change is reflective of a behavioural shift in the distribution of the birds.

   response to habitat degradation",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Diet specificity is likely to be the key predictor of a predator's vulnerability to changing habitat and prey conditions. Understanding the degree to which predatory coral reef fishes adjust or maintain prey choice, in response to declines in coral cover and changes in prey availability, is critical for predicting how they may respond to reef habitat degradation. Here, we use stable isotope analyses to characterize the trophic structure of predator-prey interactions on coral reefs of the Keppel Island Group on the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. These reefs, previously typified by exceptionally high coral cover, have recently lost much of their coral cover due to coral bleaching and frequent inundation by sediment-laden, freshwater flood plumes associated with increased rainfall patterns. Long-term monitoring of these reefs demonstrates that, as coral cover declined, there has been a decrease in prey biomass, and a shift in dominant prey species from pelagic plankton-feeding damselfishes to territorial benthic algal-feeding damselfishes, resulting in differences in the principal carbon pathways in the food web. Using isotopes, we tested whether this changing prey availability could be detected in the diet of a mesopredator (coral grouper, Plectropomus maculatus). The delta C-13 signature in grouper tissue in the Keppel Islands shifted from a more pelagic to a more benthic signal, demonstrating a change in carbon sources aligning with the change in prey availability due to habitat degradation. Grouper with a more benthic carbon signature were also feeding at a lower trophic level, indicating a shortening in food chains. Further, we found a decline in the coral grouper population accompanying a decrease in total available prey biomass. Thus, while the ability to adapt diets could ameliorate the short-term impacts of habitat degradation on mesopredators, long-term effects may negatively impact mesopredator populations and alter the trophic structure of coral reef food webs.",10.1002/ece3.2805,"coral reefs; coral trout; food chains; habitat degradation;

The results suggest that increased degredation leads to an increased amount of foraging in the benthic environment relative to grouper from less degraded sites. Also, the increased reliance on benthic carbon over time with coral bleaching and sediment loading reflect this shift as well. The authors suggest the reason for the shift is due to decreased prey availability in the degraded pelagic habitats.

We analyzed stable isotope ratios in skin and fatty acid signatures in blubber samples of whales, as well as in seven potential prey species, and diet was quantitatively assessed using Bayesian isotopic models. An abrupt change in fin whale dietary niche coincided with a decrease in biomass of their predominant prey, Arctic krill (Thysanoessa spp.). This dietary niche widening toward generalist diets occurred in nearly 60% of sampled individuals. The fin whale population, typically composed of specialists of either krill or lipid-rich pelagic fishes, shifted toward one composed either of krill specialists or true generalists feeding on various zooplankton and fish prey.

During this period, the proportion of pelagic fish from the Estuary was significantly greater than pelagic fish from the Gulf in fin whale diets. In 2002 and subsequent years, fin whales appeared to feed to a lower extent on Arctic krill/copepods and capelin/herring from the Estuary (together 56.9 ± 19.8%), and incorporated northern krill and to a lesser extent amphipods as other prey in their diet. It was also estimated that whales consumed a higher proportion of capelin/herring from the Gulf during 2002Ð2006 compared to previous years. As a result, there was a significant change in the specialization index of fin whales over the study period. Dietary habits shifted around 2002 from diets that were more typical of specialist feeders with _ varying from 0.51 to 0.89 (_mean = 0.68), to some that included true generalist feeders (_min = 0.21). The authors suggest that the diversification of fin whale diets after 2001 likely occurred in response to a decrease in Arctic krill abundance or availability during this period of warming oceanographic conditions and community changes. Overall, the diet of fin whales shifted from individuals being highly specialized on Arctic Krill prior to 2001, to a substantial shift overtime to consuming pelagic forage fish, like capelin.

An interesting aspect of the impact of regime shift is that alternative regimes may induce distinct shifts in energy pathways; these have been less tested than structural changes. This paper addresses this by using stable isotopes to establish the energy pathways in fish communities. We specifically focus on the impact of regime shift on changes of the energy pathways, and how the magnitude and direction of these changes affect the local community. We found that energy pathways significantly varied among the planktivorous, benthivorous, and piscivorous trophic guilds as a result of the alternative regimes. The regime shift from a clear to a turbid state altered the food web towards planktonic energy pathways and truncated food chain length, which is indicative of less ecological efficiency. This was confirmed by the adaptive foraging strategies of prevalent omnivores in the current communities.

Previous work demonstrating the negative impacts of AgNP exposure on periphyton production suggests benthic primary production could be reduced in aquatic ecosystems impacted by AgNP discharge. To evaluate the potential for AgNPs to alter benthic-pelagic coupling in aquatic ecosystems, tissue-stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen from northern pike (Esox lucius) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were measured before, during, and after the addition of AgNPs to a whole-lake ecosystem, and compared to those collected from a nearby reference lake. A shift in carbon isotope ratios toward more negative values was observed in both P. flavescens and E. lucius collected from the lake where AgNPs were added, with no shift in similar magnitude observed in E. lucius from the reference lake. Consequently, Bayesian estimates of benthic energy consumed decreased by 32% for P. flavescens and by 40% for E. lucius collected after AgNP additions relative to pre-addition estimates, greater in magnitude or opposite in direction of trends observed in our reference lake. Analyses suggest no changes in fish nitrogen isotope ratios related to AgNP additions. We hypothesize that the observed reduction in littoral energy use of fish reported here is a response to AgNP settling in littoral benthic habitats-the main habitat in lakes supporting periphyton-as AgNP has been shown elsewhere to significantly reduce the rates of periphyton production. Further, our study highlights the need to broaden the scope of risk assessments for AgNPs and other emerging contaminants prone to settling to consider habitat-specific impacts on resource utilization by organisms after their release into aquatic ecosystems.",10.1111/jfb.15526 [doi],Esocidae and Percidae and food webs and habitat de-coupling and nanoparticles and silver,Aquatic,Lake,IISD-ELA,Spatiotemporal,Northern pike,Density,Pollution,Silver contamination,% littoral derived carbon,fin,Logan et al. 2008 lipid correction,_13C was 3.14ä ± 0ä,Benthos and zooplankton,Decrease,"The authors analyzed N and C data from Northern pike in a reference lake without any exposure to AgNP (silver nanoparticles) pollution and a lake that had been experimentally treated with AgNP.

Riparian spiders that predate on emergent aquatic invertebrates can contribute to carbon flux and the structure of aquatic and riparian food webs. The impact of riparian degradation on spiders in temperate rivers of Australia and their role in this broader ecosystem function is poorly understood. We surveyed the riparian zone of four rivers of south-western Australia in areas of natural intact vegetation and degraded agricultural land to explore whether riparian spider abundance, and diversity may be affected by changes to riparian condition. We also assessed the impact of the riparian condition on carbon fluxes between aquatic and terrestrial environments, using stable isotope analysis. We found overall abundance of riparian spiders was higher in degraded agricultural sites compared to natural intact sites and the structure of spider assemblages was different. Orb-weaver spiders (Araneidae and Tetragnathidae) were found to be more abundant in agricultural areas where canopy cover and understory are sparse as a result of livestock grazing and trampling. The contribution of carbon from aquatic invertebrates in a natural intact site was 48.5% for Orb-weavers and 41.6% for Cursorial Hunter spiders but reduced to 19.6% and 39.9% respectively in a degraded agricultural site.

Very little is known about the ecosystem impacts of river salinization despite expectations for global increases in salinization with growing water demand and climate change. In some rivers in the southwestern United States, salinization has occurred as a result of natural saline inputs exacerbated by flow alteration and other anthropogenic impacts. Salinization in the Pecos River has been linked to declines in fish diversity, but impacts on the structure of aquatic food webs have not been investigated. 2. We assessed variation in local food webs along the longitudinal gradient of the main stem Pecos River by estimating carbon sources, trophic positions and assemblage-wide trophic structure for aquatic consumers at 12 sites using stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15). Temporal variation across seasons was also examined for common fish species at a subset of sites. 3. Consumer richness, food-chain length and assemblage-wide niche breadth were inversely related to specific conductivity. Mixing models revealed differences in sources of dietary carbon supporting fish production along the longitudinal fluvial gradient, with a shift towards reliance on algal production in the salinized reaches of the river. Trophic niche breadth was greatest for assemblages in less degraded sites with higher fish species richness. Local food webs in salinized sites were dominated by euryhaline species and had shorter food chains and narrower assemblage-wide niche breadths. Across seasons, delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures remained fairly constant for five common fish species. 4. Our results suggest that salinization in portions of the Pecos River constrains the diversity of consumers and trophic resources in local food webs.

Riparian systems may be particularly vulnerable to ALAN. We investigated the impacts of ALAN on invertebrate community composition and food web characteristics for linked aquatic-terrestrial ecosystems. We focused on food chain length (FCL), a central property of ecological communities that can influence their structure, function, and stability; and the contribution of aquatically derived energy (i.e., nutritional subsidies originating from stream periphyton). We collected terrestrial arthropods and emergent aquatic insects from a suite of stream and wetland sites in Columbus, Ohio, USA. Stable isotopes of carbon ((13) C) and nitrogen ((15) N) were used to infer FCL and contribution of aquatically derived energy. We found that moderate-to-high levels of ALAN altered invertebrate community composition, favoring primarily predators and detritivores. Impacts of ALAN, however, were very taxon specific as illustrated, for example, by the negative impact of ALAN on the abundance of orb-web spiders belonging to the families Tetragnathidae and Araneidae: key invertebrate riparian predators. Most notably, we observed decreases in both invertebrate FCL and reliance on aquatically derived energy under ALAN (although aquatic energetic contributions appeared to increase again at higher levels of ALAN), in addition to shifts in the timing of reciprocal nutritional subsidies. Our study demonstrates that ALAN can alter the flows of energy between aquatic and terrestrial systems, thereby representing an environmental perturbation that can cross ecosystem boundaries.

There was no relationship between nutrient enrichment and the proportion of planktonic versus periphytic C in fish. Proportion of planktonic C in fish increased significantly with hydraulic residence time (F = 5.68, R-2 = 0.42, p = 0.044). Riverine wetlands generally had lowest proportions of planktonic C in fish, dendritic wetlands were intermediate, and lagoon wetlands had highest proportions.

   independent of trophic status: Evidence from amino acid stable isotopes",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Lakes are recipients of allochthonous organic matter and nutrients. However, the importance of these subsidies for food webs and how they vary with lake trophic status remains unclear, especially for large lakes. We assessed the source and fate of organic matter and nutrients in seven perialpine lakes across a gradient of trophic status. We measured carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of amino acids of lake-residing Atlantic trout, Salmo trutta, to determine the source of primary production (i.e., how carbon is fixed in the ecosystem) and how it is transferred through food webs, respectively. Based on essential amino acid carbon fingerprinting, we estimated the probability of organic carbon originating from autochthonous (algal), allochthonous (terrestrial plant), and recycled (bacterial) sources. In addition, we used amino acid delta N-15 to track how this primary production is transferred to consumers in general, and by using different trophic amino acids (glutamic acid and alanine), identify the trophic pathways involving either metazoan or protozoans. We found a high likelihood of autochthonous origin of organic carbon (86 +/- 9\%) in trout that contrasted with allochthonous origins of particulate organic matter and some sediments. We showed that those estimates are good proxies of source reliance. Our results also highlighted the importance of bacterial origin of organic carbon in fish (12\%). The likely autochthonous origin of this carbon was supported by trophic markers (Ala delta N-15) that suggest the role of protists in transferring recycled organic carbon up the food web. While the sources of nitrogen sustaining food webs varied among lakes, we found a conserved carbon fingerprinting of fish. Overall, this suggests an uncoupling between the source of nutrients and organic carbon in large perialpine lakes. Across a wide range of trophic status (c. 2 orders of magnitude range of phosphorus concentration), several lines of evidence suggested that perialpine lake food webs shared a common reliance on autochthonous and bacterial production. Our study is the first to quantify the dependence on allochthonous organic carbon in lake food webs based on new amino acid stable isotope markers (carbon fingerprinting and Ala delta N-15) and shows promise for estimating the source of carbon fixation in ecosystems. Our results support previous suggestions that terrestrial organic carbon is a relatively minor source for aquatic consumers despite contributing to the pool of organic matter, and more importantly, its contribution does not vary substantially with trophic status in perialpine lakes.",10.1111/fwb.14071,"aquatic-terrestrial linkage; carbon fingerprinting; lake eutrophication;

A notable example is shallow lakes where human-induced eutrophication or water level fluctuation may result in a switch from a clear-water, macrophyte-dominated state to a turbid, phytoplankton-dominated state. Yet, few investigations have described synchronous changes in biotic assemblage composition and food web framework under such a shift between alternative states. We used stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes to test the extent to which switching from macrophyte to phytoplankton dominance in Lake Gucheng, triggered by a water level increase, would alter ecosystem structure and change the basal resources supporting the food web. We found that invertebrates and fish compensated for a reduction of macrophyte and epiphyte resources by deriving more energy from the alternative pelagic energy channel, where benthic invertebrates act as crucial links between primary producers and higher consumers by transporting Î´(13)C-depleted pelagic algae to the benthic zone.

A host of barriers to river flow increase the water residence time and sediment and nutrient retention in reservoirs worldwide, and potentially alter the balance between detritus-based and algae-based energy pathways in the downstream food webs. We explored this issue on the SŽlune River (Normandy, France), a small coastal stream that drains an agricultural catchment with high sediment runoff. Seasonal measurements of the following parameters were compared upstream and downstream of the reservoirs of two large dams (16 m and 36 m high): sediment fluxes, nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations, algal communities in the epilithic biofilm (taxonomic composition, biomass and growth), and benthic invertebrate communities (abundance and trophic guild structure). As anticipated, annual sediment fluxes were much lower downstream of the reservoirs, where significant decreases in water turbidity, phosphate and silicate concentrations were recorded. A higher chlorophyll a concentration in water and a higher contribution of pelagic algae taxa to the photosynthetic biofilm suggested drifting and deposition of reservoir-borne phytoplankton downriver. Photosynthetic biofilm growth was higher downstream of the reservoirs in spring and fall, and so was the abundance of herbivores in the invertebrate community, notably scrapers and algae eaters. Energy pathways within riverine food webs were traced using stable isotope analyses of carbon (C) and nitrogen in the tissues of aquatic consumers (invertebrates and fish). Mixing models revealed a discontinuity in the origin of the C entering the food webs along the river continuum, confirming a greater contribution of algal C to aquatic consumers downstream of the reservoirs.

The catchment of the Nevezis River, the sixth longest river in Lithuania, is among the most affected by agricultural activities. Although seriously disturbed by land reclamation and agricultural pollution, the Nevezis River still has natural, anthropogenically unaffected stretches. Fish species were studied at two sites of the upper part of the river with different hydrological regime, exhibiting clear differences in the trophic status of fish. The combined effect of hydrogeomorphic and water-chemistry variability on the stable isotope composition of fish assemblages in Lithuania has not been investigated. The presently reported study was intended to explore the possible effects of the riverbed morphology and agricultural activities on the chemistry and stable isotope composition of the three main fish species. Materials and methods. This study covered three species of freshwater fishes: the European perch, Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758; the roach, Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758); and the northern pike, Esox lucius Linnaeus, 1758. The sampling was performed in both natural and regulated river stretches using backpack electrofishing equipment. Stable isotope composition of the samples was revealed by applying stable isotope analyses (SIA) with an elemental analyser connected to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer.

Results. In the study sites on the Nevezis River, algal carbon isotope ratios were more C-13-depleted than those from terrestrial sources.

Before and four successive years after dam removal, we quantified density and trophic metrics of nearshore tetragnathid spiders and riparian swallows and their potential emergent-aquatic insect prey at two experimental reaches located within the former impoundment (one unrestored, one with channel restoration) and one control reach above an intact lowhead dam. We observed substantial annual variability in response variables; however, few patterns appear to be strongly linked to dam removal. We found negligible changes in emergent-insect biomass or community structure, although there were slight changes in the relative abundance of feeding modes (e.g., increased predators, decreased collector-gatherers). The most pronounced response was a similar to 9.9 times average decline in spider densities after dam removal at the restored reach. Stable-isotope analysis (C-13, N-15) indicated that changes in aquatically-derived energy (i.e., nutritional subsidies derived from aquatic primary producers) to riparian consumers generally showed comparable patterns system-wide; swallow aquatically-derived energy declined more in the restored vs. control reach by the final year of the study. Trophic position (TP) of spiders showed little change post-dam removal, while swallow TP converged slightly between control and experimental reaches after dam removal. Collectively, we interpret our results as evidence that lowhead dam removal can prompt relatively nuanced shifts in aquatic-terrestrial trophic dynamics, regardless of intensive channel-restoration activities. In contrast, we found that broader-scale forcings (e.g., discharge, regional temperature) may be more influential in governing cross-boundary trophic interactions than the perturbations related to lowhead dam removal.
